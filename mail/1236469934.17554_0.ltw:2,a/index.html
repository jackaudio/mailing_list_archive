Michael, Paul has answered you on jack-devel. See below.

Note: I'm cross-posting this mail to linux-audio-dev, since Michael has recently 
subscribed to it. At least, we should be able to discuss together in there.

&gt; I have no idea how any of you have kept this conversation going when one 
&gt; of the main protagonists is not even subscribed to one of the two 
&gt; mailing lists, and i suspect that one of the others isn't subscribed to 
&gt; the other. perhaps the FFmpeg-devel list doesn't require membership.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i've finally had enough of reading Michael's stuff about 
&gt; buffers, timing and so forth and felt obligated to comment.
&gt; 
&gt; michael - i would politely request that you stop shooting off at the 
&gt; mouth about stuff that the JACK community has been dealing with for more 
&gt; than 9 years.
&gt; 
&gt; you do not need to write your own ring buffer code - JACK's is LGPL'ed 
&gt; and you are free (and probably even recommended) to copy it. 
&gt; furthermore, you would be very foolish to imagine (especially based on 
&gt; your incredibly naive comments about uint8_t) that you understand the 
&gt; subtleties of these buffers. the JACK community (and a couple of other 
&gt; exclusively audio-focused development groups) have been working with 
&gt; this buffer design for many, many years, and we are absolutely confident 
&gt; that our buffers are (a) SMP/multi-core safe (b) as efficient as they 
&gt; can be without using assembler. you should also be aware that there are 
&gt; very good arguments for  the current structure of the ringbuffer code, 
&gt; which explicitly does NOT use any memory barriers. if you don't 
&gt; understand why it works without them, then you should probably refrain 
&gt; from commenting on the design of these buffers at all.
&gt;
