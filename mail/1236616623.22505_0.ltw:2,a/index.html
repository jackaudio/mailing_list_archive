&gt; Michael, Paul has answered you on jack-devel. See below.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: I'm cross-posting this mail to linux-audio-dev, since Michael has recently 
&gt; subscribed to it. At least, we should be able to discuss together in there.

&gt; &gt; I have no idea how any of you have kept this conversation going when one

&gt; &gt; the other. 

&gt; &gt; perhaps the FFmpeg-devel list doesn't require membership.

it does, though we have some fearless admin that occasionally in the past
went over the held mails, not sure if he did this recently though.


&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; anyway, i've finally had enough of reading Michael's stuff about 
&gt; &gt; buffers, timing and so forth and felt obligated to comment.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; michael - i would politely request that you stop shooting off at the 
&gt; &gt; mouth about stuff that the JACK community has been dealing with for more 
&gt; &gt; than 9 years.

Olivier had posted several patches to ffmpeg-dev that add libjack support
and some "timefilter".
And these contributions are certainly appreciated!

Ive reviewed them and suggested improvments, the timefilter patch has
already reached svn (a bug less, time values have roughly half the error
from before and variable time periods being supported now)
You arent suggesting we should accept patches without review, are you?


&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; you do not need to write your own ring buffer code - JACK's is LGPL'ed 
&gt; &gt; and you are free (and probably even recommended) to copy it. 

we have our own ring buffer as well in libavutil/fifo.c|h, it just had a
little issue with an unuseable element, that ive just fixed.
i see jacks ringbuffer has the same issue, in addition it seems limited
to sizes that are a power of 2.
and considering ours supports user provided functions instead of just memcpy()
to access the fifo directly and has just 1/3 the number of lines of code
than jacks, id prefer to keep ours.


&gt; &gt; furthermore, you would be very foolish to imagine (especially based on 
&gt; &gt; your incredibly naive comments about uint8_t) that you understand the 
&gt; &gt; subtleties of these buffers. the JACK community (and a couple of other 
&gt; &gt; exclusively audio-focused development groups) have been working with 
&gt; &gt; this buffer design for many, many years, and we are absolutely confident 
&gt; &gt; that our buffers are (a) SMP/multi-core safe (b) as efficient as they 
&gt; &gt; can be without using assembler. you should also be aware that there are 
&gt; &gt; very good arguments for  the current structure of the ringbuffer code, 
&gt; &gt; which explicitly does NOT use any memory barriers. if you don't 
&gt; &gt; understand why it works without them, then you should probably refrain 
&gt; &gt; from commenting on the design of these buffers at all.

It works because you are lucky

Many things microsoft did are stupid, but not doing something just because
microsoft did it is even more stupid. If everything ms did were stupid they
would be bankrupt already.
