it does, though we have some fearless admin that occasionally in the past
went over the held mails, not sure if he did this recently though.

Olivier had posted several patches to ffmpeg-dev that add libjack support
and some "timefilter".
And these contributions are certainly appreciated!

Ive reviewed them and suggested improvments, the timefilter patch has
already reached svn (a bug less, time values have roughly half the error
from before and variable time periods being supported now)
You arent suggesting we should accept patches without review, are you?

we have our own ring buffer as well in libavutil/fifo.c|h, it just had a
little issue with an unuseable element, that ive just fixed.
i see jacks ringbuffer has the same issue, in addition it seems limited
to sizes that are a power of 2.
and considering ours supports user provided functions instead of just memcpy()
to access the fifo directly and has just 1/3 the number of lines of code
than jacks, id prefer to keep ours.

It works because you are lucky

Many things microsoft did are stupid, but not doing something just because
microsoft did it is even more stupid. If everything ms did were stupid they
would be bankrupt already.
