Dear Linux Audio Developers,

as indicated by St&#xE9;phane in his presentation [1] he gave at LAC2009 today, I 
finally handed in my diploma thesis, which I announced here [2]. You can 
download the full text of the thesis here:
	
	&lt;http://www1.inf.tu-dresden.de/~s3418892/diplom.pdf&gt; [3].

If you want to take a glimpse at the code, you can get a (still very dirty) 
snapshot of the code here [4]. 

The abstract of the thesis:

&gt; Several available free software audio solutions were analyzed, and
&gt; Jackdmp&#x2014;a C++ reimplementation of the renowned JACK Audio Connection
&gt; Kit&#x2014;was selected as the most appropriate solution for a real-time audio
&gt; architecture on DROPS. The JACK sound architecture provides the lowest
&gt; processing latency possible on a desktop computer for a given set of sound
&gt; card parameters. It reduces the latency jitter caused by software to zero
&gt; and synchronizes streams at sample accuracy.

&gt;     A real-time admission scheme for JACK clients is proposed.
&gt; The execution time of different typical JACK clients was analyzed with
&gt; measurements to validate the assumptions the proposal is based on,
&gt; but also to gain further knowledge about their timing behavior. 
&gt; The measurements showed that the condition set by Paul Davis&#x2014;the 
&gt; time to process a client must be a linear function of the buffer size&#x2014;holds
&gt; for all tested clients.

&gt;    Jackdmp was ported to DROPS. The developed design of the port and its
&gt; implementation is documented here. Measurements showed that&#x2014;although
&gt; the real-time performance of the Linux kernel is continously being improved
&gt; in the mainline and on special external branches&#x2014;DROPS can provide a
&gt; signaling latency that is two times lower on average than the values that
&gt; can be achieved on the same machine running with a low latency patched
&gt; Linux kernel. Thus, it can be stated that DROPS is well-suited for
&gt; real-time audio processing and that the pursued path to use it as the
&gt; foundation of a truly real-time capable audio workstation should be
&gt; followed.

As of the project's future: I will try to get the ALSA driver and the 
connection with L4Linux working until the presentation of the project (no 
date set so far, but probably in 2--4 weeks or so). If all works well, we 
will consider releasing a demo disc and / or a Youtube demonstration for 
interested developers and power users of the system then. And then we'll 
see :).

Kind regards --- and those of you who are in Parma: Have an interesting 
conference and a great time in Italy! ---,

micu
