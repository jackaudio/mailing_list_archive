I don't know about jitter, but certainly a few years ago, you  
sometimes got stalls - eg. under heavy DMA load. That may not be an  
issue with modern CPUs and chipsets. I think I posted some code that  
demonstrated it to the l-a-d list at the time, but good luck finding  
it :)

The TSC is only required to be monotonic, so you wont get any  
guarantees, just practical knowledge of whether you can get away with  
it or not.
