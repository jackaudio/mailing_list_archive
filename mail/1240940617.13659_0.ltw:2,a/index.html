&gt; I don't know about jitter, but certainly a few years ago, you sometimes got

&gt; list at the time, but good luck finding it :)
&gt;

Thanks for the warning. I'm not planning to run other programs or do any I/O
besides audio though. And to avoid rescheduling while my code
snippets run, I'll probably set the threads to SCHED_FIFO/99 too.
Hopefully that'll give accurate results.

Thanks.



&gt; in the absence of frequency scaling, there is no jitter that can be

&gt; computer.

Sorry, really bad use of the word "jitter" on my part. I ment
slightly wrong values caused by unsynchronized tsc clocks.
