Resolution on my machine is 1 / 14.318180 MHz. Frequency can vary
typically from 12 to 16 MHz. Access is usually rather fast through MMIO.
Accuracy can vary depending on hardware and environment, same applies
even more for TSC.

In my opinion, clock_gettime() with CLOCK_MONOTONIC is pretty good if
kernel is using reasonably good clock source. You can check the current
one by "cat
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource". Over
rather long periods, CLOCK_REALTIME with good NTP sync would probably be
a good choice.

Over what time span you would need that 0.1 ms accuracy?
