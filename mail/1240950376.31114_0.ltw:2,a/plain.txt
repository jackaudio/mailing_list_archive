I would just warn that, AFAIK, on some CPUs frequency scaling affects
TSC while not on some others... And the frequency of CPU clock is not
necessarily very precise and can vary depending on hardware/temperature/etc.

Some hardwares may employ spread spectrum on the clock - ie. generating
jitter on the clock to lower EMI.

Best option for timing is usually to use hardware intended for timing.
Kernel can use HPET as clock source with "clocksource=hpet" parameter.
