Thanks! I'll look closer at the jack code.

It shows hpet.

Hard to say. This is for testing a couple of garbage collectors, and the
difference between worst case and best case can be quite high.
Worst-case is probably around 1ms, and best case maybe around 0.1ms.
It also depends on buffer settings, so I can use higher buffers
to get higher timings.

But calls to clock_gettime()/HPET/etc. will only happen maximum 6 times
per audio block, so clock_gettime()/HPET/etc. doesn't have to be extremely
efficient.
