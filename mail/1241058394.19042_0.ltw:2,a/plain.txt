With a modern kernel clock_gettime() should always be the best choice.
 The kernel's timekeeping system has been completely redone since the
days when JACK needed to use its own timers.  Linux is now very good
at picking the cheapest working clock source.

If there were no need to support old kernels, I think JACK's hardware
timer support could be removed entirely in favor of the POSIX clock
api.
