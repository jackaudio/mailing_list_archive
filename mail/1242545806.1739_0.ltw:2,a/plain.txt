Fons,

I really appreciate your feedback...,  but AFAICS Qjackctl is  
*absolutely* not using the DBUS layer!

With jackdmp/jack2 compiled with default settings (that is *not*  
using the --dbus at configure step), then it should absolutely behave  
as jack1 was behaving.

And I guess Rui can better answer the points concerning "~/.jackdrc,"  
and son on.

Stéphane
