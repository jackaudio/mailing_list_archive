Then please tell what this is:  (ps -ef output)

fons      2444     1  0 10:43 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/jackdbus auto

Killing this makes qjackctl behave normally again,
and allows me to start the server configured in it
Setup window instead of getting a different one.

Qjackctl is not involved in autostarting jackd, so I
repeat the first question:

   Which parameters are used for such an autostart ?
   Certainly not the ones in ~/.jackdrc, these would
   have been correct.

Given the usual convention of  "APPNAME" using 
"~/APPNAMErc" for default settings, why does jackd
not do this ? I know the file is created by qjackctl,
but qjackctl completely ignores the settings there,
so the file is cleary not meant for its own use.

Ciao,
