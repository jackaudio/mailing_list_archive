Compile time ? I'm a simple user installing things from
a reputable distro.

Are you serious ?

When jackd is autostarted by an app (with the wrong
settings, a separate problem), it creates a dbus daemon
that seems to prevent qjackctl to start jackd with
the right settings. The result is a jackd that does
not any way correspond the the setup in qjackctl, and
there is no way to escape from this, except by manually 
killing the daemon. Do you call that 'working pretty
well' ?

When qjackctl starts displaying ports that don't
exist anymore and does not display those that
do exist (no problem with jack-0.116.1) do you
call that 'working pretty well' ?

I'd call it completely broken.

Ciao,
