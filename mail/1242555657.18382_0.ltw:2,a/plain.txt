Ok. a few things here:

- dbus is not the default compile time config option. Your distro should
probably disable it (until it's stable and shiny)
- When dbus is active, it is indeed not backwards compatible with the
legacy autostart feature... I agree it might need fixing
- The behavior you describe with ports is indeed a bug and needs fixing

And for the record, "fixing a mess" doesn't always need to be "deleting all
the features that might create it".
