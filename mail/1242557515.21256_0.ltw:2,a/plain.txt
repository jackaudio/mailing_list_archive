qjackctl only writes to ~/.jackdrc *iif* you opt to (see Setup/Misc/Save
JACK audio server configuration). otherwise it *never* makes use of that
file ie. it never auto-starts jackd implicitly; it only does start jackd
explicitly if none is found running atm.

if you really want several jackd server running simultaneously you'll
have to take use of the JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER environment variable to tell
qjackctl which server it will refer to. in fact, that is the only tricky
way for you to have several qjackctl instances running as well.

Stephane is right, qjackctl makes no use of the d-bus interface in
jackaudio.org domain, although the latest in qjackctl cvs has some d-bus
stuff of its own (rncbc.org domain) and only serves for
starting/stopping qjackctl control--found useful for example to any
system suspend/resume script you may think of.

otoh, the only other jack application i know of that writes to
~/.jackdrc is ardour; have a look at your use case when starting jackd
from behind ardour's open session dialog...
