That's unfair. Read the archives. There are more arguments to that.

It is not unreasonable. No one said you *had* to use dbus. This needs
fixing and until it is fixed, packagers should be advised to disable dbus.

The code for the legacy behavior might make jack a few lines lighter, but
have you looked at qjackctl's code ? Starting jack via some pseudo command
line scripting using Qt and c++ is not something I'd like to maintain. The
thing is, Rui had no choice since it is the only way one could build a
control application with the legacy jack. That's one of the things a
control API is meant to change.
