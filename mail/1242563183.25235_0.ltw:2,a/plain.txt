Starting a process in C/C++ is easy enough, and if Qt
makes it difficult that's Qt's problem.

Anyway, you don't need dbus, just provide a start()
function in the control interface, accepting the
options in a string, or as an argv[]. Why doesn't
this exist ? Why do you have to go through all the
movements of scanning parameters, types, ranges,
setting them one by one, if you already know the
command line (which will be the case in 99.99% of
cases jack is started) ?
