Subject:     Re: [LAD] more jack/qjackctl madness : some comments

After all these discussions on JACK2, D-Bus and Qjackctl issues, here  
are some general comments:

1) JACK2 *default* compilation mode defines the same starting scheme  
at JACK1 was doing. So (beside possible bugs) it is supposed to be  
completely "interchangeable" with JACK1. It can be controled with  
Qjackctl as usual.

2) JACK2 compiled in D-Bus is supposed to be controlled by a D-Bus  
based control application... (jack_control is a simple python example  
of a control application part of the package). Using JACK2 compiled  
in D-Bus with Qjackctl is a "receipe for trouble", even if if can be  
done in some simple use cases. (The point is that in this case the  
client auto-start feature starts the "jackdbus" exe instead of  
"jackd" with all of the related "settings" issues).

3) The port issue Fons told about in Qjackctl  0.3.4 seems to be a  
Qjackctl bug, so has to be fixed at the right place.

I don't see right now any raisonable way to fix this mess, better  
than adding even more complexity in the design... (Nedko any idea?)  
Otherwise I guess the only way is to make this totally clear for  
packagers :  1) is the standard way that maintains complete  
compatibility with legacy applications and control applications. 2)  
is the "new" way to be used with new D-Bus based control application  
(patchage ??)...  So it would mean 2  separated packages.
