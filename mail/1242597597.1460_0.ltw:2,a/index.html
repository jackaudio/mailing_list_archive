&gt;&gt; After all these discussions on JACK2, D-Bus and Qjackctl issues, here
are
&gt;&gt; some general comments:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1) JACK2 *default* compilation mode defines the same starting scheme at
&gt;&gt; JACK1 was doing. So (beside possible bugs) it is supposed to be
&gt;&gt; completely
&gt;&gt; "interchangeable" with JACK1. It can be controled with Qjackctl as
usual.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2) JACK2 compiled in D-Bus is supposed to be controlled by a D-Bus based
&gt;&gt; control application... (jack_control is a simple python example of a
&gt;&gt; control
&gt;&gt; application part of the package). Using JACK2 compiled in D-Bus with
&gt;&gt; Qjackctl is a "receipe for trouble", even if if can be done in some
&gt;&gt; simple
&gt;&gt; use cases. (The point is that in this case the client auto-start feature
&gt;&gt; starts the "jackdbus" exe instead of "jackd" with all of the related
&gt;&gt; "settings" issues).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3) The port issue Fons told about in Qjackctl &#xA0;0.3.4 seems to be a
&gt;&gt; Qjackctl
&gt;&gt; bug, so has to be fixed at the right place.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't see right now any raisonable way to fix this mess, better than
&gt;&gt; adding even more complexity in the design... (Nedko any idea?) Otherwise
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; guess the only way is to make this totally clear for packagers : &#xA0;1) is
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; standard way that maintains complete compatibility with legacy
&gt;&gt; applications
&gt;&gt; and control applications. 2) is the "new" way to be used with new D-Bus
&gt;&gt; based control application (patchage ??)... &#xA0;So it would mean 2
&gt;&gt; &#xA0;separated
&gt;&gt; packages.
&gt; 
&gt; this sounds like a mess. there is a control API. i believe it was
&gt; agreed that the control API could be accessed directly (from C/C++
&gt; etc), or via other systems for which translators/layers were added
&gt; (e.g. DBus). i can see no reason why anyone would want to use choose
&gt; between a JACK server that can be controlled via either DBus or the
&gt; control API but not both. what is going on?

I can't tell about the c/c++ API since I'm not really using it. The issue
here is with the legacy way of doing things: controlling jack from the
command line and it's set of switches, playing with PIDs, redirecting some
output...

Legacy can't work well along control API.
