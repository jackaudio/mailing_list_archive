That itself is not the source of the problems.

The source is that even after the server that was started
as explained above has been terminated, D-Bus leaves a
daemon running that tries to be clever but gets it wrong.
Which effectively blocks whatever the user wants to do,
as it only allows to restart the previous server and 
even restarts it before anyone has asked for it.
