Using the "dbus ate my babies" matra is causing mess because other
people don't think so. Using dbus interface in qjackctl would fix lot of
this mess and this is the reason I asked Rui about that. Of course "dbus
ate my babies" ppl would see usage of jackdbus in qjackctl as a bad
thing.

Does qjackctl support headless and multiserver jack setups?
How headless setups work? When someone logins through ssh, does it
access jackd server that runs as same user?
