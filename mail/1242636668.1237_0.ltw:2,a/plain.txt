main trouble, imo, is that jackdbus is currently not playing fair game
with qjackctl wrt. jackd auto-start functionality.

as noted in one my other post, qjackctl always issues jack_client_open()
with *JackNoStartServer* option, which explicitly instructs on jack stack
for *never* start jackd on its call. apparently, jackdbus lacks this call
and starts jackd no matter what, giving us all the "ate my babies" mantra
;)

so it seems like just a missing piece in the jackdbus implementation re.
the jack api. it this stands true, i guess it should be easily fixed so
that future jackdbus and legacy qjackctl can still live on together for
many years to come ;)

well, of course, being qjackctl a X client, you can run qjackctl on the
headless machine and render the GUI on your local X server (ie. your
headtop, desktop, laptop, whatever) via ssh -X and DISPLAY trickery. if
you add that to disparate JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER environment settings, you
can have control of multiple jackd servers, either local or even remote.

cheers
