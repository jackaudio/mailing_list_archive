Subject:     Re: [LAD] [Jack-Devel] more jack/qjackctl madness

So again, i'll ask the question.

Will we continue to have a Jack version minus the dbus infrastructure,
once jack2 is released?

Or are we destined to be dragged into a "compulsory" hybrid?

I share Fon's concerns, and still don't understand why the dbus/pulse
momentum is taking precedence over what has been up to now, a great
audio solution for any user who wants to write and create music.

I'm not a coder, but i'll ask the jack team, who i have a lot of
respect for, to take a step back and have another look at the bigger
picture again. Dbus may be a way into a partnership with Pulse, but
that implies a degree of compulsory requirement for the user.

And i don't think answering with "So don't use it" is an answer if
there's a question over the persistence of Dbus and Pulse overriding
the users intent.

Fon's description of "Big Brother" seems more applicable, and less
humorous, the more one thinks about this.

Alex.

p.s. I'm practical about software, so the Dbus "mantra" means nothing to me.
