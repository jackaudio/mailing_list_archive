There are three packaging scenarios described in

http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/JackDbusPackaging

This document is created packagers can choose how to package jack. The
mixed setup is can easily lead to user frustration and this is
explained. I personally use the mixed setup but i know how the whole
mixed system behaves and I need to start jackd occasionally. I wouldn't
recommend packaging mixed setup. In ubuntu packages I've created
jackdbus is separate package. jackd is separate package too. They both
implement jack server virtual package. Packagers must choose between
classic jackd or dbus-only scenarios unless they want to cause pain to
their users.

Some more things I've implemented in the ubuntu packaging...
Only dbus control apps depend on jackdbus package. qjackctl depends on
jackd package. So if you install qjackctl but dont want (or dont know
about) jackdbus you get no dbus. If you install lpatchage or laditools
you get dbus setup. Users don't care about jackd vs jackdbus. They care
about the frontends. If they are used to qjackctl+jackd they will use
that and will get no "dbus ate my babies" feeling. If they like ladi
control apps, they will not use jackd.
