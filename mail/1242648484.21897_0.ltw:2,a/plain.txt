I have asked similar questions with pretty much the same intent re the compile 
time issue twice now and don't recall seeing a response to either.

Also, I have not seen anyone who is "championing" the dbus / pulse side of 
things explain what is happening to Fons. It almost seems like they are 
telling him he can't be seeing what he is reporting.

So, dbus guys, how is it that dbus is (re)starting on qjackctl launch? (Fons, 
isn't that what you are saying?) And why is it starting a jackd with 
different parameters that are in the rc file and in the qjackctl setup 
config?

How does dbus know what parameters to start jack with? Where is that 
configured? (Perhaps this will solve the issue, I don't recall this 
information passing before my eyes in this thread so far.)

all the best,
