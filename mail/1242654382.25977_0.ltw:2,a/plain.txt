Frankly I don't give a damn for that spec, or in fact
anything from that self-styled group of ******* who have
apparently never in their lives seen a computer without
a running desktop, have no idea of how things are done
on a Unix-like system, are the source of all misery I've
been confronted with lately, and are slowly turning Linux
into something worse than Windows (I mean freedesktop.org).

To start with, jackd is not a desktop app, and Unix/Linux
apps are traditionally configured using an ~/***rc file. 

Ciao,
