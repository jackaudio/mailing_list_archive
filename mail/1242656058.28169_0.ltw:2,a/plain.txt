Fons I think we can both read C code, right?

From posix/JackPosixServerLaunch.cpp, line 166:

static int start_server(const char* server_name, jack_options_t options)
{
    if ((options & JackNoStartServer) || getenv("JACK_NO_START_SERVER")) {
        return 1;
    }

#if defined(JACK_DBUS)
    return start_server_dbus(server_name);
#else
....
    jackd fork/exec stuff
....



presence of process with "jackdbus auto' commandline those not mean that
*server* is started. This is the dbus service, not the jack server
running.
