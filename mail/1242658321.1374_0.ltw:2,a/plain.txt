Some more words about that:

JACK2 SVN makes now clear what can be built:

- "classic" JACK : this target compiles the "jackd" executable. This  
exe behaves exactly as JACK1 is behaving (beside possible bugs). This  
target is the *default* one (that is the one resulting from "./waf  
configure). This version is meant to be used with usual tools  
Qjackctl, Ardour... (to start the server)... and so on.

- D-Bus JACK: this target compiles the "jackdbus" executable *only*  
(that is the "jackd" is not compiled anymore). This target is obtained  
using --dbus at configure time. This version is meant to be controled  
with D-Bus based control applications (Nedko please clarify this  
point...)

- both targets can be mixed but a WARNING is issued at configure time;  
that is "./waf configure  --dbus --classic" will compile both "jackd"   
and "jackdbus"  executable. This is to be done only by people who know  
exactly what they are doing.

Packagers are then strongly recommended to prepare the "classic"  or  
the "D-Bus" JACK2. Dependancies have to be handled accordingly (Nedko  
please clarify this point...)
The "mixed" target should *not be used* for packaging.
