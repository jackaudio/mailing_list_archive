It is involved in what happenes. At least from what I've got about the
problem you have.

You have installed jack package that does not work well with
qjackctl (dbus enabled one). Your application autostarted jack server
through dbus. But you havent configured it. QJackCtl is dbus
ignorant. You should not use qjackctl with jackdbus system. Unless you
know what you are doing. Or unless qjackctl gets jackdbus support.

jackdrc style commandline options for jackd are for jackd. They are not
used for jackdbus. They cant be used for jackdbus. Because of the object
activation works in all distributed object systems I know. This includes
DCOM and D-Bus.

So you complain about qjackctl missing support for jackdbus? Having that
will be nice :)
