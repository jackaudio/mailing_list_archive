It did not. No jack app here uses dbus.

What nonsense it this ? Everybody here tells me that 
the dbus support is build on top of the existing C
API and nothing else, that it just a communication
layer allowing you to access the C API.  Hence jackd
is the same with dbus or without. Or isn't this true,
and is the dbus support much more invasive than some
people want to admit ?

The client that autostarted a jackd did not use dbus.
When I later started qjackctl it did not use dbus.

Yet the 'jackdbus auto' daemon (which nobody needed
since all apps use the C API, but started anyway)
interferes with clients not using dbus at all.

Are you trying to say that on a jack+dbus system
*all* jack apps have to be dbus-aware (or fail) ?

Is that supposed to be funny ? 

Final remark: the dbus advocates here are seriously
contradicting themselves.
 
1. Dbus is just a communication layer.
2. Dbus adds functionality that can't be
   provided via the normal interfaces.

Both can't be true at the same time.
