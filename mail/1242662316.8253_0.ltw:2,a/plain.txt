If i got it right (dbus enabled libjack.so) then every jack app on your
machine uses dbus.

I dont get what you are talking about. Please explain.

libjack.so will not start jackd if compiled in dbus. Actually it can but
only if jack server start through dbus failed. Obvisouly it didnt
because you said that it got started with wrong arguments, right?

again if you have jackdbus enabled libjack.so all your clients DO
interact with dbus.

NO. dbus knowledge is behind libjack. But yes, they load libdbus.so when
they are started. Maybe you want to verify that with ldd?

Yes :)

no

it is distributed object model. this somewhat bigger than IPC.

and no again

It can be added. You can reinvent the wheel. You can reuse other already
invented mechanism. D-Bus was choosen because it is already quite
widespread in Linux systems.

they are both false but even if they were true they can be both true,
according to my understanding of logic :D if A and B are not corelated
then A and B can be true at the same time.
