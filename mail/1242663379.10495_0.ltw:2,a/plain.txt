In jackdbus system qjackctl is unusable for starting and configuring the
jack server (there is no jackd executable). However qjackctl can still
be used to monitor xruns and DSP load and as a patchbay application.

Yup I know that. And this is why it works as patchbay and monitor app
when used with jackdbus.

It is not breaking it is fixing issues. Or I'm wrong that qjackctl can't
show messages generated by jackd when jackd is autolaunched by regular
jack client application? Last time I checked those messages go to
application's stdout (that is inherited from the parent process - the
one of the normal jack client application).

The issue that started this holy war is that dbus enabled package that
contains also jackd got into the hands of Fons and ate his babies. The
problem is already fixed in svn. qjackctl will not work when dbus is
enabled unless both jackdbus and jackd are compiled and installed and
after the packager ignores the warning text at configure time. qjackctl
will not work because there will be not jackd executable installed.

Unless you point to what is wrong nobody who knows how jackdbus system
operates will understand what you mean.

I asked you to add support for jackdbus (there are qt dbus wrappers)
more than a year ago. It was in December 2007 IIRC. Not that I hoped a
lot even back then.
