&gt;&gt; from where i stand, qjackctl does not need jackdbus support whatsoever.
&gt;&gt; it's kind of the other way around, if i may say. and the way around is not
&gt;&gt; about qjackctl per se, but to plain old good command-line jackd.
&gt;
&gt; i'd like to clarify (again) based on ongoing conversations in #jack.
&gt;
&gt; the issue that qjackctl could consider is not jackdbus, or dbus in
&gt; general. its the JACK control API that was discussed at LAC 2008.
&gt; right now, qjackctl simply claims to know how to start the JACK
&gt; server, offers a dialog to let the user pick settings, and then
&gt; constructs a set of command line arguments for jackd.
&gt;
&gt; this will continue to work forever, but it is less flexible than we
&gt; would like (consider what happens every time JACK gets a new option
&gt; added (or taken away). the control API allows a control application to
&gt; query the jack server (actually, its really querying the library that
&gt; contains the implementation of the jack server that the control app is
&gt; linked with), and discover what the available parameters are etc. etc.
&gt;
&gt; the dbus stuff is really mostly orthogonal to this (i stress the
&gt; "mostly")  - its just another example of a control app/system. there's
&gt; no reason why qjackctl would or should want to interact with it.
&gt;
&gt; however, the one area where these things overlap is "auto-start". this
&gt; is because what it means to "auto-start" a JACK server differs in the
&gt; following two scenarios:
&gt;
&gt;     * vanilla JACK install - there is no "jack control" system in
&gt; place or in use
&gt;     * with jackdbus - there is a daemon in place listening for
&gt; requests to start/stop/reconfigure the server
&gt;
&gt; in the first scenario, the ~/.jackdrc file (if it exists) takes care
&gt; of auto-start. but if jackdbus is in use, then auto-start means
&gt; something really quite different.
&gt;
&gt; we are are discussing ways to reconcile these differences on IRC.
&gt;
&gt; for those who don't understand why the second scenario is worth
&gt; considering, i would point to the questions that (relatively)
&gt; frequently come from users about changing a running JACK system to use
&gt; another h/w interface, or to start/stop JACK temporarily for some
&gt; reason. there is one school of opinion that would say that "stop jackd
&gt; and restart it with the correct parameters" is the correct approach to
&gt; this question. i think that at LAC2008 it was felt that we could do
&gt; better.

I confirm this it true (except about LAC2008 because i was not there and
i dont know). And i want to add that qjackctl can be made more flexible
if it can detect jackdbus.
