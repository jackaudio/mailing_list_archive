as far as we can tell, this is true *only* for the auto-start
situation, and that is because of the substantive difference that i
outlined in a previous message about what "auto-start" means in two
different run-time environments. and it showed up for you, as best as
can be determined, because of packaging/build issues that we hope have
been fixed.

everyone involved (i think) agrees that the current way this has to
come to be (a dbus-specific version of libjack) is not the right
solution. we are discussing ways to fix this on #jack at present.
