&gt;&gt; It is not intercepted. It is implemented. No hooking is made.
&gt;&gt; jack_client_open() action is not modified. It behaves as expected, as
&gt;&gt; documented in the API. jack server is autostarted.
&gt;
&gt; It's not just a different implementation. It has side effects
&gt; that the original call does not have (starting a daemon),
&gt; and these side effects will have consequences later.
&gt;
&gt; If this is not true then the new implementation is
&gt; actually  useless.
&gt;
&gt; I would have no objection if you added e.g.
&gt;
&gt;    jack_client_open_via_dbus()
&gt;
&gt; leaving the original call as it is.

No and no again. jack clients dont care how jack server is started. they
want it started so they can use it. period. they dont care about jack
internal infrastructure. The whole point of abstrctions is to allow
changing the implementation. As it is with jack1 and jack2.

Why you dont want jack_client_open_jackdmp() ?

&gt; Someone sets up a firm that provides a free service:
&gt; they enhance your life by removing things from your
&gt; home and disposing of them.
&gt;
&gt; One day I return home and find some things have been
&gt; removed.
&gt;
&gt; I go the manager of the free service and tell him:
&gt;
&gt; - Listen, I don't want you to enter my home and 
&gt;   remove things uninvited.
&gt;
&gt; - But then I can't do my job !
&gt;
&gt; - So you are thieves ?
&gt;
&gt; - No, no, no, we just provide a free service
&gt;   that enhances your life.

This is a BS, nobody is forcing you to use that. You have the free
will. You can choose what to use. There is an option that you dont
like. And nobody is telling you that it will enhance *your* life. It may
enahnce my life. Or someone else's. But not yours. This is why it is
optional. Even installing jack2 instead of jack1 is optional. You are
free to use VAX if you like it. Nobody is forcing you to use something
else.
