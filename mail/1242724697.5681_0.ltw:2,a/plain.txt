No and no again. jack clients dont care how jack server is started. they
want it started so they can use it. period. they dont care about jack
internal infrastructure. The whole point of abstrctions is to allow
changing the implementation. As it is with jack1 and jack2.

Why you dont want jack_client_open_jackdmp() ?

This is a BS, nobody is forcing you to use that. You have the free
will. You can choose what to use. There is an option that you dont
like. And nobody is telling you that it will enhance *your* life. It may
enahnce my life. Or someone else's. But not yours. This is why it is
optional. Even installing jack2 instead of jack1 is optional. You are
free to use VAX if you like it. Nobody is forcing you to use something
else.
