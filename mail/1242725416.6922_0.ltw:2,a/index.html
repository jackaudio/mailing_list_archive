&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; After hours of discussion on #jack IRC, it seems that we are in a
&gt; completely blocked situation:
&gt;
&gt; 1) we currently have 2 "incarnations" of the jack server named "jackd"
&gt; and "jackdbus". "jackd" is the legacy  "classic" version of the server that
&gt; interact with the ~/jackdrc setting file. This setting file may be written
&gt; by Qjackctl or Ardour. "jackdbus" is the new D-Bus aware version of the
&gt; server, it use a completely new setting management system using a
&gt; "conf.xml" file. Il may use a multi-setting system in
&gt; the future.
&gt;
&gt; 2) the *heart" of the problem Fons initially told about is in the way
&gt; applications "auto-start" the server. This launching strategy is part of
&gt; libjack and depends of the incarnation of the server (jackd of jackdbus)
&gt; that is supposed to be used. Right now this strategy is chosen at *compile
&gt; time*, so that in "classic" mode the "jackd" server will be launched using
&gt; a fork-exec strategy, or in D-Bus mode the "jackdbus" server will be
&gt; launched by issuing a D-Bus call.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Since the "auto-start" strategy is chosen at compile time and thus
&gt; is coded in libjack, users will typically encounter all sort of problems as
&gt; soon as the used applications interact with a "D-Bus based strategy"
&gt; libjack (that will launch "jackdbus" incarnation) and users still use
&gt; Qjackctl that interact with the "jackd" incarnation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 4) Different ideas have been proposed  to merge the 2 "jackd" and
&gt; "jackdbus" incarnations in a unique extended "jackd" exe, but nothing
&gt; really clear emerged.
&gt;
&gt; 4) A possible proposed solution was to define 2 completely separated
&gt; packages for jack2 : the "classic" one would package the "jackd"
&gt; incarnation and allow Qjackctl and legacy control applications to be used
&gt; with it. The "D-Bus" one would package the "jackdbus" incarnation, and
&gt; provide D-Bus bas control applications (patchage, ladi tools....). The
&gt; problem of this strategy is that..., it is a kind of complete failure
&gt; regarding the way jack is supposed to be distributed. It may even get
&gt; worse if a new "jackosc" incarnation (a one that would allow to control
&gt; the server using OSC) appears a some point in the future...
&gt;
&gt; 5) Another idea would be improve the "choice of auto-start strategy"
&gt; by providing a runtime choice for that:  a way for the user to select
&gt; between the "classic", "D-Bus", "OSC", strategy once globally for a given
&gt; working session...
&gt;
&gt; 5) Another idea would be be to completely drops the "auto-start"
&gt; strategy...This way we don't have multiple strategy anymore, and solve
&gt; most of the problems... but loose a feature.
&gt;
&gt; Comments?
&gt;

(there are two 5)'s above but i'll refer to the first one)

i vote for the 5) auto-start strategy. user selects which one he/she
prefers. the default should be "classic" and i would add fallback to
"d-bus" and/or "osc" whatever. i still fail to see the problem of honoring
.jackdrc if it exists on your home directory. ie. if .jackdrc exists then
do the "classic" auto-start; if not, check d-bus service; etc.
