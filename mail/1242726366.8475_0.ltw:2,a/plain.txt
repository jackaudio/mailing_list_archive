I was against mixed jack1/jack2 and i'm against the runtime choice
now. IMHO it complicates things for user instead of simplifying it.
It also complicates codebase and I think we can spend our efforts with
something else instead. Still, if someone has the motivation to do
runtime choice of auto-strategy - fine, i can live with it. The only
important thing is that with jackdbus the default strategy must be
autostarting through dbus. If it is not, by default jackdbus control apps
will not work with jackdbus. Such setup will be pretty useless, eh?
