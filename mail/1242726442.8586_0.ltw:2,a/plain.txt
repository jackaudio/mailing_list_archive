And we will all agree that this would be a packaging disaster. I package
jack for gentoo pro-audio, and I really don't know how I'd handle this one.

To me, this one is the cleanest of all, and would allow to keep auto-start
for those who like it with the flavor of their choice (and eventually
disable it for those who don't ?)

Last resort but if it comes down to this, I can handle my idea of
auto-start directly inside LADITools using dbus calls. although it wouldn't
be as good as the "any client can auto-start jack" paradigm.
