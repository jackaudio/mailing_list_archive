It seems you really don't want to see that using this  
"jack_client_open does a fork+exec call to launch jackd with the ./ 
jackdrc file" has been completely *hard coded* in libjack from day  
one!  And is a really strong constraint for any possible new way of  
controlling the server.

The discussion is now: do we keep this "hard coded thing in libjack"  
or do we try to relax it a bit ?
