qjackctl can already opt to not write any .jackdrc. ardour may vary. i
would assume it to use the jack control api in a near future. the same
would apply to qjackctl. then everybody will be happy again ;)

i was asking for a default strategy, call it "auto", which will try
"classic" first, then "d-bus", then whatever.

the main question, at least in my mind, is all about *which* settings will
be used to auto-start the server, isn't it? an explicit command line, as
in "classic", should *always* take precedence over the settings in any
internal configuration database, which i think the "d-bus" honors instead
and that latter behavior is being the root of all "d-bus" evil. scnrt ;)
