My feeling is that is we choose the runtime auto-start strategy, then  
we should not mix anything concerting setting management. Each  
"incarnation" of server has it's own view of setting management and  
this has to stay completely separated from any other view. If the used  
chose "classic" auto-start strategy (that would stay the default yes)  
then he is supposed to know that he has to use "classic" control tools  
(Qjackctl..). If the user chose  "D-Bus" auto-start strategy, then he  
knows he has to use D-Bus aware control tools only and so on...
