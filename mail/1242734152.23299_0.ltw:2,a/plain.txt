So, when the classic jackd is running and you do a ps ax | grep jack what do 
you see?

And when the new jackdbus is running and you do a ps ax | grep jack what do 
you see?

I don't think anyone has yet stipulated that this must be a compile time 
option and not a run time config file option. Must it be a compile time 
option?

What would happen if the jackdbus incarnation checked for an rc file on launch 
and, if it found one, rewrote its own xml file to match before proceeding 
with startup. Then on each change of its own xml file, it could rewrite the 
rc file. Would that give a quick and dirty fix to this issue until a better 
solution is found?

What are the problems with this idea? For packages made by one person and 
installed by others, aren't runtime choices better and more flexible than 
compile time choices? (Generally...)

I think we may not have paid enough attention to what others have been saying 
in this thread. Myself included. And perhaps this has *"extended"* the 
discussion.
