I'm not forcing the new paradigm to anybody. I dont want to force and i
cant force because i dont maintain neither jack1 nor jack2. jackdbus was
optional and alternative from day zero. it was configure option in the
very first dbus.patch that was against jack1 codebase. Packagers force
users. Or users force themself. Developers create software. They may
give advice but they dont deploy to end user. At least in open source
world.
