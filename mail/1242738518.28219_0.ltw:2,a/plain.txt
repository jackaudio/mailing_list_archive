While this may work in the short term in terms of saving valuable 
resources for other more important tasks I think you already know that 
is in not acceptable in the medium to long term as it will just confuse 
the f out of the "average" user requiring them to know the difference 
between the competing standards. Tooltips might help here but there are 
plenty who don't know how to read a tooltip also.

However if the goal is to have this problem completely fixed and 
transparent before the average user is expected to use the system then 
proceed as outlined above as it is reasonable from an end user pov to 
set limits as such in the short term.
