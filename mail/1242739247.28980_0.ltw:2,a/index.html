&gt; &gt;&gt; So you complain about qjackctl missing support for jackdbus? Having that
&gt; &gt;&gt; will be nice :)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; from where i stand, qjackctl does not need jackdbus support whatsoever.
&gt; &gt; it's kind of the other way around, if i may say. and the way around is not
&gt; &gt; about qjackctl per se, but to plain old good command-line jackd.
&gt; 
&gt; In jackdbus system qjackctl is unusable for starting and configuring the
&gt; jack server (there is no jackd executable). However qjackctl can still
&gt; be used to monitor xruns and DSP load and as a patchbay application.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; fwiw, qjackctl just runs the jackd server as documented and interfaces to
&gt; &gt; libjack through its plain client api. it has been doing this for years and
&gt; &gt; rightly so, imo.
&gt; 
&gt; Yup I know that. And this is why it works as patchbay and monitor app
&gt; when used with jackdbus.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; however, by having jackdbus in the picture and when everybody would think
&gt; &gt; it would be the holy grail, it is breaking all that instead just because
&gt; &gt; it wants to rule the game on its own. it's doing it with complete
&gt; &gt; disregard to what long time qjackctl/jackd users have been thought. that's
&gt; &gt; disgraceful to say the least.
&gt; 
&gt; It is not breaking it is fixing issues. Or I'm wrong that qjackctl can't
&gt; show messages generated by jackd when jackd is autolaunched by regular
&gt; jack client application? Last time I checked those messages go to
&gt; application's stdout (that is inherited from the parent process - the
&gt; one of the normal jack client application).
&gt; 
&gt; The issue that started this holy war is that dbus enabled package that
&gt; contains also jackd got into the hands of Fons and ate his babies. The
&gt; problem is already fixed in svn. qjackctl will not work when dbus is
&gt; enabled unless both jackdbus and jackd are compiled and installed and
&gt; after the packager ignores the warning text at configure time. qjackctl
&gt; will not work because there will be not jackd executable installed.

and why is this sooooooooo complicated ? 
why not think a bit about legacy ?
this "i dont care for legacy" attitude is the problem. and it does not
help to say we think "dbus eats babies". this is just a cheap excuse.

we are pissed because you dont care.
and i am starting to care less and less for all this shit too.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i strongly believe that all this trouble is a matter or something that
&gt; &gt; just has been overlooked on the jackdbus development, that is, a
&gt; &gt; misinterpretation, a bug that can be squashed right away once it's
&gt; &gt; perfectly identified.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless you point to what is wrong nobody who knows how jackdbus system
&gt; operates will understand what you mean.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; however, if all that is due on a jackdbus design decision instead, then i
&gt; &gt; am sorry, i'll digress. a completely new qjackctl has to be written from
&gt; &gt; the ground up. just don't ask me to do it, at least anytime soon :)
&gt; 
&gt; I asked you to add support for jackdbus (there are qt dbus wrappers)
&gt; more than a year ago. It was in December 2007 IIRC. Not that I hoped a
&gt; lot even back then.
