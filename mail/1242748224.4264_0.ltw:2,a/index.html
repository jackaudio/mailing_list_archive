&gt; - No, no, no, we just provide a free service

I have to say, I think this is really out of line, Fons.  Implying free
software developers are theives because they've changed something and
you don't like it is quite extraordinary.

I think a better analogy would be like so:


Someone sets up a firm that provides and maintains free furniture,
appliances, plumbing and electricity for anybody's home.

One day, you come home and find half of your radiators don't work
because someone has started upgrading the plumbing and hasn't finished
yet.

You go to the manager of the free service and tell him:

- Listen, I don't want you to stop the radiators in my house from
  working.

- That's fine, you're entirely free to install your own plumbing, or fix
  the plumbing we've installed for you.

- I don't want to, you should do it for me and do it right dammit!
