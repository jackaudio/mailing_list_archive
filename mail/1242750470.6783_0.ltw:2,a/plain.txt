Even better:

Someone sets up a firm Foo that produces furniture,
appliances, plumbing, etc.

Someone sets up a firm Bar that provides and maintains free furniture,
appliances, plumbing and electricity for anybody's home by using the
prducts of firm Foo.

One day, you come home and find half of your radiators don't work
because someone has started upgrading the plumbing and hasn't finished
yet.

You go to the manager of the firm Foo and tell him:

- Listen, I don't want you to stop the radiators in my house from
  working.

- I don't. I have no control with out. Why you dont ask the manager of
  firm Bar?

- But you produce it!

- Yes, we produce toxic waste too. There are bacteria that eat it. I'm
  affraid the manager of firm Bar got impression that you eat toxic
  waste too. I'm sorry about situation. We will improve instructions
  about our toxic waste product but still, you have to request Bar to
  meet your requirements. Or stop using Bar and use Baz instead.
