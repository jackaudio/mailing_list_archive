Watching the jam for free, you can learn a lot, but you don't get the 
music you might wish to get, you need to go to the concert for free or 
you need to download the recording for free AND the band can produce 
different new versions, but it should be possible to hear the first 
version of the concert in the future ... metaphors won't work ;).
