The latest version of the Atari Cubase still can run sessions of the 
first version, sometimes you can't do this with Rosegarden between two 
versions (okay, I nearly does NO RT-AUDIO with Linux ;)). But the point 
isn't what is possible or impossible for other OS's. For Windows and Mac 
you can get the same open source applications, but not everybody want to 
work with the source code and set up the application by this way, most 
people needs a working tool.
