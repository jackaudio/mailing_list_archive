When KF explained it further, the impression I got was that you would have:

     /usr/lib/jack-x.y.z/jackd
     /usr/lib/jacdmp-q.r.s/jackd

And then this:

     /usr/bin/jackd --> is a link to /whichever/one/root/has/picked

Examples of this include Qt3/Qt4 install practices, and the Debian 
'alternatives' system.
