You get me wrong.

&gt; I find it hard to see how you actually understand Linux audio. I get 
&gt; the impression that you have almost tried but instead have 
&gt; persistently trolled on this point since you arrived.
&gt;
&gt; The above is a "full stop" of Ralfs dialog, I say this just in case 
&gt; there is a possible alternative that seems to make sense for a 
&gt; temporary period.
&gt;
&gt; Ralf.
&gt;
&gt; Please stop with your destabilising crap.
&gt;
&gt; - For reference : This must be the 50th time Ralf has been asked to 
&gt; stop dissing Linux Audio...
&gt;
&gt; Eventually someone from the mass media will see through his bs (and M$ 
&gt; fud). Until that time we are at his merciful prerogative to make Linux 
&gt; audio look like he and his cronies give a shit.  I have to wonder tho, 
&gt; That if he is prepared to  spend this much time dissing Linux audio, 
&gt; then his boosses must be really scared about the results as they are 
&gt; obviously well aware of how close we are to the existing sytem that 
&gt; has been devised by  the "Geniuses" at ...(insert your favorite sound 
&gt; system here)
&gt; Ralf. I would really love to hear a conclusive rebuttal from you.. 
&gt; After four years. (is it really that long?)  I  think we are owed a 
&gt; conclusive response.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have to say, I think this is really out of line, Fons.  Implying 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; free
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; software developers are theives because they've changed something and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you don't like it is quite extraordinary.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;               
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I did not imply such a thing. You are completely missing the point.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;           
&gt;&gt;&gt; Such is the danger of analogies.  What was the point?
&gt;&gt;&gt;       
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Running gag: Metaphors don't work :D.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I wish you all get your views reconciled. Tonight I'll try to make 
&gt;&gt; music with Linux again (by using jack).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good luck to you, good luck to myself,
