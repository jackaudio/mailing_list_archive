Indeed.

I might be way off base, but what is wrong with the old school approach
to changing daemons settings by getting it to re read a config file on
SIGUSR1?

Handle stdout by providing a couple of arguments that specify where
to write the output (Think named pipes setup by whatever control
interface cares). 

Dbus & XML for what should be a minimal system daemon running with RT
priority? WTF? 

I have some reasonably mission critical things going on with jackd, the
last thing I need on those boxes (one of which does not even have an X
server) is integration with the desktop. 

Regards, Dan.
