&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; New much simplified proposal, should be "Fons compatible", hopefully
&gt; "Nedko compatible" (with little work), "Paul one package only
&gt; compatible", others "keep it simple compatible"...
&gt;
&gt; The first "big" conceptual change compared to the current SVN state is
&gt; this new "control IPC" scheme. That is the so called control API can be
&gt; used on client side also. The other conceptual change is that "jackd"
&gt; process is supposed to be an "always running" daemon that defines an IPC
&gt; entry point to be used from "clients". This daemon does not
&gt; "automatically" starts the server (as it does now), but will  when
&gt; requested (either by the "jackd" code directly using C API ) or by the
&gt; request of external control font-end using IPC.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 1) Server side:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - libjackserver.so contains:  server code + C control API  + "new" IPC
&gt; control API (server side) +  C Jack API  + IPC Jack API (server side)
&gt;
&gt; - jackd executable is linked with libjackserver.so  (nothing new here)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - backends (ALSA, dummy...) are linked with libjackserver.so  (nothing
&gt; new here)
&gt;
&gt; - a "standalone" client (that wants to embed the server in it's
&gt; process) is linked with libjackserver.so and directly uses the C control
&gt; API  to control/start the server and C Jack API to be a client
&gt; (nothing new here).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 2) Client side:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - libjack.so contains :  "new" IPC control API (client side) + IPC
&gt; Jack API (client side)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - clients are linked to libjack.so (nothing new here)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - new control front-end (jackdbus, jackOSC...) are linked to
&gt; libjack.so: they control the server using the IPC control API (client
&gt; side), they can be regular clients using IPC Jack API (client side) to deal
&gt; with connections management and so on...
&gt;
&gt; - a "default" centralized state for the server is always kept in ~/
&gt; jackdrc. When a client wants to auto-start, this "default" state is used.
&gt; (this is important to keep in mind)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - libjack may have to start the "jackd" executable using the fork+exec
&gt; way, or the "jackd" process is an "always running + relaunch" process (this
&gt; has to be more defined later on...)
&gt;
&gt; - Qjakctl stays as a regular client, it can still start the "jackd"
&gt; process as usual. It can keep its own way of keeping multiple
&gt; configurations as it does now.
&gt;
&gt; - more sophisticated control front-end (jackdbus, jackOSC...) are now
&gt; regular clients. They can use the IPC control API (client side) for more
&gt; sophisticated control of the server. As regular clients, they access the
&gt; API to control connections... and so on. The important
&gt; thing is that those clients are *obliged* to deal with this "default"
&gt; centralized state. Even if they deal with multiple configs in a new format
&gt; (XML...) they are supposed to always put a "default" state in
&gt; ~/jackdrc for the client "auto-start"  feature to continue working.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - Ardour can still do it's server control mess on its own... ((-:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 3) General:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - a single jack2 package is needed. It contains the "jackd" daemon/
&gt; server are before.
&gt;
&gt; - "jackdbus" is now conceptually separated from the Jack source code.
&gt; It only uses jack.h + control.h and is linked to libjack.so as any
&gt; regular client. It can be distributed separately as a more sophisticated
&gt; control front-end available, or be available in the jack2 package.
&gt;
&gt; - old fashion users can keep their habits
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - new "D-Bus aware" guys can explore new fields...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This scheme seems to hopefully solve most of the problems we had, and
&gt; requires only a bit of change for the "jackdbus" front-end to continue
&gt; working, but not much.
&gt;

St&#xE9;phane, you're a champion hero!
