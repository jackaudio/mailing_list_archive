One obvious problem is that it will be necessary to create yet another
IPC protocol for control communication between libjack.so and
libjackserver.so. Why not use something already proven and with existing
tools like call monitor, command line interface etc. - that's why D-Bus
was used in first place.

Don't we already have too much NIH?

Oh well, maybe not ;)
