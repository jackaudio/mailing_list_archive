&gt;
&gt; Okay.
&gt;
&gt; Then, if you're keeping the "fork and exec" method of starting the
&gt; server, will it in any way be guaranteed than all control clients will
&gt; have the same functionality as the client which initially started  
&gt; jackd?

Why not?
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise, starting a single client will prevent any control  
&gt; application
&gt; started later from being able to do its job.

In what way?

&gt; In non-DBUS JACK the
&gt; application that started jackd had a monopoly on access to its
&gt; stdout/stderr.

Not clear for me.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Also, what if the application that did fork and exec crashes?

Same behaviour as now, the server detects crashed client and stops if  
started in "temporary" (-T mode)
or continue to run if started non temporary.

&gt; What if
&gt; the server crashes?

As usual, client can detect that using the "shutdown" callback.

&gt; What if both crash, but other control applications
&gt; are still running?

  "shutdown" callback.

&gt; I think that in any correct solution, the fact that
&gt; an application has started jackd shouldn't give it any more (or less)
&gt; influence on jackd than any other client in the system - otherwise  
&gt; it is
&gt; a race condition. The hypothetical new version of qjackctl should have
&gt; the same feature set no matter if it was started before or after, say,
&gt; Hydrogen.
&gt;
&gt; Can the same IPC protocol you plan to use for the control protocol be
&gt; reused for the out-of-band MIDI SysEx data? (we've been talking about
&gt; that before, and it's really out of scope of control protocol
&gt; discussion, but it might be useful at some point).
&gt;

No idea right now. I think we should focus on the global design.
