Subject:     [LAD] New proposal for the jackd/jackdbus mess : adding "config" API

Hi all,

Here is an updated version that add a new (to be defined) "config" API  
in libjack.so. The idea is to provide a way to *share* multiple server  
configurations in a unique place for all control application. The  
important point are:

- we are not allowed to break legacy use of ~/.jackdrc

- we absolutely want to maintain server auto-start from clients

So the overall suggestion is to *maintain* this ~/.jackdrc  with it's  
current format and to define a new config API that will probably use  
another file (or set of files...).

- legacy control application (Qjackcl for instance) can still use  
their multiple server configurations, they will not see and use this  
new share and centralized state, but I don't think we can do better.

- new control front-end (jackdbus, jackOSC) would have to use this   
new config API.

Comments?
