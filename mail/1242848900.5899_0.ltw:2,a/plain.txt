You don't need this jackd. If all the IPC is in libjack, an
autostart request can be passed directly to jackcontrol without
creating a transient process.

1. Client uses jack_client_open() with autostart.
2. Libjack doesn't find the server
3. Libjack sends 'start server' to jackcontrol
4. jackcontrol starts the server
5. jackcontrol notifies libjack
6. The jack_client_open() call proceeds.

Between 3 and 5 the thread doing the original call
(i.e. the client's thread) just waits within libjack
for the ok/fail message from jackcontrol.
