The fork/exec is done by jackcontrol, if it fails then
jackcontrol reports this and the entire jack_client_open()
is made to fail. A timeout is required to cover the case
that jackcontrol isn't there (but that can be tested before
the start server request), or it crashes doing the fork/exec,
but in the latter case there are bigger problems anyway.
