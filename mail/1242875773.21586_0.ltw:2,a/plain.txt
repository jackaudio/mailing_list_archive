Yes, that's the way one would like it to work.  But the real situation
is a bit more complicated (see the start_server function in
libjack/client.c).

First, note that since exec() is called in the child process, there is
no failure code returned in the parent (i.e. client) process address
space.  Second, there are actually two fork() calls.  That ensures
that any zombie proc structure created on exit from jackd will
automatically be cleaned up by the init process.  That avoids
depending on the client to call wait(), which it would not know it
needed to do.
