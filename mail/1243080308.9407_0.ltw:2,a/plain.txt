Subject:     Re: [LAD] [ANN] guitarix-0.04.4-1 release

discussion started at LAD about changing the jack server latency from the app called guitarix (like ardour does from its menu JACK -> Latency). Proposed guitarix patch (by me) works nice against jack2 but not against jack1. See below.

Hermann,

I quickly ran guitarix in debug mode through gdb. You get a crash at dsp_audio.cpp, line 469. Looks like memory at output[2] and output[3] cannot be accessed. I tried to understand what you attempt to do but this function (mydsp::compute) is way to much for me to understand. It looks like some sort of auto-code ...

Anyway, output[2] and output[3] are passed in from process() (process callback function). I believe these arrays should correspond to buffers that you receive from jack audio ports 2 and 3. However, at the time we try to change the latency, they are already unregistered because of DSP.setNumOutputs().

So it looks to me that resetting the jack buffer size on the fly from guitarix badly interacts with how jack1 handled your port deregistration requests. I don't know why it works with jack2. Running guitarix through gdb against jack2, I could see that output[2] and output[3] were still valid memory locations after changing the jack buffer size on the fly. 
  
This is a bit unfortunate that we get different behaviors when using jack1 or jack2. I hope you'll sort it out, I don't have more time to spend on it. 

J.

PS: by the way, be careful with hardcoded values. On one hand you have gNumOutChans (= 4), on the other you have arrays declared with [4].
