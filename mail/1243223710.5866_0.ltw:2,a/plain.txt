(sorry for the delay, I just got back from a couple of weeks of no
internet access). 

Yes, obviously you are not installing from a "reputable" distro. Sigh. I
shall rebuild and disable dbus, I thought at the time I built 1.9.2 it
would be an interesting option and did not realize all the problems it
could/would cause. Argh/sorry.  

I have at the moment still 314 (pi??) more messages marked unread on the
jack list folder in my mail client so most probably this has been hashed
to death already...

Is there a way to disable the dbus functionality if jackmp is compiled
with it? ("jack_control exit"?) I'm far from understanding the whole
thing in detail...
