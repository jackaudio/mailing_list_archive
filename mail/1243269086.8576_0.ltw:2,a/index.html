&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I would be happy to get some reactions of this proposal that tries to  
&gt; keep the "guardians" and the "rebels" on the same boat. The pdf file  
&gt; for this proposal is : http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jackcontrol2.pdf.  
&gt; Compared to latest Fons proposal, this proposal basically combine the  
&gt; "control daemon" and the "jackd" server in a *unique* extended jackd  
&gt; (with control API IPC) (see 5). It also tries to minimize the number  
&gt; of shared libraries in the system, although we may decide to break-up  
&gt; the code in separated libraries if this is really needed (see 3).  
&gt; Concerning Torben proposal to have "control plug-ins" be part of the  
&gt; server, I agree with Fons here: this would be quite limited and more  
&gt; complex:  a new interface would have to be defined, "who" is loading  
&gt; those plug-ins in the server... and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me explain it again:
&gt; 
&gt; The first "big" conceptual change compared to the current SVN state is  
&gt; this new "control IPC" scheme. That is the so called control API can  
&gt; be used on client side also. The other point is this concept of "multi- 
&gt; config share state" (see 3).
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Server side:
&gt; 
&gt; - libjackserver.so contains: server code + C control API  + "new" IPC  
&gt; control API (server side) +  C Jack API  + IPC Jack API (server side)
&gt; 
&gt; - jackd executable is linked with libjackserver.so  (nothing new here)
&gt; 
&gt; - backends (ALSA, dummy...) are linked with libjackserver.so  (nothing  
&gt; new here)
&gt; 
&gt; - a "standalone" client (that wants to embed the server in it's  
&gt; process) is linked with libjackserver.so and directly uses the C  
&gt; control API  to control/start the server and C Jack API to be a client  
&gt; (nothing new here).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Client side:
&gt; 
&gt; - libjack.so contains :  "new" IPC control API (client side) + IPC  
&gt; Jack API (client side) + config API (TO BE DEFINED)
&gt; 
&gt; - clients are linked to libjack.so (nothing new here)
&gt; 
&gt; - new control front-end (jackdbus, jackOSC...) are linked to  
&gt; libjack.so: they control the server using the IPC control API (client  
&gt; side), they can be regular clients using IPC Jack API (client side) to  
&gt; deal with connections management and so on...
&gt; 
&gt; - a "default" centralized state for the server is always kept in ~/ 
&gt; jackdrc. When a client wants to auto-start, this "default" state is  
&gt; used. (this is important to keep in mind)
&gt; 
&gt; - libjack may have to start the "jackd" executable using the fork+exec  
&gt; way, or the "jackd" process is an "always running + relaunch" process  
&gt; (this has to be more defined later on...)
&gt; 
&gt; - Qjakctl stays as a regular client, it can still start the "jackd"  
&gt; process as usual. It can keep its own way of keeping multiple  
&gt; configurations as it does now.
&gt; 
&gt; - more sophisticated control front-end (jackdbus, jackOSC...) are now  
&gt; regular clients. They can use the IPC control API (client side) for  
&gt; more sophisticated control of the server. As regular clients, they  
&gt; access the API to control connections... and so on. The important  
&gt; thing is that those clients are *obliged* to deal with this "default"  
&gt; centralized state.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Centralized multi-settings share state
&gt; 
&gt; - the idea is to provide a way to *share* multiple server  
&gt; configurations in a unique place for all control applications. This is  
&gt; part the D-Bus proposal in some sense. WE HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE WANT  
&gt; THIS FEATURE BE PART OF JACK OR NOT (this can be coded as part of  
&gt; libjack.so or in a separated library called "libjackconfig.so" is we  
&gt; need to share this code between the sever and client side).
&gt; 
&gt; - If we don't share a unique state, then any control application  
&gt; (jackdbus or any other in the future) will have the choice to use any  
&gt; format (XML...) but then obviously we loose the fact that all control  
&gt; applications would always see the same settings.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 4) General:
&gt; 
&gt; - a single jack2 package is needed. It contains the "jackd" daemon/ 
&gt; server as before.
&gt; 
&gt; - "jackdbus" is now conceptually separated from the Jack source code.  
&gt; It only uses jack.h + control.h + config.h (??) and is linked to  
&gt; libjack.so as any regular client. It can be distributed separately as  
&gt; a more sophisticated control front-end available, or be available in  
&gt; the jack2 package.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 5) Points of discussion:
&gt; 
&gt; - this model is somewhat simplified compared to the latest Fons  
&gt; proposal (a daemon process + [possibly] several separated jackd  
&gt; servers). The point is that separated processes for control daemon and  
&gt; jackd servers would need another mechanism for "control daemon" &lt;===&gt;   
&gt; jackd server communications (that is: the control daemon launches the  
&gt; jackd server, but then has to control it while it is running, possibly  
&gt; get some info from it (notifications.. etc..)).  If we stay with a  
&gt; unique "extended jackd" (with control API IPC), then things are a lot  
&gt; simpler. We can consider that having a single running jackd server is  
&gt; a common case and having several running jackd server a "corner case".  
&gt; It we decide that several running jackd servers is really necessary,  
&gt; then the "extended jackd" can still handle the situation if we accept  
&gt; to have several jackd servers running in a same process. Otherwise a  
&gt; more complex model for "completely separated control daemon and  
&gt; several jackd servers" has to be defined.
&gt; 
&gt; - multi-config stare state: is this part of Jack or not?
&gt; 
&gt; - if  multi-config share state is part of Jack, then a new API to  
&gt; handle that has to be defined
&gt; 
&gt; - when proposing new things, please keep in mind that jack2 is now  
&gt; multi-platform... don't be too Linux focused.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments welcome!

&gt; 

Not that much related, but as I'm reading this comes to my mind:
For this app you need jackOSC, for that app you need jackDBUS, for the
other app you need jack* ....
I hope these control-applications will be compatible with each other and
don't interfere.
