The proposed scheme does not go (yet) into details of what happens if  
different control applications are used at the same time. We may  
choose to have a unique one running at a time, or allows several to  
access/control the server at the same (in this case we would have to  
deal with state notifications issues and so on...). One related  
question is the "multi-config" shared state. If we consider the "multi- 
config" shared state to be part of JACK, then this state would stay  
"coherent" between invocations of successives (possibly different)  
control applications (jackDBUS, jackOSC). If we don't choose this  
option, then each control application would probably handle "it's view  
of multi-config management". (note this is currently the case with  
Qjackctl...).

I think we should go step by step, first try to explain and agree on a  
general scheme, then precise some missing details.
