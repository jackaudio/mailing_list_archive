&gt; &gt; Note that we may remove the "jackcontrol + jackserver" separation by

&gt; 
&gt; Having a permanent jackd - a real daemon started as a

I would agree (sorry for the late response). Dbus _is_ actually a
server, and an external one that does not have anything to do with jack.
It is just convenient, but the assumption that it will always be there
is flawed.

&gt; You talk to it via libjack using the mechanisms already
&gt; present in jack - sockets and shared memory. It is this
&gt; jackd that will start a server, either requested explicitly
&gt; by a control client, or as the result of a jack client
&gt; using jack_client_open() to a nonexistant server. The 
&gt; latter is detected by jackd via the normal libjack
&gt; paths.
&gt; 
&gt; Servers should probably be separate processes (so they
&gt; can be owned by a user).
&gt; 
&gt; For those that want it this jackd can have a dbus control
&gt; client, which could also be a daemon but this time started
&gt; probably from the login scripts. 
&gt; 
&gt; What is gained is that there is ***no dbus inside jack***
&gt; It is this idea of using dbus for internal communication
&gt; that I find utterly revolting. It creates a dependency
&gt; on dbus (which is unnecessary) and on a session login
&gt; (which is limiting its use), and it opens the gates for
&gt; all sorts of sick desktop-zealot inspired persistence
&gt; and stability risks.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also just bad design, comparable to using a $3000
&gt; precision programmable voltage source in a circuit where
&gt; a 10 cent zener diode would do. Or replacing a fixed 
&gt; cable by a switch matrix. Or talking to your wife via
&gt; a lawyer.
