Hi :)

sorry, I'm a fan of Qtractor, but it's still on a state were bugs 
urgently should be reported and wishes might have more effect than for 
similar, but established applications.

I send 3 mails to [hidden], but I got 'Could not deliver the 
message in the time limit specified.'

I also wasn't able to surf http://www.rncbc.org/, the strange thing is, 
that I don't get an error message.

I know that he's subscribed to Jack-dev and LAD.

Is anybody able to connect to http://www.rncbc.org/?

Some time ago there was a similar problem with his domain. I fear I can 
imagine what the problem is :(.

Best,
Ralf

PS: Now I got "The server at www.rncbc.org is taking too long to respond."
