I'm sorry :)

I targeted to write a better report, my mails are a little bit 
confusing. If you want to take a look right now to this confusing 
reports, here  is the link:

http://lists.64studio.com/pipermail/64studio-users/2009-May/003027.html

There are two post script mails as 'next messages'.

I also wrote two messages because of rtirq.sh and the handling of the 
script for 64 Studio, but they didn't came through the list until now.

Today I had a rest and maybe tomorrow I'll make music by using Qtractor, 
but it seems to be, that this is only possible for music done with 
DSSIs, not with external sources like vocals, because of sync trouble.

Thank you for your effort.

Best,
Ralf
