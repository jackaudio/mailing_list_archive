&gt; Hmm,
&gt;
&gt; I was just thinking, when jack2 finished initialization it takes a
&gt; name on the session bus, right?

Not sure about what you mean by " it takes name on the session bus". I  
hope Nedko can answer better here.

What is implemented right now is the acquire/release scheme based on  
your reserver.h,c code. This is done in the ALSA backend.

&gt;
&gt; If that's the case then I could hack up a little module in PA that
&gt; will autoload the JACK connectivity modules as soon as jack becomes
&gt; available. That way we could make the integration between PA and JACK
&gt; a bit closer. Together with the device reservation logic we already
&gt; have in place we could then have out-of-the-box user experience that
&gt; would work like this:
&gt;
&gt; As soon as jack starts up and takes posession of the device, the hw
&gt; device will appear grayed out in pa's volume control, however a new
&gt; virtual device for connectivity with jack appears in the vc. Data
&gt; written to that device will be passed to JACK on a couple of
&gt; ports. It's then up to the user if he wants to make use of those ports
&gt; and connect them inside of jack or just leave them unconnected. (as
&gt; far as I understood the mere existance of a port when it is
&gt; unconnected has no detrimental effect on jack latency behaviour, does
&gt; it?). As soon as JACK terminates the virtual JACK device in PA will go
&gt; away again, and the hw device won't be greyed out anymore.
&gt;
&gt; That way the seperation line between PA clients and JACK clients would
&gt; be blurred a bit.
&gt;
&gt; One could even go a step further and reroute all existing streams from
&gt; the hw device to the virtual jack device, as long as it exists and
&gt; back afterwards. That way starting up jack would have the effect that
&gt; PA's own ALSA backend would simply be temporarily be replaced by
&gt; JACK.
&gt;
&gt; Does that make sense to you?
&gt;
&gt; Lennart

Technically it "could" make sense, but I'm not sure JACK users want  
that as the default behaviour. I would prefer if "real users" in JACK  
and LAD communities could elaborate on that.
