Not sure about what you mean by " it takes name on the session bus". I  
hope Nedko can answer better here.

What is implemented right now is the acquire/release scheme based on  
your reserver.h,c code. This is done in the ALSA backend.

Technically it "could" make sense, but I'm not sure JACK users want  
that as the default behaviour. I would prefer if "real users" in JACK  
and LAD communities could elaborate on that.
