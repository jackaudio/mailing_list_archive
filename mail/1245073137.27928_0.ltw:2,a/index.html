&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just thinking, when jack2 finished initialization it takes a

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not sure about what you mean by " it takes name on the session  
&gt;&gt; bus". I
&gt;&gt; hope Nedko can answer better here.
&gt;
&gt; I simply mean it calls dbus_bus_request_name()
&gt; resp. org.freedesktop.DBus.RequestName to acquire a service name n the
&gt; session bus, such as org.jack.foo.bar.


We recently had a strong debate on JACK dev list about the way DBus  
could/should be used with JACK. DBus is currently used a two different  
places in JACK2:

1) to deal with this "audio device reservation" idea to better  
cooperate with PulseAudio. This is coded in ALSA backend directly (and  
so is used only when ALSA backend is used..)

2) to deal with the so-called "server control API", that is a more  
powerful way to control the server from (DBus) based applications.

What I'm personally trying to achieve is a more "flexible" way  
(compared to what is currently a bit hard-coded in JAKC2 SVN) so that  
a DBus control component can be coded as a "plugin" to be possibly  
loaded in JACK server process. This new plugin model allows to keep  
basically 2 ways of using JACK server :  the "old way" (typically  
starting the jackd server using Qjackctl control application) or the  
new way using DBus based control applications (after the DBus control  
plug-in has been properly loaded in JACK server).  (Keeping the "old- 
way" is also important on others platforms JACK2 runs on.)

If this new "control plugin" model is finally accepted by JACK  
community, then we'll distribute/package JACK2 compiled with the 1)  
option, so that it (at least) cooperates with PulseAudio. But 2) would  
then be optional, so PA can not rely on the DBus control plug-in to  
always be present.

The 1) code uses  "org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.AudioXX" name, and  
2) optional DBus plugin uses "org.jackaudio.service" name. If we want  
to implement your proposal, the we would need to request another name  
in  1) part, is that correct?


&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; As soon as jack starts up and takes posession of the device, the hw
&gt;&gt;&gt; device will appear grayed out in pa's volume control, however a new
&gt;&gt;&gt; virtual device for connectivity with jack appears in the vc. Data
&gt;&gt;&gt; written to that device will be passed to JACK on a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt; ports. It's then up to the user if he wants to make use of those  
&gt;&gt;&gt; ports
&gt;&gt;&gt; and connect them inside of jack or just leave them unconnected. (as
&gt;&gt;&gt; far as I understood the mere existance of a port when it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; unconnected has no detrimental effect on jack latency behaviour,  
&gt;&gt;&gt; does
&gt;&gt;&gt; it?).
&gt;
&gt; Could you say something about this question of mine regarding the mere
&gt; existance of ports in jack please?

Having JACK ports means a PulseAudio client is running. But it does  
not add any "latency" by itself.


&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that make sense to you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lennart
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Technically it "could" make sense, but I'm not sure JACK users want
&gt;&gt; that as the default behaviour. I would prefer if "real users" in JACK
&gt;&gt; and LAD communities could elaborate on that.
&gt;
&gt; I mean, the idea is to simply offer those PA innterconnection ports,
&gt; it's up to the user to connect them or not. And if a user really
&gt; doesn't want that we could even make that easily disabable in the PA
&gt; UI somewhere.
&gt;

Yes, I see.
