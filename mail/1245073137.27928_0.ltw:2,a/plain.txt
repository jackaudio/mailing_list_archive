We recently had a strong debate on JACK dev list about the way DBus  
could/should be used with JACK. DBus is currently used a two different  
places in JACK2:

1) to deal with this "audio device reservation" idea to better  
cooperate with PulseAudio. This is coded in ALSA backend directly (and  
so is used only when ALSA backend is used..)

2) to deal with the so-called "server control API", that is a more  
powerful way to control the server from (DBus) based applications.

What I'm personally trying to achieve is a more "flexible" way  
(compared to what is currently a bit hard-coded in JAKC2 SVN) so that  
a DBus control component can be coded as a "plugin" to be possibly  
loaded in JACK server process. This new plugin model allows to keep  
basically 2 ways of using JACK server :  the "old way" (typically  
starting the jackd server using Qjackctl control application) or the  
new way using DBus based control applications (after the DBus control  
plug-in has been properly loaded in JACK server).  (Keeping the "old- 
way" is also important on others platforms JACK2 runs on.)

If this new "control plugin" model is finally accepted by JACK  
community, then we'll distribute/package JACK2 compiled with the 1)  
option, so that it (at least) cooperates with PulseAudio. But 2) would  
then be optional, so PA can not rely on the DBus control plug-in to  
always be present.

The 1) code uses  "org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.AudioXX" name, and  
2) optional DBus plugin uses "org.jackaudio.service" name. If we want  
to implement your proposal, the we would need to request another name  
in  1) part, is that correct?

Having JACK ports means a PulseAudio client is running. But it does  
not add any "latency" by itself.

Yes, I see.
