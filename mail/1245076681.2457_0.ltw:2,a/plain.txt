Yes, I noticed.

Distributions will certainly enable the D-Bus code in JACK if they
ship it. So, I have no problem with depending on a dbus'ified jack for
this logic to work. After all crazy folks who disable the dbus support
in jack because they think it's an abomination probably think that PA
is an even worse abomination anyway, so there's not need to cater for
them.

I think org.jackaudio.service should be fine. I don't think this
automatic logic needs to work on non-D-Bus jack builds. As I see it
you don't need to make any changes on jack for this to work. All I
need is the guarantee that by the time the service name is registered
on the bus jack is fully accessible. Otherwise we had a race here: if
PA looks for the org.jackaudio.service name to appear on the bus and
then imemdiately connects to it while jack isn't fully accessible yet
PA would fail.
