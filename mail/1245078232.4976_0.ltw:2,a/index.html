&gt;
&gt;&gt; What I'm personally trying to achieve is a more "flexible" way  
&gt;&gt; (compared
&gt;&gt; to what is currently a bit hard-coded in JAKC2 SVN) so that a DBus
&gt;&gt; control component can be coded as a "plugin" to be possibly loaded in
&gt;&gt; JACK server process. This new plugin model allows to keep basically 2
&gt;&gt; ways of using JACK server :  the "old way" (typically starting the  
&gt;&gt; jackd
&gt;&gt; server using Qjackctl control application) or the new way using DBus
&gt;&gt; based control applications (after the DBus control plug-in has been
&gt;&gt; properly loaded in JACK server).  (Keeping the "old-way" is also
&gt;&gt; important on others platforms JACK2 runs on.)
&gt;
&gt; Distributions will certainly enable the D-Bus code in JACK if they
&gt; ship it. So, I have no problem with depending on a dbus'ified jack for
&gt; this logic to work.

In the proposed model, having "D-Bus code in JACK" will mean 1)  only  
would be on (reservation code used in ALSA backend). Having a DBus  
control plugin would be optional, that is, it should even probably be  
distributed as a separated package.

&gt; After all crazy folks who disable the dbus support
&gt; in jack because they think it's an abomination probably think that PA
&gt; is an even worse abomination anyway, so there's not need to cater for
&gt; them.

Well me current role as I see it is to try to keep "guardians" and  
"rebels" on the same boat...

&gt;
&gt;&gt; If this new "control plugin" model is finally accepted by JACK
&gt;&gt; community, then we'll distribute/package JACK2 compiled with the 1)
&gt;&gt; option, so that it (at least) cooperates with PulseAudio. But 2)  
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt; then be optional, so PA can not rely on the DBus control plug-in to
&gt;&gt; always be present.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The 1) code uses  "org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.AudioXX" name,  
&gt;&gt; and 2)
&gt;&gt; optional DBus plugin uses "org.jackaudio.service" name. If we want to
&gt;&gt; implement your proposal, the we would need to request another name  
&gt;&gt; in  1)
&gt;&gt; part, is that correct?
&gt;
&gt; I think org.jackaudio.service should be fine.

But this is activated only by the *optional* DBus control plugin..

&gt; I don't think this
&gt; automatic logic needs to work on non-D-Bus jack builds. As I see it
&gt; you don't need to make any changes on jack for this to work. All I
&gt; need is the guarantee that by the time the service name is registered
&gt; on the bus jack is fully accessible. Otherwise we had a race here: if
&gt; PA looks for the org.jackaudio.service name to appear on the bus and
&gt; then imemdiately connects to it while jack isn't fully accessible yet
&gt; PA would fail.

This is not the case right now. The org.jackaudio.service is started  
and then DBus control application can access it, to configure, start/ 
stop the server... This mean that the JACK server is not always started.

So I guess we'll have to implement something new in the 1) part, since  
I guess we want this JACK/PA cooperation, even if users are not using  
DBus based control applications to control JACK.
