In the proposed model, having "D-Bus code in JACK" will mean 1)  only  
would be on (reservation code used in ALSA backend). Having a DBus  
control plugin would be optional, that is, it should even probably be  
distributed as a separated package.

Well me current role as I see it is to try to keep "guardians" and  
"rebels" on the same boat...

But this is activated only by the *optional* DBus control plugin..

This is not the case right now. The org.jackaudio.service is started  
and then DBus control application can access it, to configure, start/ 
stop the server... This mean that the JACK server is not always started.

So I guess we'll have to implement something new in the 1) part, since  
I guess we want this JACK/PA cooperation, even if users are not using  
DBus based control applications to control JACK.
