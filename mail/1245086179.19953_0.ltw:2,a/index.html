&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just thinking, when jack2 finished initialization it takes a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; name on the session bus, right?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not sure about what you mean by " it takes name on the session bus". 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I hope Nedko can answer better here.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I simply mean it calls dbus_bus_request_name()
&gt; &gt;&gt; resp. org.freedesktop.DBus.RequestName to acquire a service name n the
&gt; &gt;&gt; session bus, such as org.jack.foo.bar.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We recently had a strong debate on JACK dev list about the way DBus  
&gt; &gt; could/should be used with JACK. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I noticed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I'm personally trying to achieve is a more "flexible" way (compared 
&gt; &gt; to what is currently a bit hard-coded in JAKC2 SVN) so that a DBus 
&gt; &gt; control component can be coded as a "plugin" to be possibly loaded in 
&gt; &gt; JACK server process. This new plugin model allows to keep basically 2 
&gt; &gt; ways of using JACK server :  the "old way" (typically starting the jackd 
&gt; &gt; server using Qjackctl control application) or the new way using DBus 
&gt; &gt; based control applications (after the DBus control plug-in has been 
&gt; &gt; properly loaded in JACK server).  (Keeping the "old-way" is also 
&gt; &gt; important on others platforms JACK2 runs on.)
&gt; 
&gt; Distributions will certainly enable the D-Bus code in JACK if they
&gt; ship it. So, I have no problem with depending on a dbus'ified jack for
&gt; this logic to work. 

&gt;From a packagers' (for Fedora/Planet CCRMA) point of view the future
dbus-capable jack should be able to be used without dbus support as well
as with it _without_ having to recompile it (that is without having to
repackage it differently). For an example of non-dbus usage, I may want
to start jack on a remote host where there is no desktop session at the
moment and thus dbus is not usable. 

&gt; &gt; If this new "control plugin" model is finally accepted by JACK  
&gt; &gt; community, then we'll distribute/package JACK2 compiled with the 1)  
&gt; &gt; option, so that it (at least) cooperates with PulseAudio. But 2) would  
&gt; &gt; then be optional, so PA can not rely on the DBus control plug-in to  
&gt; &gt; always be present.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The 1) code uses  "org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.AudioXX" name, and 2) 
&gt; &gt; optional DBus plugin uses "org.jackaudio.service" name. If we want to 
&gt; &gt; implement your proposal, the we would need to request another name in  1) 
&gt; &gt; part, is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; I think org.jackaudio.service should be fine. I don't think this
&gt; automatic logic needs to work on non-D-Bus jack builds. 

I would change the wording to "on jack instances that are not using
dbus" (ie: whether you use dbus or not should not depend on the build).

&gt; As I see it
&gt; you don't need to make any changes on jack for this to work. All I
&gt; need is the guarantee that by the time the service name is registered
&gt; on the bus jack is fully accessible. Otherwise we had a race here: if
&gt; PA looks for the org.jackaudio.service name to appear on the bus and
&gt; then imemdiately connects to it while jack isn't fully accessible yet
&gt; PA would fail.
