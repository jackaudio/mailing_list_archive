dbus-capable jack should be able to be used without dbus support as well
as with it _without_ having to recompile it (that is without having to
repackage it differently). For an example of non-dbus usage, I may want
to start jack on a remote host where there is no desktop session at the
moment and thus dbus is not usable.

I would change the wording to "on jack instances that are not using
dbus" (ie: whether you use dbus or not should not depend on the build).
