So, let's say host A is where I am logged in now and I'm running a
desktop. The I start a terminal, just do "slogin B" (for simplicity
let's assume nobody is logged in into B at the time) and then I would
have dbus running there without a desktop? What is taking care of
setting up the dbus session, is that ssh? The login process?

I understand that you _personally_ would see no value in dbus-less
builds. But others do see value. I am assuming that others might have
valid reasons for doing things in a different way, and that my view of
the universe is not the only one possible. 

In a very long thread about the dbus issues in the jack developers list
it was (I think) agreed that the core innards of jack would not
explicitly depend on dbus at compile time but rather at runtime. So you
could run jack with dbus support or without it, without having to
recompile it. Everyone is happy. Nothing is forced on anybody. Future
usage will eventually make the non-dbus option go away or not. Nobody is
inconvenienced by that.
