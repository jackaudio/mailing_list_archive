&gt; &gt; What I'm personally trying to achieve is a more "flexible" way (compared 
&gt; &gt; to what is currently a bit hard-coded in JAKC2 SVN) so that a DBus 
&gt; &gt; control component can be coded as a "plugin" to be possibly loaded in 
&gt; &gt; JACK server process. This new plugin model allows to keep basically 2 
&gt; &gt; ways of using JACK server :  the "old way" (typically starting the jackd 
&gt; &gt; server using Qjackctl control application) or the new way using DBus 
&gt; &gt; based control applications (after the DBus control plug-in has been 
&gt; &gt; properly loaded in JACK server).  (Keeping the "old-way" is also 
&gt; &gt; important on others platforms JACK2 runs on.)
&gt; 
&gt; Distributions will certainly enable the D-Bus code in JACK if they
&gt; ship it. So, I have no problem with depending on a dbus'ified jack for
&gt; this logic to work. After all crazy folks who disable the dbus support
&gt; in jack because they think it's an abomination probably think that PA
&gt; is an even worse abomination anyway, so there's not need to cater for
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If this new "control plugin" model is finally accepted by JACK  
&gt; &gt; community, then we'll distribute/package JACK2 compiled with the 1)  
&gt; &gt; option, so that it (at least) cooperates with PulseAudio. But 2) would  
&gt; &gt; then be optional, so PA can not rely on the DBus control plug-in to  
&gt; &gt; always be present.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The 1) code uses  "org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.AudioXX" name, and 2) 
&gt; &gt; optional DBus plugin uses "org.jackaudio.service" name. If we want to 
&gt; &gt; implement your proposal, the we would need to request another name in  1) 
&gt; &gt; part, is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; I think org.jackaudio.service should be fine. I don't think this
&gt; automatic logic needs to work on non-D-Bus jack builds. As I see it
&gt; you don't need to make any changes on jack for this to work. All I
&gt; need is the guarantee that by the time the service name is registered
&gt; on the bus jack is fully accessible. Otherwise we had a race here: if
&gt; PA looks for the org.jackaudio.service name to appear on the bus and
&gt; then imemdiately connects to it while jack isn't fully accessible yet
&gt; PA would fail.

the existence of org.jackaudio.service object does not guarantee,
that jackd is connectable.

i guess we need a signal, which tells that a server has been started,
but i leave this to the dbus guys.

my primary concern is to have the pa jack backend fixed. 
lennart himself said its a TOY. and it really is.

i dont really understand why it works, but its pretty broken, for sure.


static int jack_process(jack_nframes_t nframes, void *arg) {
    struct userdata *u = arg;
    unsigned c;
    jack_nframes_t frame_time;
    pa_assert(u);

    /* We just forward the request to our other RT thread */

    for (c = 0; c &lt; u-&gt;channels; c++)
        pa_assert_se(u-&gt;buffer[c] = jack_port_get_buffer(u-&gt;port[c], nframes));

    frame_time = jack_frame_time(u-&gt;client);

    pa_assert_se(pa_asyncmsgq_send(u-&gt;jack_msgq, PA_MSGOBJECT(u-&gt;sink), SINK_MESSAGE_RENDER, &amp;frame_time, nframes, NULL) == 0);
    return 0;
}


it needs to be decoupled using a ringbuffer.
and maybe pulse should be running with a higher blocksize than jack ?
