the existence of org.jackaudio.service object does not guarantee,
that jackd is connectable.

i guess we need a signal, which tells that a server has been started,
but i leave this to the dbus guys.

my primary concern is to have the pa jack backend fixed. 
lennart himself said its a TOY. and it really is.

i dont really understand why it works, but its pretty broken, for sure.


static int jack_process(jack_nframes_t nframes, void *arg) {
    struct userdata *u = arg;
    unsigned c;
    jack_nframes_t frame_time;
    pa_assert(u);

    /* We just forward the request to our other RT thread */

    for (c = 0; c < u->channels; c++)
        pa_assert_se(u->buffer[c] = jack_port_get_buffer(u->port[c], nframes));

    frame_time = jack_frame_time(u->client);

    pa_assert_se(pa_asyncmsgq_send(u->jack_msgq, PA_MSGOBJECT(u->sink), SINK_MESSAGE_RENDER, &frame_time, nframes, NULL) == 0);
    return 0;
}


it needs to be decoupled using a ringbuffer.
and maybe pulse should be running with a higher blocksize than jack ?
