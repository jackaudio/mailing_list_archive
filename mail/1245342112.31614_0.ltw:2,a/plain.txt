I'd consider that brokeness in Jack then. Taking the name on the bus
sould be the last step during initialization. Otherwise you'll always
be in racy situations where clients try to talk to JACK while JACK is
only half-way initialized.

Nope. That is the wrong approach.

Aha.

Uh? That is actually what happens. 

This is a bit more complex than you might think. Jack's thread
management is very unflexible and insists on controlling the entire
thread life cycle, only calling into client code in very few
occasions. This is a bit too limited for PA which needs better control
on the RT loops so that it can properly priorize/order the work it
needs to do in it. To work around that I decided to run two RT
threads, one where PA does its own RT looping, and the one jack
controls. The latter then simply relays the process requests
synchronously to the former. This of course comes at the cost of a
needless context switch, however both threads are RT. The normal PA RT
loop thread communicates lock-free and asynchronously with the rest of
the PA code.

Yes, having to work around JACK's API like this is certainly not
nice. But aside from the extra context switch this shouldn't be too
bad.

Of course it would great if JACK would be more flexible with its RT
loop handling. What I am missing is basically a way to
asynchronously/lock-free trigger execution of a callback function in
the RT loop at a suitable place. By a "suitable place" I mean that the
RT loop delays execution of this callback until a time where its
impact would be minimal, i.e. right after a completed process() and a
quick verification that the next process() cycle is still a bit away.

Why does pa need those callbacks? In contrast to JACK we need to be
able to modify our pipelines during playback without having that cause
drop-outs in any way. To accomplish that updates to pipeline related
data structures that need to be accessed by the RT loop are as far as
possible done in the main thread, however usually the last remaining
bit for activating those changes is left for the RT loop to do itself,
asynchronously and only when it can be sure that nothing else needs to
be done. That way we can have those data structures implemented
lock-free without really having to implement them with all that
lock-free complexity.

> and maybe pulse should be running with a higher blocksize than jack ?

PA does not use fixed block sizes. We always use the largest chunk
sizes the applications pass to us and break them up into smaller
pieces only when really necessary. We really try our best not having
to touch/convert/split/copy user supplied PCM data if we don't have
to.
