Hum...even if this info would be available, it does not say what  
*actual* duration would take the following clients ...

I think we should go back to the beginning of the discussion: allow PA  
based audio desktop application be used in the JACK graph. It don't  
think it make sense to over-complexify JACK or JACK/PA interaction  
just to avoid a thread context switch.

Better keep the current separated simple solution, until it can be  
proven it is a real bottleneck.
