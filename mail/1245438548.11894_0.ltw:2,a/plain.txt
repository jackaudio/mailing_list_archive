I'd like to clarify something,

org.jackaudio.service exposes the controller object. It is not the server,
it is the controller, a peristent endpoint that can be used to start and
stop the server on user request. jack clients are usually not supposed
to check whether jack server is started. It will be either autostarted
or libjack "initialization" will fail if autostart is disabled and jack
server is stopped.

The dbus object name that is used for cooperation with PA is different
thing.
