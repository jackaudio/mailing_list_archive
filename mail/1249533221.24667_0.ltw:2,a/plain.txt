Subject:     [LAD] dbus using up resources

Hi,

A recent observation has been made of the jack + pulse audio union that 
it uses up a lot of resources when running. It's not the first report 
that running pulse + jack causes things to overheat and lockup. The 
report was posted to the jack-devel list a couple of days ago.

According to the original poster it is hald and dbus which are taking on 
the extra load.

To me this sounds like an implementation bug in the jack or pulse code 
as neither hald or dbus should consume extra resources beyond their 
standard footprint.

Does anyone have an idea of why this could be happening? It's probably a 
very simple oversight somewhere.

I'm gonna spend some time now to test my system and see if I can 
reproduce it.



Cheers.
