Subject:     Re: [LAD] LADI

Hi :)

*Clarification from the viewpoint of a user*

For me, as a user only, there are some "reasons", resp. "fears" why I 
never tested LADI:

I don't know what exactly it can handle. Which apps can be handled by 
LADI? What needs to be set up for the apps? In other words, will it 
really handle a session or just some points of a session? I once tested 
LASH and it wasn't able to handle anything I need. Without much 
knowledge about writing shell scripts, I'm able to launch wanted apps 
and restore connections, not the perfect way I would like to have, e.g. 
because I still need to place the windows, but without trouble, while 
e.g LASH does not do this this job, maybe because I missed to google for 
hours to learn the basics about LASH.

Are there packages or do I have to compile it by solving a dependency hell?

How will it handle a session when some audio apps tend to crash on my 
machine? Will this cause trouble for LADI? Is LADI some kind of program 
that will run during the session or will it just run similar to a shell 
script just to launch and restore a set up, resp. just when saving a set 
up? When using a session handler, will it be possible that an app that 
normally is stable, become unstable?

A shell script isn't a session handler, but anyway it can restore a lot 
and that without any requirements, limitations, because of apps that are 
not compiled to be fine with LASH, LADI or what session handler ever.

*Willing to test it*

I'm willing to give LADI a chance and try to add it to my 64 Studio 
3.0-beta3 x86_64 and openSUSE 11.2 x86_64.
I'm willing to spend some hours to google and read about LADI.

*But*

I'm not willing to troubleshoot any problems, if it would make handling 
my sessions more difficult, than it would be without "a", resp. "this" 
session handler.

I guess I can try to add LADI this week to my Linux installs :).

Cheers,
Ralf
