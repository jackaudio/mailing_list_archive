My understanding matches Olivier's.  Intel processors have strong memory
ordering, and so on them the jack ringbuffer is safe without memory
barriers. However, some PPC processors, and SPARC V9s under linux  
(but not
Solaris), use weak memory ordering, and on them, the jack ringbuffer  
code
can theoretically fail.

See the "ring buffer memory barriers" discussion on jack-devel back in
October of last year for more information; in particular, this article
by Paul E. McKenney is very helpful:

http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8211

And, until the jack ringbuffer gets fixed, the PortAudio ringbuffer
appears safe for use on multiprocessor weakly-ordered systems.
