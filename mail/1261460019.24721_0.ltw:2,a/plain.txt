I really think there should be a quit-without-save.

Also, with respect to saving and restoring sessions, 
suppose this work-flow:

   1. Save a session (#1) with Ardour as a part of it.
      Instead of transferring GB of data to the
      session-data-dir, it stores a handle[1] to the
      data (i.e. a URI tracing back to a save state).

   2. When session #1 is reloaded, Ardour loads the
      handle to the original project's save state.

   3. User forces an export to the session-data-dir.
      This means that Ardour must transfer all the
      gigabytes of data necc. to recreate the session.

   4. User opens session #1 from an exported archive.
      Ardour finds heavy data in the session-data-dir,
      and uses it (rather than, say, importing the
      data to  some other location).

   5. User does a "save as" on the current session,
      thus saving Session #2.  Ardour saves a handle to
      a save-state from Session #1 (and Session #1's
      session-data-dir).

   6. User deletes Session #1.  They now
      have also corrupted Session #2.

This just seems, to me, messy and error-prone.  To the end 
user, I don't think it would ever be obvious that Session #2 
depended on Session #1.  Meanwhile application developers 
have to find a stable way to work with session data, whether 
it's handles or heavy data.  They also have to negotiate 
what it means when the user says "Save," but the data is in 
a session-data-dir, and the user /didn't/ say "Save 
Session."

Ways that it might be cleaned up:

   1. Always require that session data be "heavy"
      in the session-data-dir.

      - or -

   2. Only store handles to session data... and
      don't even have a session-data-dir.  Export
      is a special step.  Exported sessions must be
      "imported" before being used.

      - or -

   3. Session manager implements some manner of
      "session data database" that manages the
      dependencies between resources and sessions.[2]
      Applications transfer data to session manager
      as something like a zip stream... and the session
      manager is responsible for storage and retrieval.

#1 is, I think, the most stable... but at the price of 
wasting a lot of disk space.  #2 is fast and efficient, but 
at a much greater risk of corrupting session data.  #3 is 
like #1, but the session manager implementation is able to 
conserve resources and even be on another host.

[1] In my e-mail in November, I used the word "stub"
     instead of "handle."
[2] Yes, this idea is a little "out there." :-)
