The second milestone is reached and result is a tarball that brave souls
may want to download and try. It can start apps and restore their
connections. Level 1 apps are supported.

Beware that no apps have implemented level 1 yet. If non-level-1 app is
started at level 1, it will probably quit on save, because the default
signal handler for SIGUSR1 terminates the process.

This preview also features a2jmidid support. Run the a2j script as an
app in the studio.

This is a beta quality software, use it with double caution.

I would like to thank the early adopters and especially Frank Kober for
their help with testing the git ladish code and for the valuable
suggestions they gave.

Build will produce three operational components:
 * ladishd - The daemon, a D-Bus service
 * gladish - GTK GUI interface
 * ladish_control - Command-line interface

In the tarball you will also find bundled:
 * flowcanvas-0.6.0
 * LADI Tools (svn version)
 * a2jmidid-6 (contains the a2j script for use in ladish)
 * jack2 from the ladi branch

The jack2 ladi branch contains fixes for two important issues:
 * Race that causes connection restore to fail sometimes during studio
   startup (http://ladish.org/ticket/28)
 * A deadlock on studio start (http://ladish.org/ticket/35)

Hopefully, these fixes with be in the next jack2 release (1.9.5).

The jack2 ladi branch also contains the no-self-connect changeset that
adds new engine option, for disabling self connect of apps. Default
value for this option is to allow self connections.

Make sure to configure jack2 with --dbus (and maybe with --classic too).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
LADI Session Handler or simply ladish is a session management system
for JACK applications on GNU/Linux. Its aim is to allow you to have
many different audio programs running at once, to save their setup,
close them down and then easily reload the setup at some other
time. ladish doesn't deal with any kind of audio or MIDI data itself;
it just runs programs, deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data and
connects JACK ports together. It can also be used to move entire
sessions between computers, or post sessions on the Internet for
download.

Project goals:
 * Save and restore sets of JACK (audio and MIDI) enabled
   applications.
 * Provide JACK clients with virtual hardware ports, so projects can
   be transfered (or backups restored) between computers running
   different hardware and backups. 
 * Don't require session handling library to be used. There is no need
   of such library for restoring connections between JACK clients.
 * Flow canvas based GUI. Positions of elements on the canvas are
   saved/restored.
 * Allow clients to use external storage to save its state. This
   includes storing internal state to non-filesystem place like memory
   of a hardware synth. This also includes storing client internal
   state (client project data) in a way that is not directly bound to
   ladish project. 
 * Import/export operations, as opposed to save/load. Save/load
   operate in current system and may cause saving data outside of
   project itself (external storage). Import/export uses/produces
   "tarball" suitable for transferring session data over network to
   other computer or storing it in a backup archive.
 * Hierarchical or tag-based organization of projects.
 * List of JACK applications. Applications are always started through
   ladish to have restored runtime environment closer to one existed
   before project save.
 * Distributed studio - network connected computers. Netjack
   configuration is part of the studio and thus is saved/restored.
 * Collaborate with the X11 window manager so window properties like
   window position, virtual desktop and screen (multimonitor) are
   saved/restored.
