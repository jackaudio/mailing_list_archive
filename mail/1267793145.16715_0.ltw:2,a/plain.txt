Does any substantive Linux audio development discussion actually
happen on LAD any more?

I've only just discovered (because of your email and another pointer
to the list from LAU) that any of this session management stuff was
being discussed on jack-devel.

I don't think I've ever been subscribed to that list, at least since
it moved from SourceForge -- after all, I'm not a JACK developer.  But
I am interested in session management.  I've just subscribed to it,
and it looks like I have rather a lot to catch up on.

Hm.
