&gt; Well, when you're talking about changes to the JACK API, that discussion
&gt; belongs on Jack-Devel, doesn't it?

Yes.  But the subject really is "session management for Linux audio
applications".  The fact that JACK is involved is (waves hand
dismissively in manner of a Paris waiter) an implementation detail.

&gt; The JACK site[1] says, "If you're doing anything with jack, you need to be
&gt; on this list."

True enough.  Though I've been doing things with JACK for many years
without ever having read that page before.  And -devel lists are
usually for developers of whatever it is they're about, not users of
it.

Anyway -- really I'm just cross about missing things through my own
inertia.  I suspect the real reason I'm not on that list is that I
never got around to moving my subscription there, having previously
been subscribed to the now defunct [hidden].
 This is the first time I've really been aware that the "new" list was
any more active than the old!
