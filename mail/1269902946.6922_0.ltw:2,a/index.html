Hi Fernando
Can't help you on the coding but if you find a way to link two RME PCI hdsp
cards to show as one please pass this along.

I have two cards that I have to constantly change as the Bois seems to
change the order of the cards on Boot up ( I use jack to select the cards)


Cheers

&gt; At CCRMA we have several studios with linux computers in them (in
&gt; addition to computers sprinkled throughout the building). Some of the
&gt; studios have digiface interfaces, some multiface. All of them are
&gt; connected to the sound system or mixer digitally through adat
&gt; lightpipes. Workstations have Delta 66 or Gina3G soundcards.
&gt;
&gt; It would be nice for a user to be able to play, say, a stereo Ardour
&gt; session in any of them without any changes to the session or routing.
&gt;
&gt; The digifaces send channels 1-24 out the adat ports. The multifaces on
&gt; the other hand send 9-16 on the adat port. Deltas and Ginas send out
&gt; stuff on channels 1-4 or 1-6.
&gt;
&gt; You can see the multiface interfaces are a problem. To get sound out of
&gt; them you have to send on channels 9-16 which is different from _all_
&gt; others!
&gt;
&gt; I tried several workarounds without much success:
&gt;
&gt; a) fix this at the alsa level. Should be the way to go, right? Create
&gt; an /etc/asound.conf that uses ttable to translate channels for the
&gt; multifaces so that the digital out is actually sent through channels 1-8
&gt; (and create the same name plug interface in all other computers that
&gt; does nothing so that the user can set that name as the default in
&gt; qjackctl and will get the same behavior in all computers).
&gt;
&gt; Works, but not quite. When I try to use that "fake" plug interface with
&gt; jack2 I get a warning that I'm using a plug interface (sort of fair) and
&gt; jack only opens it with _2_ i/o channels (even though the ttable is 18
&gt; channels wide!). If I _force_ input and output channels in jack to 18 it
&gt; does work fine. But now it will _not_ work on other computers that have
&gt; less (or more) than 18 channels. Argh.
&gt;
&gt; b) fix it in hdspmixer. Well, it turns out that hdspmixer does not read
&gt; the default matrix gains from a file so I can't really override the
&gt; default. AFAICT the gains are calculated algorithmically in the code and
&gt; there is no command line option to load presets from a file.
&gt;
&gt; Or I could write a small script that will set the right gains for 1-8 to
&gt; go out through 9-16 but if a user starts hdspmixer that gets undone with
&gt; no warning.
&gt;
&gt; And, of course:
&gt;
&gt; c) give up and connect an 8 channel analog snake to the analog outputs
&gt; of the multifaces and do away with a digital connection to the mixer...
&gt;
&gt; Anyone has any other suggestions??
&gt; This should be easy to fix, right?
&gt; :-)
