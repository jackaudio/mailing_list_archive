Subject:     Re: [LAD] digiface vs. multiface vs. jack vs. other cards

Hi Fernando
Can't help you on the coding but if you find a way to link two RME PCI hdsp
cards to show as one please pass this along.

I have two cards that I have to constantly change as the Bois seems to
change the order of the cards on Boot up ( I use jack to select the cards)


Cheers
