hi folks,

I just saw an interesting line over at opensuse.org (
http://news.opensuse.org/2010/04/14/opensuse-11-3-milestone-5-the-community-strikes-back/)
regarding the installation of JACK2 as default in the upcoming opensuse 11.3
release. That wasn't the interesting part. This is:

The JACK team is coordinating with openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian, among
&gt; others, to upgrade to jack 1.9.5 (JACK2) during the spring/summer release
&gt; cycle.
&gt;

This seems to imply that there is quite a large move happening across
multiple distros, and that move is being coordinated with JACK developers.
I'm not a dev and I'm not really comfortable commenting on dev issues, but
is this really accurate? Personally I'd be glad if there were such a move as
JACK2 is what I use, but my understanding is that no announcements have been
made by JACK devs regarding an official obsoletion of JACK1.  The reference
provided with that statement is a very short email correspondence on the
opensuse-factory mailing list about the topic that references an unmentioned
debian-multimedia contact.

Are any interested or invested parties willing to provide some clarification
on this? I know distros are fully welcome to package whatever they wish. I
also am pretty sure that whatever happens will happen regardless of my
opinion on the matter. There have, however, been some colorful exchanges
between packagers and devs regarding JACK in the past so in the interest of
transparency and openness I was hoping involved parties might have something
to say about this.
