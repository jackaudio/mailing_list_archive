This could all be true, but that's not the point I was talking about.
JACK2 was planned as successor of JACK1. But at some point that changed,
that's all ok, not the point here. But isn't it odd that this isn't
clearly communicated with the JACK2 maintainer, why this is happened?
That was raising questions here about the communication within the
(highly appreciated) JACK project.
