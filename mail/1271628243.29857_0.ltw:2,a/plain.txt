its sort of my fault. i dont feel comfortable with the jack2 codebase.
this partly has to do with the style used. 
the important thing however is the class hirarchy.

i find it unacceptable that i need to add a method to 5 classes to
implement some new api function for example.
i end up writing a lot of boilerplate code i find useless, and 
i really hate to write useless code.

many of the other design decisions dont make sense to me, and i am
having a pretty hard time finding the relevant code fragments.
(who would search for the servers event processing loop in the platform
specific Communication channels ?)

this makes hacking jack2 a rather unpleasant experience for me.
since nobody pays me to work on jack and i am doing this for fun.
i minimize hacking jack2.

yet since nobody will do the jack2 session patch i am forced again to
work on jack2.

i wrote tschack because i wanted to try out a different approach to the
functionality in jack2. and to understand how a parallel jack works.
now some people who had bad experience with jack2 tried it, and it works
for them. 
so there is no reason to hide tschack. 

i dont see a reason to try to get stephane to reconsider his design
decisions. it were his decisions, and he seems to be happy with them.
my way is to start from scratch with a new c++ implementation.
for me this has the benefit of not using CamelCase. which will never get
removed from jack2 (why should it? stephane likes it)

regarding distros move to jack2 i think its the right thing.
i just made sure, that it will be possible to install an alternative
jack implementation. 
iE people had a pretty hard time installing jack2 on debian. 
if they had just moved to jack2 without making libjack a virtual
package, people would have problems instlling jack1 or tschack.
now the packagers dont really want to package N versions of jack, since
they would need to test all combinations of apps and jacks.

but as long as sombody is able to provide jack1 and tschack .debs it
will be fine.
packagers are happy, and other people are able to install some
alternative.
