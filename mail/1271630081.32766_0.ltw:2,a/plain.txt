No, Jack2 (then jackdmp) was not planned as a successor of Jack1. It
was initially planned as an alternate implementation and a playground
to try out some ideas, mostly because Stephane didn't feel that it was
going to be easy to do that with the existing C codebase of Jack (and
I think that everybody else agreed with him about that). *Later*, we
agreed that Jack2 would become the successor of Jack1.
