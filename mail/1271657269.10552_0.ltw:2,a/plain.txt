Because 3 different platform dependant communication scheme are supported : Mig generated RPC on OSX, sockets for Linux/Solaris, pipes on WIndows. And a new API has to be implemented on server and library side, thus as several places yes.

Since jack2 OSX version was developed first, Mig generated RPC was tested at that time. It could probably be replaced by Posix socket code, but last time I tried if was failing (I guess they are still some subtle differences between OSX and others Posix OS concerning sockets.)

Because on OSX the "event processing loop" is handled in the Mig generated RPC code , so the "event processing loop" moves in the "platform specific communication channels". 

If OSX specific stuff is removed, then the "event processing loop"  may go in a more generic part the code yes.

A Linux specific version ? (so would be simpler yes) or a multi-platform version?

So naming convention (class, class fields...)  yes?

I don't see (yet) any of the proposed arguments as "fundamental" critic of the jack2 design. Some improvements are certainly possible, like trying to remove this OSX specific server//client communication code, and we could agree on that. I don't think starting a new c++ implementation will improve the situation. If a Linux specific version only is developed, then we move a step back yes?. But OTOH nobody is never forced to do anything in OSS.
