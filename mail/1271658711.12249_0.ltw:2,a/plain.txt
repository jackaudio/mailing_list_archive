It was jackdmp *then* jack2 ((-:

The reasons for a new code base were multiple:

- after the initial "jack1on OSX work" , I has a good understanding of the C code, enough to think that going for the SMP *and* multi-platform support would be a nightmare... or would require huge rework, that was done in the C+ version indeed.

- they were some stability problems on OSX (like random crashes..) I could not find and fix. The kind of crash I usually describe as coming from "too complex and non understandable code"

- they were some subtle bugs in the C code (like memory leaks in jack port management because of this double sever side/client side management, some shared memory issue.. some more i don't remember right now)

The C++ code base then has been improved by a lot of people, Michael Voigt did a lot of work to improve multi-platform support (for his L4/drop port), Tim Blechmann simplified the C++ class hierarchy and did optimization everywhere, Nedko added the control API and D-Bus support in *pure* C with his own naming conversion (so this can even be done..), Devin Anderson added some MIDI related code.... etc...
