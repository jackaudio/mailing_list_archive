That'd be correct if Ralf would stick to 'amidiplay' and friends for his
tests.

There are a couple of audio-tools who can use either RTC or HPET for
timing, although most of them need an option to explicitly enable it.

Thanks for that explanation. It makes perfect sense.
I take it the same must be true for dev.rtc.max-user-freq as well.

BTW. Do you know the unit of these values?
  cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/max_user_freq
  cat /proc/sys/dev/hpet/max-user-freq
are they Hz?

linux-2.6/Documentation/hpet.txt does not mention it at all and
linux-2.6/Documentation/rtc.txt hints it's Hz but does not explicitly
say so.

It limits the maximum frequency at which user-space applications can
[request to] receive "wakeup calls" from the hr-timer.
