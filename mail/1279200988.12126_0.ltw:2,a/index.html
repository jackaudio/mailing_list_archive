&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This parameter will not have any effect on anything because there is no

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That'd be correct if Ralf would stick to 'amidiplay' and friends for his
&gt;&gt; tests.
&gt; 
&gt; While at least one friend throw his Apple MacOs through the window. I'm
&gt; not kidding. Modern computers + music + my friends = not good. I've got
&gt; two kinds of friends, the once who say I shouldn't use a modern computer
&gt; and the others who say, I should buy Nuendo and expensive hardware. And
&gt; btw. I don't have got 1000 friends, but just a handful.
&gt; If I would ask my neighbours to listen, they would be fine with bad
&gt; timing, regarding to their habits, listening to the radio at prime time.

Took me a while to catch that drift. I meant friends of 'amidiplay'
(eg 'amidirecord', 'aseqdump', etc) with the aim to keep things simple
for testing.

"..and friends" is an English idiom; sorry to put you off track.

&gt; Anyway, I could ask people to listen, but I'm sure this would be
&gt; useless.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There are a couple of audio-tools who can use either RTC or HPET for
&gt;&gt; timing, although most of them need an option to explicitly enable it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When high-resolution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timers are used by ALSA, this is done inside the kernel where there is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no limit on the maximum frequency.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for that explanation. It makes perfect sense.
&gt;&gt; I take it the same must be true for dev.rtc.max-user-freq as well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BTW. Do you know the unit of these values?
&gt;&gt;   cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/max_user_freq
&gt;&gt;   cat /proc/sys/dev/hpet/max-user-freq
&gt;&gt; are they Hz?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; linux-2.6/Documentation/hpet.txt does not mention it at all and
&gt;&gt; linux-2.6/Documentation/rtc.txt hints it's Hz but does not explicitly
&gt;&gt; say so.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Clemens
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; IIRC someone on jack-devel mailing list had issues when using mplayer
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the value 64 and it was solved when using the value 1024. But as I
&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned before, for my USB MIDI there was a difference between system
&gt;&gt;&gt; timer and hr timer, but there was no difference for the value 64 and
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1024, when using hr timer.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Btw. I don't understand what a maximum frequency in the context does
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean. If 64 or 1024 should have impact, what would be the result?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; System timer for a kernel-rt is set up to 1000Hz and hr timer is at
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000000000Hz.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; What is 'max-user-freq' for?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It limits the maximum frequency at which user-space applications can
&gt;&gt; [request to] receive "wakeup calls" from the hr-timer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; see also the "Timers" thread on LAD last November:
&gt;&gt; http://linuxaudio.org/mailarchive/lad/2009/11/7/161647
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, what ever user-space might be, 

It's the opposite of "kernel-space" :)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space

&gt; I assume regarding to the
&gt; explanations it's unimportant for rt. And as mentioned by the text of
&gt; the link, I can confirm that at least my USB MIDI is better when using
&gt; hr timer.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll test amidiplay, but again, playing all MIDI instruments at the same
&gt; isn't the major problem, perhaps just for me, resp. for people with
&gt; 'golden ears'.

Lets try something very simple:

ONE)
- Take a very simple midi-file.
- Use 'aplaymidi' to send it from your PC to your external midi-drum
machine. - Use your drum-synth's "klick" or "woodblock" sound or sth
very dry with a good attack.
- do a quick ear-test if you can hear midi-jitter?
- capture the audio-output of the external-midi-synth with arecord.

Rewind and do it again.
Post the two files and the used .mid on a web-server or some drop-box.

If you want to check yourself: Align the first-beat of the captured
audio files in a multi-track audio-editor. While it will involve a bit
of manual labor to quantify the jitter. It'll at least be solid evidence.


TWO)
- launch an external MIDI-metronome (eg your Atari ST)
- connect it to your PC
- use 'arecordmidi' to generate a .mid file from it.

Repeat at least once and post the two midi files somewhere for us to
download.


THREE)
  midi-metronom -&gt; PC -&gt; external-synth ==&gt; audio

This combines ONE+TWO. just use 'aconnect[gui]' to use
your PC as MIDI-THRU. and 'arecord' to record audio that comes
from your drum-synth.

Note, at the moment we're not interested in latency, but in jitter.
The ticks in the recorded audio file _should be_ at identical intervals
+- jitter.

The output of
  cat /proc/asound/timers
and
  cat /proc/asound/version
might be interesting

Is that about right? Comments anyone?

&gt; The major issue is sync to audio recordings of MIDI instruments, while
&gt; doing audio recordings of other, resp. the same instruments again.
&gt; 
&gt; I e.g. do only have one DX7 and one Matrix-1000 and my TG33 (with vector
&gt; control) is broken, hence I can't use all outputs, but one stereo output
&gt; of the TG33.
&gt; 
&gt; I wish to be able to record a synth several times. This means that even
&gt; inaudible jitter will become audible, for a production.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I won't record one drum after the other from any of my drum
&gt; modules, because this just would result in more noise, but recording the
&gt; snare or kick separated to other drum samples is needed, when doing the
&gt; mastering by Linux and using a compressor like JAMin.
&gt; 
&gt; Accumulation of jitter, caused by recording one instrument after the
&gt; other is breaking the groove.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers!
