Took me a while to catch that drift. I meant friends of 'amidiplay'
(eg 'amidirecord', 'aseqdump', etc) with the aim to keep things simple
for testing.

"..and friends" is an English idiom; sorry to put you off track.

It's the opposite of "kernel-space" :)

Lets try something very simple:

ONE)
- Take a very simple midi-file.
- Use 'aplaymidi' to send it from your PC to your external midi-drum
machine. - Use your drum-synth's "klick" or "woodblock" sound or sth
very dry with a good attack.
- do a quick ear-test if you can hear midi-jitter?
- capture the audio-output of the external-midi-synth with arecord.

Rewind and do it again.
Post the two files and the used .mid on a web-server or some drop-box.

If you want to check yourself: Align the first-beat of the captured
audio files in a multi-track audio-editor. While it will involve a bit
of manual labor to quantify the jitter. It'll at least be solid evidence.


TWO)
- launch an external MIDI-metronome (eg your Atari ST)
- connect it to your PC
- use 'arecordmidi' to generate a .mid file from it.

Repeat at least once and post the two midi files somewhere for us to
download.


THREE)
  midi-metronom -> PC -> external-synth ==> audio

This combines ONE+TWO. just use 'aconnect[gui]' to use
your PC as MIDI-THRU. and 'arecord' to record audio that comes
from your drum-synth.

Note, at the moment we're not interested in latency, but in jitter.
The ticks in the recorded audio file _should be_ at identical intervals
+- jitter.

The output of
  cat /proc/asound/timers
and
  cat /proc/asound/version
might be interesting

Is that about right? Comments anyone?
