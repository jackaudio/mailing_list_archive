Jack can read the current time from /dev/hpet, but it does not use it to
generate interrupts.  As far as I know, there is no program that does.

Yes.

This has nothing to do with MIDI timing; mplayer can use the RTC (not
HPET) for audio/video synchronization to work around the 100 Hz limit of
the system timer on old Linux kernels.
