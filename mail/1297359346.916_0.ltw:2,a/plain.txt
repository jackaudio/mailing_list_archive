I remember them explaining it years ago, before jack2.

There are quite a few packages that link to libjack and conditionally
use JACK (if it is running), but use some other interface if it is
not. Their packages must depend on libjack to make that test.

Some users objected, however, to installing a "daemon" without their
knowledge and explicit permission. These were mostly people who do not
use JACK at all. Since jackd looks like a "daemon" from their
perspective, the packagers decided on a separate server package
(mainly to shut them up, I suspect).
