I'm a debian user, and I switch from time to time between jack1 and
jack2, to make some test to see if things handled different, therefore I
have dummy packages for both versions witch I install over the version I
didn't wone use now, and install the full version witch I will use. This
way I never get dependency problems. I cant remember a case were a app
have problems with that. For the package management system (apt) it
looks like I have ever both versions installed. 
I just notice some minor diff's in client registration handling.
