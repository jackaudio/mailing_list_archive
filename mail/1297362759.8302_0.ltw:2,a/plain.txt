this is itself a small problem when applied to JACK.

the whole point of API *and* ABI compatibility is that no such
recompile is actually necessary. a system that rebuilds all JACK
clients when the version of JACK changes *regardless of the nature of
that change* is a system that is doing the wrong thing.

so although there are some distinct differences between the way gentoo
does things and the way debian and its cousins do things, gentoo
doesn't or shouldn't do anything any different when the installed
version of JACK is changed, for the most part.
