I know that, I have been using distros like debian and suse for years.
But the process of using gentoo is a little bit more involved. An user
must understand what stuffs like CFLAGS and march are. I don't have a
programmer background and it took me 2 different gentoo installations
to understand what I can and must do, and what I must not do with
portage. :)

My main point was not this. It was than the difference in jack header
files doesn't matter from a packager (or user) POV. They are installed
into the system and the jack aware applications just compile and work
with any of them. If they don't work, it is not an API or ABI issue, but
a bug somewhere.
