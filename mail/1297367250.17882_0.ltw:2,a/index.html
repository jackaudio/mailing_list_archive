&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Unless the users distinctly want to use a different flavour of jack. But
&gt; &gt; then again they should know what they are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... this doesn't sound like the typical LAU user.  They
&gt; do notice, and you just know that people are going to
&gt; shorten it to libjack2 in a ML post and IRC.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And if they know even better, they let the distributions version live in
&gt; &gt; /usr and compile/install their wanted version in $HOME, adjust
&gt; &gt; PKG_CONFIG_PATH, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH and be fine with it :-)
&gt; 
&gt; ...except that Jack1 prohibits this, and you've
&gt; probably just invoked the wrath of Paul again.  :-)

Now that I think of it, I overwrote my installed jack1 with a custom one. Only 
when I want to use jack2 I install that to $HOME and have all apps magically 
working with it...

I wonder why jack1 isn't capable of running from $HOME and superseeding any 
version in /usr...

Yes, I am aware that doing the $HOME-trick will get Paul to bite me in the 
a**. I am not recommedning this to anyone who doesn't know about the way the 
variables work. And everyone who knows about it, will do it that way without 
me telling him. BTW: I think some distros append $HOME/bin to path when its 
present. If they did the same for LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH it would 
be much easier...

Have fun,

Arnold
