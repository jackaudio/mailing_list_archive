Now that I think of it, I overwrote my installed jack1 with a custom one. Only 
when I want to use jack2 I install that to $HOME and have all apps magically 
working with it...

I wonder why jack1 isn't capable of running from $HOME and superseeding any 
version in /usr...

Yes, I am aware that doing the $HOME-trick will get Paul to bite me in the 
a**. I am not recommedning this to anyone who doesn't know about the way the 
variables work. And everyone who knows about it, will do it that way without 
me telling him. BTW: I think some distros append $HOME/bin to path when its 
present. If they did the same for LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH it would 
be much easier...

Have fun,

Arnold
