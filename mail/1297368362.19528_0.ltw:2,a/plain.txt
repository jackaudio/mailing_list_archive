It is very likely this is done to allow either jack to be installed. For 
that to happen you have to have two packages named differently that 
provide the same "virtual" name so that other packages that depend on it 
can resolve dependencies correctly with either of them.

So you could have, say, "jack1" and "jack2" both providing "jack", 
applications that use jack will require "jack" and then either of the 
servers that is installed would satisfy that. Now, for some reason (a 
Debian policy probably) they split the library from the rest, thus the 
naming.

(I'm not a Debian packager so this may be missing some subtle points)
