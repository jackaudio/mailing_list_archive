&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Arne,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The library I had in mind would appear to the JACK server as a single
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; client, there would be no means to look inside it. Any JACK control
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; application (wether it be QJackCtl, patchage or any other) would only
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; see that client and would neither be able to change connections inside
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that client nor to add or remove any of the "child" clients within that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; client.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Side-rooms defiently appear this way, their "child" clients cannot be
&gt; &gt;&gt; viewed, nor modified by using patchage. the same goes for ingen.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; in both cases they appear as "simple" clients in your connections window.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ladish is still using jack.
&gt; &gt; no jack implementation scales to 100s of inprocess clients.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; most of the code of jack deals with the interprocess cooperation.
&gt; &gt; all this code is not needed in a modular engine, because its all
&gt; &gt; residing inside the same process.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Obviously your goal is more like What Paul is explaining about Ardour3 though.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; yes. the problem space is pretty different from jacks problem.
&gt; &gt; i am not as pessimistic as paul, that jacks api wouldnt handle the
&gt; &gt; problem space, but the implementation would need to be radically
&gt; &gt; different.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; in a modular engine you need to be able to deal with hundreds of
&gt; &gt; modules. it wouldnt scale to create a thread for any of these.
&gt; &gt; and the buffers need to be managed in a smarter way. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; because it must be implemented differently, i dont really see much value
&gt; &gt; in reusing jacks api for this. (main reason is that jacks api is C, and
&gt; &gt; i would implement a modular engine in c++)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for these thoughts...
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, the JACK APi might not be ideal for such a use case, but my main
&gt; point is that it could make it much easier to reuse existing code. In
&gt; theory you could take any (simple enough) JACK client and just make it a
&gt; module of your app. Or you could take any module of the app (if it is
&gt; not tied too deep to other things in the app) and make it a JACK client.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is just how many apps would use such a wrapper library?

given that most apps use LADSPA or LV2 for this very purpose, i dont
think this api would be very popular ;)
