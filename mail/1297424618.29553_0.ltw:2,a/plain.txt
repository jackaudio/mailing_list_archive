this is like claiming some software is bugfree, and then finding a bug.
we always said, that if ABI incompatibility shows up, its a bug.

and we normally react pretty quickly, when its raised on the ML.
the real problem are the different thread semantics of 
jack1 vs. (jack2 tschack)

these are very subtle, and poorly documented.
