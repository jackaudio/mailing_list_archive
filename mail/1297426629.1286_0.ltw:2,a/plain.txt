I've built a daemon, responsible of keeping track of connections from audio 
capture sources to audio playback devices. Basically, the daemon connects to 
jack, activates the client, and keeps listening for port registrations - then 
connects the ports to the relevant playback ports, as needed.
I also have the need to know it as soon as the ports have been registered - if 
possible - because I have to answer very quickly to a connection request.



Therefore I need to know when the client is ready to get connected, and to 
know it asap.. What could I do?



PS Another detail - you need to activate the client (using jack_activate() ) 
*before* you start registering ports, or can you do that before activation?
