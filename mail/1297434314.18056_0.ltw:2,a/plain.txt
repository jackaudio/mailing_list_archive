In both log I see:

ALSA: could not complete playback of 2048 frames: error = -32
JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync: write error, stopping...

So basically ALSA driver stopped completely, so:

1) can you provide a log with dummy driver, since it should behave differently?

2) Backend error handling logic was changed in http://trac.jackaudio.org/changeset/4079, but the log shows that a serious non-revoverable error was detected in ALSA driver... maybe the change in r 4079 is still not correct.

3) I see that jackd is started in synchronous mode (-S), can you try without -S (asynchronous mode) and send the log?
