OK.

Well the old code was more "relaxed' since an ALSA backend Read/Write error (-1 code) was just handled as a "skipped cycle", then the error handling code *inside* the ALSA driver was changed a bit so that "recoverable" ALSA error would be handled internally in the backend and not returned in the JackAudioDriver layer.

But is seems something goes really wrong in your ALSA backend, does JACK1 behaves better in the same situation?

This continuous message  "ALSA XRun wait_status" basically says that the ALSA driver is in a bad state again....
