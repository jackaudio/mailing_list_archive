&gt; &gt;You've established that these files are different. I think we accept
&gt; &gt;that it would be better if there was a single set of header files used
&gt; &gt;by all implementations of JACK. I'm not sure the best way to approach
&gt; &gt;this goal.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, I didn't mean that to be argumentative... rather it confirmed
&gt; the assertions that "it's not /that/ bad."

most of that diff is jack2 lacking JACK_OPTIONAL_WEAK_EXPORT stuff.
this stuff already exists in svn.

please dont do this with a year old versions of the codebase.
here is a git diff -w  of that set with pretty recent versions:

http://pastebin.com/kcNRrgSc

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, the point (which I see has been taken) is that I don't foresee
&gt; &gt;&gt;the libjack1 and libjack2 thing going away as long as Jack1 and Jack2
&gt; &gt;&gt;each provide libjack.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't agree that this is clear at all. I can build jack1 and jack2
&gt; &gt;on my system. I can install one, run a JACK app, quit, uninstall that
&gt; &gt;version, install the other, and run the same JACK app. Why would
&gt; &gt;anyone sanely call the two libraries libjack1 and libjack2 when there
&gt; &gt;are (and have long been) shared object versioning systems for *nix
&gt; 
&gt; ...except that, as soon as they switch to Jack2 Debian had a JACK
&gt; ABI breakage with a few apps.

it was a bug. but this has been discussed to death already.

i am working on a patch, which stops libjack1 from leaking internal
symbols. maybe this nitpicking will stop then.

it would still be nice, if we could get the headers into a deeper sync.
i dont like the idea of a separate repository for the headerfiles
though.
does somebody have a better idea ?
maybe a script which checks the headers, and mails diffs to the ML or
somthing ?
