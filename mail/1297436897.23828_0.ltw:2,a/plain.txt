most of that diff is jack2 lacking JACK_OPTIONAL_WEAK_EXPORT stuff.
this stuff already exists in svn.

please dont do this with a year old versions of the codebase.
here is a git diff -w  of that set with pretty recent versions:

it was a bug. but this has been discussed to death already.

i am working on a patch, which stops libjack1 from leaking internal
symbols. maybe this nitpicking will stop then.

it would still be nice, if we could get the headers into a deeper sync.
i dont like the idea of a separate repository for the headerfiles
though.
does somebody have a better idea ?
maybe a script which checks the headers, and mails diffs to the ML or
somthing ?
