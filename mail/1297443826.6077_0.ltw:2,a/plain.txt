This may be superfluous to this thread... (please advise, if so)... I 
sent several messages recently to this list regarding my problem with 
audio (& Jack) upon a very recent Debian Squeeze "upgrade (of which Jack 
was one of), & I tried some of the several suggestions offered (thanks 
for those), with out any luck in resolving the problems I'm having 
(others may be having similar problems, I'm guessing, but perhaps not?).

I have tried to decipher this present discussion... I use Jack1. I know 
from a past experience that Jack2 requires a rebuild of programs that 
use Jack.  Question is; instead of trying (presently) to trouble shoot 
my installation of  Jack1/Alsa... or whatever, I might have an easier 
time of it in the long run (Jack2 is probably the need to do at some 
point or another): How can I install Jack2...  do I need to uninstall 
Jack1? I ask this, because some of the discussion on this thread, seemed 
to indicate the possibility some programs are not compatible, somehow, 
with Jack2.

I'd be more than happy if there was a link to a reference on the matter.

Thanks much.

Henry

P.s., will Alsa, & my drivers (Echo, Mia card) need to be rebuilt?
