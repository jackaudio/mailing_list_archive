If i set "unlimited" on my laptop (32bit machine), what is described
above can and does happen. Although, in my case - I think it might be
due to the odd mis-behaving VST (wine-rt) application.  but if i set
an actual limit for memlock ~ it never freezes/lockups, or anything
annoying like that.

i would also like to know the answer to that question, i am curious
about this....

i know from problems I had in the past - I now choose to never set
memlock unlimited.  I would rather
have a limit set, and have the piece of mind that comes with it.
that's just my experience (and opinion) though.
