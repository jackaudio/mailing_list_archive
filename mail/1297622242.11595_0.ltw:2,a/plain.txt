Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack_bufsize callbacks during jack_activate

hi...

in order to avoid the race conditions with a buffersize change between
jack_client_open() and jack_activate() we are sending out a bufsize
callback during jack_activate()

i think its the right move. but there is no way to detect, whether the
implementation in use is doing this.

i also delayed the attachment of the buffer segment until
jack_activate(). the result is undefined behaviour when calling
jack_port_get_buffer() on an inactive client.

i am now seeing a few problems popping up. so it might make sense to
revert these changes.
anybody got an opinion on it ?
