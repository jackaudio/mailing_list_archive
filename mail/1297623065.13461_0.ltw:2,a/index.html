&gt; Hi again...
&gt; 
&gt; I gave it a try and made a first proof-of-concept JACK wrapper. The JACK
&gt; clients I made so far all compile and run nicely with it. However I
&gt; stumbled upon some things in the JACK API which are not quite clear to
&gt; me from the documentation. Maybe you can help me with those?
&gt; 
&gt; - The function jack_port_disconnect(jack_client_t*, jack_port_t*) makes
&gt; me wonder what it should really do. The documentation doesn't help me,
&gt; because it says it performs the same function as jack_disconnect(), but
&gt; I can't see how it could with those parameters...?
&gt; 
&gt; - jack_port_type_id_t jack_port_type_id(const jack_port_t *port):
&gt; This is totally unclear to me. It seems to be in my JACK header but it's
&gt; not in the online documentation. Probably I can just ignore that?
&gt; 
&gt; - jack_port_get_total_latency(jack_client_t*, jack_port_t*):
&gt; The semantics of this is not quite clear to me. Would I be correct to
&gt; assume that (given none of my wrapped clients introduce any latency) I
&gt; could just call this on my wrapper client's input and output ports and
&gt; take the maximum of all?
&gt; 
&gt; - Can there only be one error/info function at the same time? It seems
&gt; so to me...
&gt; 
&gt; - Regarding MIDI buffers: how large are these typically? Currently I
&gt; make them the same size as the audio buffers (i.e.,
&gt; sizeof(jack_default_audio_t) * nframes bytes)...
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from that, if there is any interest in this subject I could try to
&gt; compile that stuff into some little library for those who would like to
&gt; test it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Not the whole JACK API is implemented right now, though. What is not
&gt; supported yet:
&gt; - anything regarding latency (I just return 0 latency in any related
&gt; function)
&gt; - anything regarding monitoring (I guess this has no place in a wrapper
&gt; anyway)
&gt; - port lookup using regular expressions (didn't look for a low-footprint
&gt; regex-lib here yet)
&gt; - setting error and info handlers (wouldn't make sense anyway if there
&gt; could be only one of each at any time)
&gt; - some callbacks are not called yet (only client and port (un-)register,
&gt; connection and process callbacks so far)
&gt; - port types other than the default MIDI and audio types
&gt; - port aliases
&gt; 
&gt; Also, all wrapped clients are running in the same process thread
&gt; (because they are considered one single client by the JACK server). The
&gt; wrapper client currently also supports only one audio input and output
&gt; as well as one MIDI input/output.
&gt; 
&gt; And the last limitation: of course you can't use any JACK control app to
&gt; make the connections between the wrapped clients. They have to be done
&gt; programmatically. Well, in theory you could link e.g. patchage to the
&gt; JACK wrapper and use it for all wrapped connections, but this seems a
&gt; bit too much effort :-).
&gt; 
&gt; But like I said: proof of concept...

hmm... interesting. 
how are you doing the graph sort ?

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
