I thought about using some graph library first (like from boost), but as
of now I just have a VERY simple proprietary graph structure.

The graph is not really ordered, but execution follows a simple
depth-first search: if some client's input is connected to another
client's output, process that client first... Yes I know it does not
allow for cycles :-) (which I forgot to add to the list of what is not
supported yet). Depth-first search is started at some arbitrary
yet-unprocessed client, after that is finished, another arbitrary
unprocessed client is taken, until all clients have been processed.

I didn't know what is the expected behaviour with graph cycles for JACK,
so I just skipped that for now... can you enlighten me how it is done in
jack1/jack2/tschak?

Cheers,

Arne

P.S.: reminds me that I should probably at least add some kind of check
to avoid making connections which lead to cycles.. :-)

&gt;&gt; Hi again...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I gave it a try and made a first proof-of-concept JACK wrapper. The JACK
&gt;&gt; clients I made so far all compile and run nicely with it. However I
&gt;&gt; stumbled upon some things in the JACK API which are not quite clear to
&gt;&gt; me from the documentation. Maybe you can help me with those?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - The function jack_port_disconnect(jack_client_t*, jack_port_t*) makes
&gt;&gt; me wonder what it should really do. The documentation doesn't help me,
&gt;&gt; because it says it performs the same function as jack_disconnect(), but
&gt;&gt; I can't see how it could with those parameters...?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - jack_port_type_id_t jack_port_type_id(const jack_port_t *port):
&gt;&gt; This is totally unclear to me. It seems to be in my JACK header but it's
&gt;&gt; not in the online documentation. Probably I can just ignore that?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - jack_port_get_total_latency(jack_client_t*, jack_port_t*):
&gt;&gt; The semantics of this is not quite clear to me. Would I be correct to
&gt;&gt; assume that (given none of my wrapped clients introduce any latency) I
&gt;&gt; could just call this on my wrapper client's input and output ports and
&gt;&gt; take the maximum of all?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - Can there only be one error/info function at the same time? It seems
&gt;&gt; so to me...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - Regarding MIDI buffers: how large are these typically? Currently I
&gt;&gt; make them the same size as the audio buffers (i.e.,
&gt;&gt; sizeof(jack_default_audio_t) * nframes bytes)...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Apart from that, if there is any interest in this subject I could try to
&gt;&gt; compile that stuff into some little library for those who would like to
&gt;&gt; test it out.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not the whole JACK API is implemented right now, though. What is not
&gt;&gt; supported yet:
&gt;&gt; - anything regarding latency (I just return 0 latency in any related
&gt;&gt; function)
&gt;&gt; - anything regarding monitoring (I guess this has no place in a wrapper
&gt;&gt; anyway)
&gt;&gt; - port lookup using regular expressions (didn't look for a low-footprint
&gt;&gt; regex-lib here yet)
&gt;&gt; - setting error and info handlers (wouldn't make sense anyway if there
&gt;&gt; could be only one of each at any time)
&gt;&gt; - some callbacks are not called yet (only client and port (un-)register,
&gt;&gt; connection and process callbacks so far)
&gt;&gt; - port types other than the default MIDI and audio types
&gt;&gt; - port aliases
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, all wrapped clients are running in the same process thread
&gt;&gt; (because they are considered one single client by the JACK server). The
&gt;&gt; wrapper client currently also supports only one audio input and output
&gt;&gt; as well as one MIDI input/output.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And the last limitation: of course you can't use any JACK control app to
&gt;&gt; make the connections between the wrapped clients. They have to be done
&gt;&gt; programmatically. Well, in theory you could link e.g. patchage to the
&gt;&gt; JACK wrapper and use it for all wrapped connections, but this seems a
&gt;&gt; bit too much effort :-).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But like I said: proof of concept...
&gt; 
&gt; hmm... interesting. 
&gt; how are you doing the graph sort ?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;
