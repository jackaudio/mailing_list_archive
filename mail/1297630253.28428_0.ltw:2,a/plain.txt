ardour3 seems to be doing it during a reconnect to jack, to determine
the size of jack_midi_port buffers.
we dont seem to have a function which allows to do this without
jack_port_get_buffer()

we should have one probably.
along with this we might change the name of the bufsize callback, to
allow applications to detect the new semantics.

the current bufsize callback is focussed on audio.
but we have 2 different buffersizes which might change.

so maybe we should change the signature of the bufsize callback, and
add a new function:
jack_nframes_t jack_port_type_get_bufsize( const char *port_type ) ???
^^ that should probably be size_t or somthing.

bugs in ardour3, for example.
maybe more clients have problems with this new behaviour.
