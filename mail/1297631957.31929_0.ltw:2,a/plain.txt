yeah. thats the idea.
nothing would change, when another port-type is added.
new_bufsize_cb() wouldnt have arguments, and you would get the actual
numbers with jack_port_type_get_buffersize()...

for audio that doesnt make sense (except multirate audio, or somthing)
for midiports, it would make sense. but no implementation supports this
currently.
