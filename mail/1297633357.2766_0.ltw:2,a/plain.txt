Thanks for the info Joakim.  i had figured that it must be something like this.
Without using memlock unlimited, my wine-rt apps behave correctly (as
do my linux apps)
and i see no downside to setting a limit.

...Not jack2 or tschack though?

I am also wondering;  What is the benefit of having memlock unlimited,
as a default?
especially, when it has the potential to allow a rogue application
to freeze the whole system.
