There could be a use-case for audio-ports with different buffer-sizes. One could 
define ports to have/allow for higher latency and thus bigger buffer-size. Like 
the ports of a long-tail IR. Or the inputs of an oscilloscope/vu-meter.
But the jack would have to gain the ability to multiplex these audio data with 
the one for/from low-latency (aka standard) ports...

Special sysex midi-ports could also be a use-case. Or some future control-
protocol.

The question is: Do we/you want to think ahead that far and make the buffer-
size not port-type specific but port-specific?

Have fun,

Arnold
