the JACK MIDI system was specifically designed to exclude large sysex
messages from the "design goals". however, the recent addition of a
command-line specification for MIDI buffer sizes somewhat takes care
of this (albeit in a somewhat wasteful way if only 1 port is ever
going to deliver huge sysexes).

port sizing is port type specific, so a new control protocol can
provide its own buffer size, either as an absolute size or as a
multiple of the audio buffer size.

I return again to the basic philosophy of JACK's design: we are not
trying to make all things possible. The goal is to provide a system
that makes it as easy as possible to accomplish,oh, lets say 90% of
what anyone could possibly want to do with anything remotely similar
to JACK, and leave the last 10% (mostly corner cases) for skilled
programmers to implement themselves to avoid over-complicating an
already rather complex system (internally) and also to avoid adding
complexity to what is, at core, a very simple API.
