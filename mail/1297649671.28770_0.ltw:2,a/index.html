&gt; &gt; Special sysex midi-ports could also be a use-case. Or some future control-
&gt; &gt; protocol.
&gt; 
&gt; the JACK MIDI system was specifically designed to exclude large sysex
&gt; messages from the "design goals". however, the recent addition of a
&gt; command-line specification for MIDI buffer sizes somewhat takes care
&gt; of this (albeit in a somewhat wasteful way if only 1 port is ever
&gt; going to deliver huge sysexes).
&gt; 
&gt; port sizing is port type specific, so a new control protocol can
&gt; provide its own buffer size, either as an absolute size or as a
&gt; multiple of the audio buffer size.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The question is: Do we/you want to think ahead that far and make the buffer-
&gt; &gt; size not port-type specific but port-specific?
&gt; 
&gt; I return again to the basic philosophy of JACK's design: we are not
&gt; trying to make all things possible. The goal is to provide a system
&gt; that makes it as easy as possible to accomplish,oh, lets say 90% of
&gt; what anyone could possibly want to do with anything remotely similar
&gt; to JACK, and leave the last 10% (mostly corner cases) for skilled
&gt; programmers to implement themselves to avoid over-complicating an
&gt; already rather complex system (internally) and also to avoid adding
&gt; complexity to what is, at core, a very simple API.

this does not cover the initial question.
