The server has a timeout to decide when the graph has really failed before trying to write back in ALSA. Since the server is late, ALSA backend issue a  "ALSA: could not complete playback" error in alsa_driver_write. This is considered as a "non recoverable error" and the backend wrapping thread is just stopped.

OK this makes sense, Valerio here a patch to test that does not write back in the backend if the "graph process" fails:




Can you try is and report?

Thanks
