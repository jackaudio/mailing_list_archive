Subject:     [Jack-Devel] behavior of jack_port_register on activated client?

I am writing a binding for JACK to Haskell.

As part of this process, it would be helpful to know the behavior of
jack_port_register. Will it block until a processing callback is not
running? Is there any sort of mutual exclusion between
jack_port_register and the processing callback? Or do I need to
provide this myself?

If there isn't, is it safe to call it inside a processing callback? If
so, can I use the port immediately, or should I wait for the next
cycle?

Thanks!
