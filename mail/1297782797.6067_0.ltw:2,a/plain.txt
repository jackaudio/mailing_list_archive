you won't get the jack_port_t till it returns. you can't use the
jack_port_t except in either

   * process callback
   * port connections

the process callback and port registration are interlocked, so there's
no problem using it there. the port is valid for connections as soon
as you have the handle.

basically: don't think so hard about this :)
