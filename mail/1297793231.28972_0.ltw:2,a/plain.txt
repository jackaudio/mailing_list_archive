Part (2) only mentioned making it work for the new callback from part (1).

My question was: why not do that for the old-style callback as well?

I tried, but I just don't understand what you mean by this.

The client needs to initialize the values, and it needs a callback
that can reallocate them whenever called. There must be some simple
contradiction I'm missing here.
