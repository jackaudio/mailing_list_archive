&gt;&gt; &gt; this is true EVEN IF the client registered a buffer size callback. why
&gt;&gt; &gt; so? despite the suggestion in the API docs for the buffer size
&gt;&gt; &gt; callback, existing implementations do NOT guarantee to call the
&gt;&gt; &gt; client's buffer size callback from within jack_activate(). this means
&gt;&gt; &gt; that there is no reliable way for a client to know the port buffer
&gt;&gt; &gt; size before its first process callback. the buffer size callback will
&gt;&gt; &gt; notify it of later changes to the size, but not the initial size when
&gt;&gt; &gt; it gets its first process() call.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Perhaps a stupid question: why not ensure the buffer size callback
&gt;&gt; *is* invoked before the first process callback?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is that because it cannot be called in the realtime thread?
&gt;
&gt; how would you detect that its invoked ?

How would the callback know it's been called? I don't understand.

&gt; jack-svn is invoking bufsize callback during jack_activate()
&gt; there is no way, to be sure this happens.

That is the point I'm missing. Why not?

&gt; so currently, one needs to allocate everything. then the bufsize cb will
&gt; come, and results in reallocations. the old signature of the bufsize cb
&gt; also does not allow determining the size of the midi port buffers.

I realize that it was overlooked when MIDI was added. I'm just trying
to understand why it's broken for audio buffers.

&gt; the new functionname allows us do detect whether it will be called via
&gt; weak linking. we are basically solving 2 problems at once.
&gt;
&gt; does it make sense to you now ?

Not quite. But, thanks for trying to explain it.
