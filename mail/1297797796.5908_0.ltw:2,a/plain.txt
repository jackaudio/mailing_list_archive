Hence, the callback needs to reallocate.

That is why I asked: shouldn't JACK invoke the callback before the
first process call? What breaks if it does?

The best the client can do is code it to work if JACK works correctly.

If JACK does not, the best hope is not to change the buffer size.
That's been the de facto solution for the past ten years or so. I
doubt very many JACK clients ever worked correctly with this
interface.
