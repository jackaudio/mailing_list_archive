&gt;&gt; If JACK does not, the best hope is not to change the buffer size.
&gt;&gt; That's been the de facto solution for the past ten years or so. I
&gt;&gt; doubt very many JACK clients ever worked correctly with this
&gt;&gt; interface.
&gt;
&gt; so, if i understand correctly, you are suggesting that we simply
&gt; convert the implementations so that the callback is always called from
&gt; jack_activate(), and tell client authors "you should assume that its
&gt; called from jack_activate(), though it may not be, and that's a bug in
&gt; older versions of JACK" ?

Not exactly. The issue is complex, because one needs to look at it
from both sides. Existing clients will want to work as best they can
with old JACK versions. Removing the initialization code would not
serve that purpose well, despite being subject to a race condition.

I am not against adding new, cleaner interfaces. But, let's not hold
our breath waiting for everyone to adopt them. That takes years.

I was just asking: what's wrong with fixing the bug in the existing one?

I suspect I may have missed some earlier message where that problem
was described already. If so, I apologize.
