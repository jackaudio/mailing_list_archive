Not exactly. The issue is complex, because one needs to look at it
from both sides. Existing clients will want to work as best they can
with old JACK versions. Removing the initialization code would not
serve that purpose well, despite being subject to a race condition.

I am not against adding new, cleaner interfaces. But, let's not hold
our breath waiting for everyone to adopt them. That takes years.

I was just asking: what's wrong with fixing the bug in the existing one?

I suspect I may have missed some earlier message where that problem
was described already. If so, I apologize.
