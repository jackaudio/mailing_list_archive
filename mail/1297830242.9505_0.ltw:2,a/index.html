&gt; &gt;&gt; If JACK does not, the best hope is not to change the buffer size.
&gt; &gt;&gt; That's been the de facto solution for the past ten years or so. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; doubt very many JACK clients ever worked correctly with this
&gt; &gt;&gt; interface.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so, if i understand correctly, you are suggesting that we simply
&gt; &gt; convert the implementations so that the callback is always called from
&gt; &gt; jack_activate(), and tell client authors "you should assume that its
&gt; &gt; called from jack_activate(), though it may not be, and that's a bug in
&gt; &gt; older versions of JACK" ?
&gt; 
&gt; Not exactly. The issue is complex, because one needs to look at it
&gt; from both sides. Existing clients will want to work as best they can
&gt; with old JACK versions. Removing the initialization code would not
&gt; serve that purpose well, despite being subject to a race condition.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not against adding new, cleaner interfaces. But, let's not hold
&gt; our breath waiting for everyone to adopt them. That takes years.
&gt; 
&gt; I was just asking: what's wrong with fixing the bug in the existing one?
&gt; 
&gt; I suspect I may have missed some earlier message where that problem
&gt; was described already. If so, I apologize.

Many jack clients cant handle buffersize changes anyway, mostly because
the jack_set_buffer_size_callback() isn't involved.  

But anyhow, clients witch handle it, and use internal buffers, have
allocate the buffers before they called jack_activate(), so, a change in
buffersize in between this time, leads anyway to a new allocation, when
the client notice the change, isn't it ?  

so wouldn't a call like 

if (!jack_activate(jack_client))
 if(sz != jack_get_buffer_size (jack_client)){buffersize change handle }

handle the race condition without change anything in jack ?
