&gt; &gt; Hi guys; thanks a lot for your invaluable support! The patch,
&gt; &gt; unfortunately, does nothing to fix or even improve the problem, which
&gt; &gt; appears being completely unrelated to killing  clients...
&gt; 
&gt; Well the real problem is that the ALSA backend returns an error (-1) that
&gt; is considered "non recoverable" by the upper layer (the
&gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync function), then the wrapper ALSA backend
&gt; thread is just stopped. When this wrapper thread is not running anymore,
&gt; no client can connect anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the *reason* the ALSA backend returns an error may be caused by several
&gt; different events:
&gt; 
&gt; - either an issue in ALSA backend code (the thing you're trying to debug)
&gt; 
&gt; - or a "late graph" occurrence (for instance by killing a client in
&gt; synchronous mode, that was not correctly handled, the AUDIO_DRIVER.diif
&gt; patch from yesterday was supposed to fix this specific issue.
&gt; 

mmm, ok, i'll try debugging the alsa code. We're convinced there's something 
fishy being done by the hw supplier's ALSA driver.

&gt; &gt; Let me explain. We did never try booting up our ARM box and just leaving
&gt; &gt; JACK running without any clients connected, until yesterday. It happened
&gt; &gt; by chance and we noticed that JACK *was already blocked*! We didn't
&gt; &gt; connect any client to it yet!
&gt; 
&gt; So it means the ALSA backend and/or the interaction with the upper layer
&gt; (the JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync function) still has an issue.
&gt; 

That or JackAudioDriver::ProcessAsync(), am I right?

&gt; &gt; I've tried to better pinpoint the problem, and here's what I've found:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First: ALSA docs specify error codes for some pcm_snd_* functions used by
&gt; &gt; jacks' ALSA driver - that is -EPIPE, -EINTR and -ESTRPIPE - but in a
&gt; &gt; couple occasions you use the defined values without the minus. I've
&gt; &gt; attached a patch, "fix-ALSA-error-codes.patch", to fix this.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, JACK1 has the same issue. I guess this should be fixed in JACK1 ALSA
&gt; backend also (Torben ?)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The actual problem wasn't fixed by this patch so I kept trying and adding
&gt; &gt; debug messages. JACK starts up and hums away until an xrun occurs. As
&gt; &gt; soon as this happens, the driver breaks. The reason is that it tries to
&gt; &gt; perform recovery (by restarting the driver) but it makes no effect
&gt; &gt; because it ends up in an infinite loop within JackAlsaDriver::Read() !
&gt; &gt; There, alsa_driver_wait returns 0, the "goto retry;" runs it again, the
&gt; &gt; xrun code is ran again, and alsa_driver_wait returns 0 again, entering
&gt; &gt; an infinite loop.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm attaching two patches, both with a lot of added log messages (and
&gt; &gt; also the previously explained patch)  to help understand what was going
&gt; &gt; on. The first version ("without-recovery") only adds debugging. A test
&gt; &gt; run with it is linked at Pastebin: http://jackd.pastebin.com/JTswYfLd .
&gt; &gt; the second one also attempts to fix the issue using ALSA's
&gt; &gt; snd_pcm_recover(), and a test run of it is linked here:
&gt; &gt; http://jackd.pastebin.com/2iifw6Gh .
&gt; &gt; With the recovery in place the issue is still present, but seemingly
&gt; &gt; better identifiable, because JackAlsaDriver simply gets stuck within the
&gt; &gt; poll() call in alsa_driver_wait() .
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At the moment this is as far as I've got with the debugging. Do you have
&gt; &gt; any idea or suggestion?
&gt; 
&gt; Not at this time... I would need to go again deep in the ALSA backend.. and
&gt; it's interaction with JackAudioDriver. Not too much time this week. Can we
&gt; work on that next week? We could also do some debugging session o #jack
&gt; channel on Freenode.
&gt;

Of course, I'll try doing this myself in the meantime, and I'll hop on IRC 
right now :)

See you there, thanks a lot again,
