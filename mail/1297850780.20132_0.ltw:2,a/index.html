&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi guys; thanks a lot for your invaluable support! The patch,
&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately, does nothing to fix or even improve the problem, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; appears being completely unrelated to killing  clients...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well the real problem is that the ALSA backend returns an error (-1) that
&gt; &gt; is considered "non recoverable" by the upper layer (the
&gt; &gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync function), then the wrapper ALSA backend
&gt; &gt; thread is just stopped. When this wrapper thread is not running anymore,
&gt; &gt; no client can connect anymore.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now the *reason* the ALSA backend returns an error may be caused by several
&gt; &gt; different events:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - either an issue in ALSA backend code (the thing you're trying to debug)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - or a "late graph" occurrence (for instance by killing a client in
&gt; &gt; synchronous mode, that was not correctly handled, the AUDIO_DRIVER.diif
&gt; &gt; patch from yesterday was supposed to fix this specific issue.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; mmm, ok, i'll try debugging the alsa code. We're convinced there's something fishy being done by the hw supplier's ALSA driver.


Possibly, but since it is working with JACK1 *and* JACK1/JACK2 ALSA backend share something like 99,9% of their code, then the final behaviour difference is probably a slight difference in the interaction with the upper layer (JackAudioDriver class).


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me explain. We did never try booting up our ARM box and just leaving
&gt; &gt; &gt; JACK running without any clients connected, until yesterday. It happened
&gt; &gt; &gt; by chance and we noticed that JACK *was already blocked*! We didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; connect any client to it yet!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So it means the ALSA backend and/or the interaction with the upper layer
&gt; &gt; (the JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync function) still has an issue.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That or JackAudioDriver::ProcessAsync(), am I right?

No: JackAudioDriver::ProcessAsync() is used when the server runs in "asynchronous" mode (default mode) and JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync() is used when the the server runs in "synchronous" mode (with -S)

As Torben explained in a previous mail, in "synchronous " mode, the server should not write back in the driver if the "graph is late". This is the way JACK1 works and I changed JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync()  in the AUDIO_DRIVER.diff patch to have the same behaviour now in JACK2.

&gt; 
&gt; Of course, I'll try doing this myself in the meantime, and I'll hop on IRC right now :)
&gt; 
Ok, next week only for me.
