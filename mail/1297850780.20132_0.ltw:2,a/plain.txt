Possibly, but since it is working with JACK1 *and* JACK1/JACK2 ALSA backend share something like 99,9% of their code, then the final behaviour difference is probably a slight difference in the interaction with the upper layer (JackAudioDriver class).

No: JackAudioDriver::ProcessAsync() is used when the server runs in "asynchronous" mode (default mode) and JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync() is used when the the server runs in "synchronous" mode (with -S)

As Torben explained in a previous mail, in "synchronous " mode, the server should not write back in the driver if the "graph is late". This is the way JACK1 works and I changed JackAudioDriver::ProcessSync()  in the AUDIO_DRIVER.diff patch to have the same behaviour now in JACK2.

Ok, next week only for me.
