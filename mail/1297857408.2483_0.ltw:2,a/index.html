&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this is true EVEN IF the client registered a buffer size callback. why
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so? despite the suggestion in the API docs for the buffer size
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; callback, existing implementations do NOT guarantee to call the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; client's buffer size callback from within jack_activate(). this means
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that there is no reliable way for a client to know the port buffer
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; size before its first process callback. the buffer size callback will
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; notify it of later changes to the size, but not the initial size when
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it gets its first process() call.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps a stupid question: why not ensure the buffer size callback
&gt; &gt;&gt; *is* invoked before the first process callback?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Is that because it cannot be called in the realtime thread?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; how would you detect that its invoked ?
&gt; 
&gt; How would the callback know it's been called? I don't understand.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; jack-svn is invoking bufsize callback during jack_activate()
&gt; &gt; there is no way, to be sure this happens.
&gt; 
&gt; That is the point I'm missing. Why not?

because you dont know, which version your binary is linked to ?
with the new semantics, you just do all your buffer allocations in the
bufsize callback.

no need to preallocate buffers.

------------------------------------------

float *buffer = NULL;
jack_client_t *client;

void bufsize_cb( void * arg )
{
  buffer = realloc (buffer, jack_port_type_get_bufsize( client, JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE ));
}

void old_bufsize_cb( jack_nframes_t nframes, void * arg )
{
  buffer = realloc (buffer, nframes * sizeof(float) );
}

int main()
{
  client = jack_client_open( "bla", ... );

  if (jack_set_bufsize_changed_cb) {
     jack_set_bufsize_changed_cb( client, bufsize_cb, NULL);
  } else {
     // with the old semantics, we need:
     buffer = malloc (jack_get_bufsize() * sizeof(float) );
     // if we omit this, buffer will not be allocated, and process_cb would
     // crash on using it.
     jack_set_bufsize_callback (client, old_bufsize);
  }

  jack_set_process_cb();


  jack_activate();

  sleep(-1);
}

------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; so currently, one needs to allocate everything. then the bufsize cb will
&gt; &gt; come, and results in reallocations. the old signature of the bufsize cb
&gt; &gt; also does not allow determining the size of the midi port buffers.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize that it was overlooked when MIDI was added. I'm just trying
&gt; to understand why it's broken for audio buffers.

we are approaching API 1.0 ... this api should be as clean as possible.
allocating mem only to reallocate it a few moments afterwards does not
seem clean to me.

the problem is that the only valid point to use jack_get_bufsize() is
inside a bufsize callback. all other points pose a race condition.

declaring new semantics for jack_get_bufsize() seems wrong.
they will go unnoticed for a very long time.
if we deprecate jack_get_bufsize() and introduce a new function,
programmers are more likely to look at the docs for the new function,
and do the bufsize dance ;)


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the new functionname allows us do detect whether it will be called via
&gt; &gt; weak linking. we are basically solving 2 problems at once.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; does it make sense to you now ?
&gt; 
&gt; Not quite. But, thanks for trying to explain it.
