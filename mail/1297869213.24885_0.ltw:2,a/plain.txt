Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] buffer size callback, revisit

On a sidenote:

The JACK API documentation states for the buffer size callback, that it
is called in a "separate non RT thread", i.e., not in the process
thread. Which sounds to me that the process callback and the buffer size
callback can run in parallel.

Is this really the case? It means you'd have to allocate new buffers and
then somehow send those to the process thread in a lock-free way...?
What if the process callback has already been called with the new buffer
size, while the other thread is still reallocating the buffers?

I'm asking because the wrapper lib I'm working on is one of the cases
where I really need to know the buffer size...

Cheers,

Arne
