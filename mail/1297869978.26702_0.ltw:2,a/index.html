Ok, my bad... I was reading the jack.h header from JACK 1.9.6, it seems
to differ from the one at jackaudio.org. Probably just a
copy/paste-thing. After the paragraph you mentioned there is another one
in that header file:

&gt; All "notification events" are received in a seperated non RT thread,
&gt; the code in the supplied function does not need to be
&gt; suitable for real-time execution.

I will just stop reading that header :-).

Cheers,

Arne

&gt;&gt; The JACK API documentation states for the buffer size callback, that it
&gt;&gt; is called in a "separate non RT thread", i.e., not in the process
&gt;&gt; thread. Which sounds to me that the process callback and the buffer size
&gt;&gt; callback can run in parallel.
&gt; 
&gt; where are you reading this? the docs at jackaudio.org state:
&gt; 
&gt;    Tell JACK to call bufsize_callback whenever the size of the the
&gt; buffer that will be passed to the
&gt;    process_callback is about to change. Clients that depend on knowing
&gt; the buffer size must
&gt;    supply a bufsize_callback before activating themselves.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is this really the case? It means you'd have to allocate new buffers and
&gt;&gt; then somehow send those to the process thread in a lock-free way...?
&gt;&gt; What if the process callback has already been called with the new buffer
&gt;&gt; size, while the other thread is still reallocating the buffers?
&gt; 
&gt; this sounds like an artifact of jack2 calling everything (?) but the
&gt; process callback from a 2nd non-RT client thread. if it does this,
&gt; then its wrong, in the sense that as you noted, its unworkable. buffer
&gt; size changes and the process callback MUST be synchronous, i think.
