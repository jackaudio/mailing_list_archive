Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] buffer size callback, revisit

Ok, my bad... I was reading the jack.h header from JACK 1.9.6, it seems
to differ from the one at jackaudio.org. Probably just a
copy/paste-thing. After the paragraph you mentioned there is another one
in that header file:

I will just stop reading that header :-).

Cheers,

Arne
