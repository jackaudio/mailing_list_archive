&gt; Seems like changing modes is actually a special case of graph change,
&gt; where the graph changes but the connected ports do not change.

its a latency recalculation. 
a graph change just includes a latency recalculation.

&gt; 
&gt; Would it be reasonable for applications to ignore it by default, but tell
&gt; jack that the graph changed in cases where the app cares?  In the given
&gt; example, Ardour would decide whether it mattered or not, and if it did
&gt; call to jack to say "the graph changed, recalculate."  Other apps would
&gt; not care, so they would never make the call.

we are finding an answer to whether ardour should tell jack whether the
latencies changed. thats what we are talking about.

&gt; 
&gt; When you say expensive, what kind of time are you talking about?  Going
&gt; from playback to record takes a couple of clicks, so if you are talking
&gt; seconds it would annoy a user, if you are talking tenths of a second it
&gt; might not be noticeable.

we are talking about microseconds. highly unlikely that it takes a
milisecond.

&gt; 
&gt; Is part of the concern that it would cause clicks on jack 1, or that for
&gt; large configurations the recalculation time scales with the graph size, so
&gt; it might not bother me with a handful of tracks, but it would definitely
&gt; bother someone with lots of tracks and dozens of soft synths connected?

it might cause a click. it involves locking the graph.
