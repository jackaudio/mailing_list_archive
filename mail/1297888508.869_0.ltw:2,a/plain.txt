its a latency recalculation. 
a graph change just includes a latency recalculation.

we are finding an answer to whether ardour should tell jack whether the
latencies changed. thats what we are talking about.

we are talking about microseconds. highly unlikely that it takes a
milisecond.

it might cause a click. it involves locking the graph.
