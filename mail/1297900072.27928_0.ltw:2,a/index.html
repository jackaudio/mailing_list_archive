&gt; Consider Ardour. When &#xA0;a track in Ardour is in playback mode, its

&gt; input ports are completely irrelevant. In playback mode, the track
&gt; effectively has a set of output ports that should be marked
&gt; JackPortIsTerminal to indicate that the audio data available there
&gt; does not originate anywhere else in the JACK graph.
&gt; 
&gt; But now switch the track into recording mode, with monitoring enabled.
&gt; What appears at the track's output ports is now totally dependent on
&gt; the connections to the track's input ports. The track is no longer
&gt; functioning as a synth or file playback engine, but instead is more
&gt; like a passthru FX unit. Its output ports are definitely not
&gt; "Terminal" - all data presented at the outputs comes from the inputs.
&gt;
&gt; ... 
&gt; 
&gt; So the question is: should anything be done about this? Should ardour
&gt; force a recompute of the latencies when a track changes modes? This is
&gt; quite expensive and definitely non-RT in jack1; its doable with
&gt; tschak. jack2 does not have an implementation of this latency API yet.
&gt; Could we just redefine the latency specifications into something that
&gt; is still useful, but avoids this issue? Or something else?

I'd say that, considering the external context, it is a non-issue.

To avoid more confusion, I'll avoid the unqualified term 'monitoring'
as this could mean a lot of different things, and instead use:

'performer monitoring' (PM) : the signal of a performer's voice or
instrument sent to the performer while recording that same voice or
instrument.

'track monitoring' (TM) : the signal of already recorderd tracks 
listened to by a performer while adding new tracks to a session or
punching existing tracks.

'control room monitoring (CRM) : what you listen to in a control
room that is acoustically isolated from the space used by the
performers.

There are two cases to consider:

1. 'monitoring done by hardware'. This means either a sound card's
'zero latency mixer' or a 'real' mixer are used for PM. No latency
issues exist for the performer in that case: he/she will just sync
to the TM. ** As far as the performer is concerned, there is no 
signal going through Ardour **. His new signal goes in, but does
not return to him/her via Ardour. The signals that originate in
Ardour do not return to it.

Of course Ardour itself must be aware of the latencies, and the net
result should be that any new recorded signal must be offset w.r.t.
the already existing ones by the round-trip latency - that will make
then synchronous when played back together later. If Ardour already
compensates for playback latency on the tracks that are being played,
then it should compensate for input latency on the tracks being
recorded - the sum of the two should be round-trip. But it still means
two separate signal paths that each can operate without knowing the
other one. In other words, the input latency compensation can *always*
be done, regardless if the recording is of original tracks or dubbing.

2. 'monitoring done by Ardour'. This in fact means that either the
latencies are low enough to be of no consequence, OR there can be no
PM at all. Otherwise the situation is the same as for 1).

There is a deeper underlying problem with Ardour's current architecture,
and it may welll be the original cause of the question you raise. This
is that IF there is separate CRM (e.g. the case of classic studio with
separate spaces for the performers and the sound engineeer), you in 
fact want both 'monitoring by hardware' and 'monitoring via Ardour'
at the same time. 

For the control room, 'monitoring via Ardour' is the ideal situation,
it means that the sound engineer can adjust his mix while recording
new tracks, and nothing changes when later these tracks become part
of the set being played back while eventually recording new ones.
It's the equivalent of what was done in the days of magnetic tape
multitracks: listening to existing tracks via the recording head,
and new track using the signal being recorded, with the tape machine
switching automatically between these in function of the record 
status of each track. The difference is that in the old days you
could use the signal being recorded for PM as well, as there was
no latency on it.

For the performer, you want PM in hardware with no latency, but TM
of course has to come from Ardour. But TM should consist only of the
already recorded tracks - not including the ones being recorded. 
If you have a soundcard with at least as many channels as you have
tracks this can be done using the soundcard's mixer or an external
hardware one. But in the other, more common case, you need a mix for
TM that is not the same one as the one for CRM (whithout the new 
tracks being recorded), and this is atm possible but not really
practical to do with Ardour.
