The server has a timeout to decide when the graph has really failed before trying to write back in ALSA. Since the server is late, ALSA backend issue a  "ALSA: could not complete playback" error in alsa_driver_write. This is considered as a "non recoverable error" and the backend wrapping thread is just stopped.

while you're at it: Would it be unreasonable to ask looking into
ignoring device disconnect?  f.i. have jackd survive and not crash when
an interface (eg ALSA-USB) goes away.

No further action should be taken by JACK (well, maybe some hook-script
could be invoked or a d-bus command send); some 3rd party software could
issue d-bus commands to switch backends.
