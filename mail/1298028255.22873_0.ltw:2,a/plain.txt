The server has a timeout to decide when the graph has really failed before trying to write back in ALSA. Since the server is late, ALSA backend issue a  "ALSA: could not complete playback" error in alsa_driver_write. This is considered as a "non recoverable error" and the backend wrapping thread is just stopped.

i basically did this with tschack. using pyjackd this should be working.
not well tested, as i dont have an usb soundcard with me very often.
