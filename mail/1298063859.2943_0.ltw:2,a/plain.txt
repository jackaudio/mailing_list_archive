Subject:     [Jack-Devel] How to sync non-audio actions to JACK audio?

Hi again,

here's another question for a better understanding of JACK.

I want to sync non-audio actions as sample accurate as possible to a 
sound file. For example, video playback or as in my case, I want to 
trigger some actions via OSC (Open Sound Control) instead of MIDI.

Say, my process() callback has just written N audio frames to an output 
buffer. I want to call some function as exactly as possible when frame 
number n  (with 0 < = n <= N) is "played". When is frame number n 
actually  "played" after process() was called? What means are there in 
the JACK API to sync external non-audio actions to audio? Are there some 
examples for best practices?

Kind regards,

Felix
