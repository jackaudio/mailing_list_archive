I've updated jackdmp and tschack to latest svn/git and check this with a
USB UA-25. annotated logs attached.


	tschack (git 7b7a48d)
terminates with exit 0 if the interface goes away.


	jack2d 1.9.7~svn4120 ( --classic --dbus )
keeps running when the USB/ALSA interface goes away - it no longer
live-locks or crashes. - All JACK clients stall.
With the dbus-version: the backend can be changed. After switching to a
new backend (here: internal card) JACK resumes to run nicely.

After the device had been disconnected, the current port-connections can
no longer be queried (jack_lsp can not connect) until the backend is
re-initialized with `jack_control sm`.
Calling 'switch-master' re-creates the physical output ports and the
information about previous port-connections to the outputs are lost.



Anyway, to come back to the Subject:

svn rev 4119: "Valerio Pilo second CAS for ARMv7 patch." introduces a
problem with jackdbus. All requests time out and it is not possible to
connect to jackdbus at all:
  "JackEngine::ClientActivate wait error ref = 2 name = dbusapi"

reverting the notification behavior in JackEngine.cpp removes that
problem. I assume you may know what's going on; I've just bisected and
not analyzed it.

ciao,
robin
