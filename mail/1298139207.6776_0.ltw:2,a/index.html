&gt; &gt;&gt; while you're at it: Would it be unreasonable to ask looking into 
&gt; &gt;&gt; ignoring device disconnect?  f.i. have jackd survive and not crash
&gt; &gt;&gt; when an interface (eg ALSA-USB) goes away.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; No further action should be taken by JACK (well, maybe some
&gt; &gt;&gt; hook-script could be invoked or a d-bus command send); some 3rd
&gt; &gt;&gt; party software could issue d-bus commands to switch backends.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i basically did this with tschack. using pyjackd this should be
&gt; &gt; working. not well tested, as i dont have an usb soundcard with me
&gt; &gt; very often.
&gt; 
&gt; I've updated jackdmp and tschack to latest svn/git and check this with a
&gt; USB UA-25. annotated logs attached.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	tschack (git 7b7a48d)
&gt; terminates with exit 0 if the interface goes away.

you did not use pyjackd.
the jackd binary that comes with tschack is supposed to behave excactly
like a jackd binary should.
i didnt add a callback to the control api yet. but pyjackd should be
ignoring the SIGUSR2 thats sent to the process leader upon backend exit.

so it probably wont exit.
the behaviour of tschack while it doesnt have a backend, is probably not
really nice. (there are places where it waits for a graph switch) 
this is definitely fixable though.


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	jack2d 1.9.7~svn4120 ( --classic --dbus )
&gt; keeps running when the USB/ALSA interface goes away - it no longer
&gt; live-locks or crashes. - All JACK clients stall.
&gt; With the dbus-version: the backend can be changed. After switching to a
&gt; new backend (here: internal card) JACK resumes to run nicely.
&gt; 
&gt; After the device had been disconnected, the current port-connections can
&gt; no longer be queried (jack_lsp can not connect) until the backend is
&gt; re-initialized with `jack_control sm`.
&gt; Calling 'switch-master' re-creates the physical output ports and the
&gt; information about previous port-connections to the outputs are lost.

loss of port-connections is to be expected. its a backend switch.
the ports might be different. recreating the correct connections, should
be done by some kind of sessionmanager. this is out of scope for jackd.
