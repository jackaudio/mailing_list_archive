you did not use pyjackd.
the jackd binary that comes with tschack is supposed to behave excactly
like a jackd binary should.
i didnt add a callback to the control api yet. but pyjackd should be
ignoring the SIGUSR2 thats sent to the process leader upon backend exit.

so it probably wont exit.
the behaviour of tschack while it doesnt have a backend, is probably not
really nice. (there are places where it waits for a graph switch) 
this is definitely fixable though.

loss of port-connections is to be expected. its a backend switch.
the ports might be different. recreating the correct connections, should
be done by some kind of sessionmanager. this is out of scope for jackd.
