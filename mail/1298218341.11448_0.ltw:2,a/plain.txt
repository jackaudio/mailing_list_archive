Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

I have sent some several messages regarding a problem with sound on my 
Debian Squeeze set-up *after* a massive recent "upgrade;" no resolution 
so far. I have been doing some sniffing around in my system & I 
discovered, via the Synaptic Package Manager that it appears I have some 
different versions of 'jack' installed:

jackd   (version 5)
jackd1 (version 1:0.118+svn3796-8)
jackd1-firewire (version 1:0.118+svn3796-8)

I have been (appropriately or not) been admonished several times in the 
past, that multiple versions of 'jack' are *not* OK.  I did not install 
the firewire version for sure... as I do not use firewire (I have a echo 
mia sound card... & it was working fine before the above mentioned 
upgrade... & historically speaking, I had a 'jackd2' install at an 
upgrade... & removing it allowed me to have audio function once again).

Please advise (perhaps these versions work together?).

Thanks much.

Henry
