hallo,
those are not different versions.
&gt;
&gt; jackd   (version 5)
this is only a pseudo package. just keep it.
&gt; jackd1 (version 1:0.118+svn3796-8)
this is the actually jackd package, keep it for sure.
&gt; jackd1-firewire (version 1:0.118+svn3796-8)
this is the fw part, you only need if you are using fw. perhaps you can 
simple remove it, but i do not think that your problem is here.

how are you starting jackd? are you using qjackctl for that?

cheers,
doc
&gt;
&gt; I have been (appropriately or not) been admonished several times in 
&gt; the past, that multiple versions of 'jack' are *not* OK.  I did not 
&gt; install the firewire version for sure... as I do not use firewire (I 
&gt; have a echo mia sound card... &amp; it was working fine before the above 
&gt; mentioned upgrade... &amp; historically speaking, I had a 'jackd2' install 
&gt; at an upgrade... &amp; removing it allowed me to have audio function once 
&gt; again).
&gt;
&gt; Please advise (perhaps these versions work together?).
&gt;
&gt; Thanks much.
