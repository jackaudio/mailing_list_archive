Thanks for reply.

Yes, I use 'qjackctl' to start 'jack,' that is, (usually) unless the 
audio/midi program does it for me...  (Rosegarden, Ardour, etc.). &amp; a 
strange thing to me, is that if I load 'ZynAddSubFX,' I can get 'jack' 
to start up, &amp; midi to function (record/play), but no audio.

I removed the 'fw' version of jackd, &amp; you were correct, this did not 
solve the problem.

I sent this before, but I'll send the out put from 'qjackctl' from when 
I try to start 'jack' from it:

It appears that the "driver alsa module" will not load. I have been 
checking my alsa configurations (I have now a file with my alsa system 
info, I can send if it may seem relevant).


One other matter has occurred to me, my system did a 'fsck' this morning 
after 24 boots... &amp; came up with some errors that I do not remember 
seeing before... (could there be a bug via the "upgrade" someplace else 
that effects this situation? I think there is a log some place in this 
regard, but do not remember how to access it (?)).


To be clear, I had functioning sound until this "upgrade."

&gt; hallo,
&gt; those are not different versions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; jackd   (version 5)
&gt; this is only a pseudo package. just keep it.
&gt;&gt; jackd1 (version 1:0.118+svn3796-8)
&gt; this is the actually jackd package, keep it for sure.
&gt;&gt; jackd1-firewire (version 1:0.118+svn3796-8)
&gt; this is the fw part, you only need if you are using fw. perhaps you 
&gt; can simple remove it, but i do not think that your problem is here.
&gt;
&gt; how are you starting jackd? are you using qjackctl for that?
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt; doc
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have been (appropriately or not) been admonished several times in 
&gt;&gt; the past, that multiple versions of 'jack' are *not* OK.  I did not 
&gt;&gt; install the firewire version for sure... as I do not use firewire (I 
&gt;&gt; have a echo mia sound card... &amp; it was working fine before the above 
&gt;&gt; mentioned upgrade... &amp; historically speaking, I had a 'jackd2' 
&gt;&gt; install at an upgrade... &amp; removing it allowed me to have audio 
&gt;&gt; function once again).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please advise (perhaps these versions work together?).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks much.
