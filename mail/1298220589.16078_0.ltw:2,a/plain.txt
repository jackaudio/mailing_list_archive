Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

Thanks for reply.

Yes, I use 'qjackctl' to start 'jack,' that is, (usually) unless the 
audio/midi program does it for me...  (Rosegarden, Ardour, etc.). & a 
strange thing to me, is that if I load 'ZynAddSubFX,' I can get 'jack' 
to start up, & midi to function (record/play), but no audio.

I removed the 'fw' version of jackd, & you were correct, this did not 
solve the problem.

I sent this before, but I'll send the out put from 'qjackctl' from when 
I try to start 'jack' from it:

It appears that the "driver alsa module" will not load. I have been 
checking my alsa configurations (I have now a file with my alsa system 
info, I can send if it may seem relevant).


One other matter has occurred to me, my system did a 'fsck' this morning 
after 24 boots... & came up with some errors that I do not remember 
seeing before... (could there be a bug via the "upgrade" someplace else 
that effects this situation? I think there is a log some place in this 
regard, but do not remember how to access it (?)).


To be clear, I had functioning sound until this "upgrade."
