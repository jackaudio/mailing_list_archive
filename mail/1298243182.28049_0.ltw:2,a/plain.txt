In-Reply-To: Felix Homann [Jack-Devel] How to sync non-audio actions to JACK audio? (1298063859.2943_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] How to sync non-audio actions to JACK audio?

You can use a ringbuffer to trigger events outside the jack processing
thread (see the jack examples for ringbuffer usage). If you are using SDL
you can just push events to its main processing thread.

As for video, at 60fps thats 16ms per frame, jack processing callback should
be under 10ms usually, so that gives you ample time to manipulate video.
You can calculate which frame to display or something like that in the
processing callback and communicate this with other threads via a ringbuffer
(if sending video commands like play, position), or just writing to a
currentFrame type variable, which you read when displaying video (in another
thread).

This is more of a threading implementation thing, if you're using SDL you
should be ok:)
