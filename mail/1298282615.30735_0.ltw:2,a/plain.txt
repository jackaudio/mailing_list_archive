The thing is that the POSIX jack implementations (Linux and OSX) use "pthread_t" type and this type appears in the public jack headers. Then the "pthread_t" type has to be defined for Windows, and the jack/systemdeps.h is supposed to define it only if not yet defined....

So this seems to fail.... Have you included "pthread.h" *before* "jack.h"?
