Awesome work Robin, thanks for the tip. Will be testing later in the week!

Hey, looks interesting! 
Can some of the internals be used for suspending / resuming jack based systems ? I was thinking whether one could switch to the dummy backend (which would mirror the exact same port connectivity as the real backend is using if this dummy backend can be told to declare X number of fake ports), then suspend or even turn off the real audio device (like an RME HDSP which does not wake up gracefully), and then suspend the jack session. 
At resume time, the real audio device would be turned on again, the jack backend switching would then kick in to restore the session with this device.

J.
