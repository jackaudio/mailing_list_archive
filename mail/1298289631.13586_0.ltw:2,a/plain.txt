on the long run jack api should not contain a reference to pthread_t
i suggest changing it to jack_native_thread_t or somthing.

this doesnt completely solve the problem. but it should get us almost
there.
jack_native_thread_t would be HANDLE on windows.
how to map a pthreads-win32 pthread_t to a HANDLE might be the problem
we need to solve afterwards. 
but this is an application specific problem then. and not jacks problem.
