&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while you're at it: Would it be unreasonable to ask looking into 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ignoring device disconnect?  f.i. have jackd survive and not crash
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when an interface (eg ALSA-USB) goes away.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No further action should be taken by JACK (well, maybe some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hook-script could be invoked or a d-bus command send); some 3rd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; party software could issue d-bus commands to switch backends.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; i basically did this with tschack. using pyjackd this should be
&gt;&gt;&gt; working. not well tested, as i dont have an usb soundcard with me
&gt;&gt;&gt; very often.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've updated jackdmp and tschack to latest svn/git and check this with a
&gt;&gt; USB UA-25. annotated logs attached.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 	tschack (git 7b7a48d)
&gt;&gt; terminates with exit 0 if the interface goes away.
&gt; 
&gt; you did not use pyjackd.
&gt; the jackd binary that comes with tschack is supposed to behave excactly
&gt; like a jackd binary should.
&gt; i didnt add a callback to the control api yet. but pyjackd should be
&gt; ignoring the SIGUSR2 thats sent to the process leader upon backend exit.
&gt; 
&gt; so it probably wont exit.
&gt; the behaviour of tschack while it doesnt have a backend, is probably not
&gt; really nice. (there are places where it waits for a graph switch) 
&gt; this is definitely fixable though.

Hi Torben,

mmh. python/jackd.py is not executable. I could neither find a dbus
.service file nor a README and and
http://hochstrom.endofinternet.org/trac/tschack does not tell much about
it either.

How do I launch tschack's dbus control server? Can I do so in a sandbox
or chroot (1)?

with jack2, I can use a few symlinks with LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
JACK_DRIVER_DIR to start 'jackdbus auto' and run the whole thing from
the source-tree. This schema only works with tschack's jackd, but not
with jackd.py.


(1) Well.. I don't wanna mess up my main systems and a VM is not good
for testing physical-sound I/O.


&gt;&gt; 	jack2d 1.9.7~svn4120 ( --classic --dbus )
&gt;&gt; keeps running when the USB/ALSA interface goes away - it no longer
&gt;&gt; live-locks or crashes. - All JACK clients stall.
&gt;&gt; With the dbus-version: the backend can be changed. After switching to a
&gt;&gt; new backend (here: internal card) JACK resumes to run nicely.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; After the device had been disconnected, the current port-connections can
&gt;&gt; no longer be queried (jack_lsp can not connect) until the backend is
&gt;&gt; re-initialized with `jack_control sm`.
&gt;&gt; Calling 'switch-master' re-creates the physical output ports and the
&gt;&gt; information about previous port-connections to the outputs are lost.

I found a way around this. jackdbus' org.jackaudio.JackPatchbay
interface keeps an independent internal connection list. It is also much
faster to use this (compared to jack_lsp and jack_connect).
Alas it is/was buggy: http://trac.jackaudio.org/ticket/213

&gt; loss of port-connections is to be expected. its a backend switch.
&gt; the ports might be different. recreating the correct connections, should
&gt; be done by some kind of sessionmanager. this is out of scope for jackd.
&gt; 

indeed. jackd should just signal the condition. Some other tool should
take care of handling the condition (switch backends or not,
re-connect ports or map them depending on the interfaces switched
between...)

If you want to see a prototype in action: http://rg42.org/blog/jack2dbus
The good-news: it works. the bad-news: it's not sth. my mum could
install on her desktop [,yet]. Somehow it also feels from to be
"pioneering" JACK desktop-integration in 2011.

ciao,
robin
