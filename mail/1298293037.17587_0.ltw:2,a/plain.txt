Hi Torben,

mmh. python/jackd.py is not executable. I could neither find a dbus
.service file nor a README and and
http://hochstrom.endofinternet.org/trac/tschack does not tell much about
it either.

How do I launch tschack's dbus control server? Can I do so in a sandbox
or chroot (1)?

with jack2, I can use a few symlinks with LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
JACK_DRIVER_DIR to start 'jackdbus auto' and run the whole thing from
the source-tree. This schema only works with tschack's jackd, but not
with jackd.py.


(1) Well.. I don't wanna mess up my main systems and a VM is not good
for testing physical-sound I/O.

I found a way around this. jackdbus' org.jackaudio.JackPatchbay
interface keeps an independent internal connection list. It is also much
faster to use this (compared to jack_lsp and jack_connect).
Alas it is/was buggy: http://trac.jackaudio.org/ticket/213

indeed. jackd should just signal the condition. Some other tool should
take care of handling the condition (switch backends or not,
re-connect ports or map them depending on the interfaces switched
between...)

If you want to see a prototype in action: http://rg42.org/blog/jack2dbus
The good-news: it works. the bad-news: it's not sth. my mum could
install on her desktop [,yet]. Somehow it also feels from to be
"pioneering" JACK desktop-integration in 2011.

ciao,
robin
