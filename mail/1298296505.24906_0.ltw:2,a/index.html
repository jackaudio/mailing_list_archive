&gt; Awesome work Robin, thanks for the tip. Will be testing later in the
&gt; week! -Harry ------------
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, looks interesting! Can some of the internals be used for
&gt; suspending / resuming jack based systems ?

yes, http://rg42.org/wiki/jack2contol

However, recent work on tschack and jack2 might be more suitable for
handling suspend/resume, YMMV.

&gt; I was thinking whether one
&gt; could switch to the dummy backend (which would mirror the exact same
&gt; port connectivity as the real backend is using if this dummy backend
&gt; can be told to declare X number of fake ports), then suspend or even
&gt; turn off the real audio device (like an RME HDSP which does not wake
&gt; up gracefully), and then suspend the jack session. At resume time,
&gt; the real audio device would be turned on again, the jack backend
&gt; switching would then kick in to restore the session with this
&gt; device.

myjackctl.sh does that exactly.
more specific: /etc/pm/sleep.d/90myjackctl.sh does it using myjackctl.sh




Here's a few quotes from an off-list exchange with Sampo:

&gt; I have one question though: what about switching between cards with
&gt; different amounts of I/O?

myjackctl.sh does not map ports. Currently it only restores the
previous physical port-connections, but it's a simple shell script:
change it to fit your needs.

&gt; Say your RME/whatever gets disconnected and you don't want your
&gt; entire setup to vanish. This mechanism switches you over to your
&gt; builtin sound card, then you find the disconnected cable and plug it
&gt; in. I'd expect to have all connections present, even those from/to
&gt; ports that weren't available when using the internal sound card.

good point. the tool that does the switch will need to remember the last
connection state of _each_ interface. Currently it only remembers _the_
last state - and only very briefly :)

The idea is to go one step further: It should be possible to configure a
set of transition actions for each backend-switch.

&gt; Does this mechanism always switch to a "new" sound interface
&gt; connected to the system, or does it only switch back to the original
&gt; interface jack was started with?

That is configurable.The example-commandline I posted only switches to
THIS new device once it's connected:
org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/usb_device_582_74_noserial_if0_sound_card_2
and always switches to internal card when there's a DeviceError.

Clearly, the whole mechanism, configuraion and setup will eventually
become too tricky do be done by a bash-script.

ciao,
robin
