yes, http://rg42.org/wiki/jack2contol

However, recent work on tschack and jack2 might be more suitable for
handling suspend/resume, YMMV.

myjackctl.sh does that exactly.
more specific: /etc/pm/sleep.d/90myjackctl.sh does it using myjackctl.sh




Here's a few quotes from an off-list exchange with Sampo:

myjackctl.sh does not map ports. Currently it only restores the
previous physical port-connections, but it's a simple shell script:
change it to fit your needs.

good point. the tool that does the switch will need to remember the last
connection state of _each_ interface. Currently it only remembers _the_
last state - and only very briefly :)

The idea is to go one step further: It should be possible to configure a
set of transition actions for each backend-switch.

That is configurable.The example-commandline I posted only switches to
THIS new device once it's connected:
org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/usb_device_582_74_noserial_if0_sound_card_2
and always switches to internal card when there's a DeviceError.

Clearly, the whole mechanism, configuraion and setup will eventually
become too tricky do be done by a bash-script.
