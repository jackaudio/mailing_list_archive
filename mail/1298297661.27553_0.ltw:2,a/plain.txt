its still in its infancy.
it accepts the same options as jackd.
(but options are obtained via controlapi)

the python directory in the tschack repo is going to go away at some
point, i already created a separate PyJackd package with a setup.py


it will enter a commandline prompt, where you can issue a switch
command:

jack> switch alsa -d hw:0

for example.

tschack doesnt have dbus yet.

hmm... maybe ctypes is not honouring LD_LIBRARY_PATH
you can probably use the full path to the libs in python/jackctl.py
