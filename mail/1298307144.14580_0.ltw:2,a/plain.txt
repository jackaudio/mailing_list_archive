Subject:     [Jack-Devel] controlapi" how about a "backend died" callback ?

hi...

it would be nice, if we could add a callback to the controlapi, so that
the controller might get notified when the backend dies.

we currently have 2 callbacks in the control api. and they are passed to
jackctl_server_create() ... i propose adding functions to set these
callbacks, so that we maintain consistency with the normal jack api.

iE:

void jackctl_server_set_backend_died_callback( jackctl_server_t *s, JackCtlBackendDiedCallback cb );
