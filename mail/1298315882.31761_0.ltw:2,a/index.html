&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been musing for a long time over the idea 'what if Jack ports
&gt; were persistent' ? In other words, if they could exists irrespective
&gt; of the application that uses them is running or not.
&gt; 
&gt; This has some far-reaching consequences of course, but there is 
&gt; subset of this idea that is not as mad as it seems (IMHO).
&gt; 
&gt; ** What if physical ports were persistent ? **
&gt; 
&gt; More in detail:
&gt; 
&gt; * The number of physical ports and their names are configured
&gt;   by the user. Names are chosen according to the function a
&gt;   port has in the user's setup, e.g. stereo-monitor-L or R.
&gt; 
&gt; * When a backend is started, the inputs and outputs it provides
&gt;   are mapped to the existing persistent ports, again as configured
&gt;   by the user for any particular hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; * These configurations are stored of course, no need to repeat
&gt;   this work if nothing changes.

we need to add code to parse/write/change the port mapping.
all drivers need to be changed (its not deep, but the change would be
pretty big. 

pretty similar behaviour can be obtained with a session handler.
if i understand paul correctly, he does not like to have this complexity
in jackd.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This would allow:
&gt; 
&gt; * To switch backends without any app being aware of it.
&gt; 
&gt; * A backend to go away (USB or firewire being unplugged)
&gt;   without fatal consequences. Just replug it or replace 
&gt;   it by another one. No need to restart or rewire anything
&gt;   else.
&gt; 
&gt; * To have sessions that are *really* portable, depending only
&gt;   on the availability of some common set of persistent ports.
&gt;   E.g. Ardour's master and/or auditioner would connect to the
&gt;   right ports no matter what they are.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments / flames invited.
