&gt;&gt; Hello all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've been musing for a long time over the idea 'what if Jack ports
&gt;&gt; were persistent' ? In other words, if they could exists irrespective
&gt;&gt; of the application that uses them is running or not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This has some far-reaching consequences of course, but there is 
&gt;&gt; subset of this idea that is not as mad as it seems (IMHO).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ** What if physical ports were persistent ? **
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; More in detail:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * The number of physical ports and their names are configured
&gt;&gt;   by the user. Names are chosen according to the function a
&gt;&gt;   port has in the user's setup, e.g. stereo-monitor-L or R.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * When a backend is started, the inputs and outputs it provides
&gt;&gt;   are mapped to the existing persistent ports, again as configured
&gt;&gt;   by the user for any particular hardware.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * These configurations are stored of course, no need to repeat
&gt;&gt;   this work if nothing changes.

A very cool and tempting concept.

This is some something i've wanted to have since years.. :-)

&gt; we need to add code to parse/write/change the port mapping.
&gt; all drivers need to be changed (its not deep, but the change would be
&gt; pretty big. 
&gt; 
&gt; pretty similar behaviour can be obtained with a session handler.
&gt; if i understand paul correctly, he does not like to have this complexity
&gt; in jackd.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This would allow:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * To switch backends without any app being aware of it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * A backend to go away (USB or firewire being unplugged)
&gt;&gt;   without fatal consequences. Just replug it or replace 
&gt;&gt;   it by another one. No need to restart or rewire anything
&gt;&gt;   else.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * To have sessions that are *really* portable, depending only
&gt;&gt;   on the availability of some common set of persistent ports.
&gt;&gt;   E.g. Ardour's master and/or auditioner would connect to the
&gt;&gt;   right ports no matter what they are.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Comments / flames invited.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ciao,

Pondering possible implementations: this will open pandora's box (again).

Conceptually it seems somewhat backwards but realistically I'm with
Torben: it's not JACK's job and a session-manager could do the trick
(emulate persistent ports). The downside: session-manager fragmentation.
To avoid that, a common session-manager would need to be included with
all implementations of jackd..


Another implementation would introduce a middle-layer for mapping
physical ports between the engine and the back-ends:
To outline the idea:
	On the jack-client side: physical-ports are always persistent (they're
actually virtual-ports).
	On the server-side: jackd transparently maps these
persistent-(virtual)ports to real physical I/O in the backend. Clients
can neither see nor access the real physical "ports".
	This variant would not require any changes to the backend(s), nor
introduce a new port-type. AFAIK It could even be implemented as a
in-process client without requiring any changes to JACK. However the
complexity of parsing configuration, and mapping ports is still an issue.

prepared for more flames\wenlightenment.
Cheers!
