I don't see much difference between your 'virtual' ports and the
'persistent' ones I proposed.

There is a fundamental difference: the backend is what you wait for
to start a cycle, it's the first to be read and the last to be written.

Freewheeling is an option. The 'default' backend (used when the official
one goes away without notice) should be the dummy one with the same sample
rate and period as the real one it replaces.

I don't see how you could have more than one at any time.

Yes.
