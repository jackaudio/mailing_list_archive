&gt; &gt;&gt;  hi...
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; it would be nice, if we could add a callback to the controlapi, so
&gt; &gt;&gt; that the controller might get notified when the backend dies.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; we currently have 2 callbacks in the control api. and they are
&gt; &gt;&gt; passed to jackctl_server_create() ... i propose adding functions to
&gt; &gt;&gt; set these callbacks, so that we maintain consistency with the normal
&gt; &gt;&gt; jack api.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Would be better yes than the current situation. I think we may
&gt; &gt; probably recode jackctl_server_create beacuse it is only used
&gt; &gt; "internally" right now (jackd, jackdbus)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nedko any comment on that?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  iE:
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; void jackctl_server_set_backend_died_callback( jackctl_server_t *s,
&gt; &gt;&gt; JackCtlBackendDiedCallback cb ); -- torben Hohn
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For example...
&gt; 
&gt; Given the curent design of the control api I think that it will probably
&gt; be more consistent to have this as part of the regular api. OTOH as you,
&gt; Stephane, may remember the original control api proposal that I made was
&gt; such that jackdbus did not require a jack client to be created on the
&gt; server side. I dislike most of the regular JACK API and because of this
&gt; it is hard for me to decide.
&gt; 
&gt; Another question is whether we want to keep backward compatibility in
&gt; the control API. Probably ATM it is not worth to maintain backward
&gt; compatibility because AFAIK all users of the control API are bundled
&gt; where the control api is implemented. (there are three variants in the
&gt; wild)
&gt; 
&gt; IMO the real world application of the "backend died" callback is coupled
&gt; with a "backend switched" callback. Thus I think that it is probably
&gt; wise to extend the API in a such way that it covers the both
&gt; notifications. I dont have a deep knowledge on the backend switch
&gt; implementation, but I tend to think that it can be considered a sequence
&gt; of "old backend died" and "new backend activated". One way to implement
&gt; these notifications would be through a "backend status changed"
&gt; callback.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to also mention a related issue that the current jackdbus
&gt; implementation has. The server start can sometimes be very slow
&gt; (i recall reports of about 5 seconds). All reports so far are from users
&gt; of the firewire audio cards, probably the ffado driver. I think that
&gt; backend switch can also get slow, when the target driver/device is a
&gt; firewire one. the current workaround that is in use is to increase the
&gt; dbus timeout when calling the "server start" dbus method.
&gt; 
&gt; IMO this issue should be fixed by making the slow operations
&gt; asynchronous. I think that it will be better to make part of the the
&gt; control api usable async mode. E.g. "request server start" instead of
&gt; "start server and return when it is operational". This also applies to
&gt; the backend switch.

this requires quite a bit of redesign in the server internals.
i dont think the server thread should/can be blocking until things are
up. the control api could just get a controller thread, which then does
these things.

i actually like that the controlapi is synchronous. this makes it pretty
easy. and almost all oprations only take a tenth of a second, or even
less. that ffado takes 3 seconds to start up, seems pretty weird to me,
and i suspect this is some kind of bug (i dont think that any device can
be so shitty, that its actually a h/w bug.

&gt; 
&gt; start server sequence:
&gt;  0. (implicit) "server stopped" -&gt; "server starting" state change
&gt;  1. request server start, the call does not wait for server to start
&gt;  2. server started notification is sent to the api user
&gt;  3. "born" device state change notification is sent to the api user
&gt; 
&gt; stop server sequence:
&gt;  0. (implicit) "server started" -&gt; "server stopping" state change
&gt;  1. request server stop, the call does not wait for server to stop
&gt;  2. "died" device state change notification is sent to the api user
&gt;  3. server stopped notification is sent to the api user
&gt; 
&gt; device died (e.g. user has unplugged the firewire cable):
&gt;  1. "died" device state change notification is sent to the api user
&gt; 
&gt; device reborn (e.g. user has plugged the firewire cable again):
&gt;  0. the backend is monitoring the status of the device it is configured
&gt;     for. either through poll or through a notification mechansim.
&gt;  1. "born" device state change notification is sent to the api user
&gt; 
&gt; device/backend switch:
&gt;  1. "died" device state change notification is sent to the api user
&gt;  2. "born" device state change notification is sent to the api user
&gt; 
&gt; In the above proposal, device state change notifications assume that
&gt; device identification is part of the notification. Also the "died"
&gt; notification should mention whether the device "death" is expected or
&gt; unexpected. In the latter case, the executable that uses the control api
&gt; may notify the user about the unexpected device disappear.
