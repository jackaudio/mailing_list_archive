&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been musing for a long time over the idea 'what if Jack ports

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This has some far-reaching consequences of course, but there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; subset of this idea that is not as mad as it seems (IMHO).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ** What if physical ports were persistent ? **
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I like the idea!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Still I would like to extend the question: What if there where virtual
&gt; &gt; ports?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; These virtual ports would be configured in a configuration(-file) if
&gt; &gt; present or by the first client providing these. If no config-file was
&gt; &gt; there to make the ports persitent forever, they would stay as long as
&gt; &gt; jack is running, regardless of the backend actually in use.
&gt; I don't see much difference between your 'virtual' ports and the
&gt; 'persistent' ones I proposed.

You seemed to limit your persistent ports to hardware-ports. I like to remove 
the distinction between backends and clients and thus between hardware and 
software ports. And I think that virtual/persitent ports can be benefitial to 
other apps/use-cases as well as for abstracting the actual hardware/backend.

&gt; &gt; I would very much like to remove the distinction between "clients" and
&gt; &gt; "backends". After all a traditional client (be it a separate process or
&gt; &gt; an in- server-client) is just a client that is capable of free-wheeling.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a fundamental difference: the backend is what you wait for
&gt; to start a cycle, it's the first to be read and the last to be written.

Yep, so the backend is a client that is master-clock-capable. Other then that 
its a normal client with ports and a processing-callback. Just give it a 
callback or something appropriate to run as master and otherwise tell it when 
it is not running as master.

&gt; &gt; and backend is just an in-server-client that is not (necessarily)
&gt; &gt; free-wheeling capable but definitely master-clock-capable.
&gt; &gt; Thinking about it, even this is not true, the "null"-backend would be the
&gt; &gt; master-clock for freewheeling. Thus hardware-clients would be not-
&gt; &gt; freewheeling-capable. And as long as all clients are either synced or at
&gt; &gt; least have resampling-capabilites (for unsynced hardware-clients), there
&gt; &gt; is no difference between clients and backends...
&gt; 
&gt; Freewheeling is an option. The 'default' backend (used when the official
&gt; one goes away without notice) should be the dummy one with the same sample
&gt; rate and period as the real one it replaces.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some benefits of this would be:
&gt; &gt;  - Several backends running at the same time (like
&gt; &gt;  alsa-on-the-pci-soundcard,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; alsa-on-usb-soundcard and firewire).
&gt; I don't see how you could have more than one at any time.

Given the premise that the soundcards are either all synced externally or the 
clients/backend accessing them do resampling if needed, I don't see any reason 
to limit jack to "run on one sounddevice only". In fact alsa_in/alsa_out and 
the netjack[12] are already showing the need/use-case for multiple backends 
possibly at the same time.

Given the rise of network audio systems and pluggable audio devices via 
firewire and usb, I don't see any reason why jack shouldn't allow multiple 
backends/hardware-accessing clients at the same time. And the only thing that 
distinguishes as backend from a client is the ability to drive the jack-
processing. And that doesn't justify two different code-paths from my pov.

This idea is invading more deeply into the jack internals then your approach. 
But its not changing anything for existing clients. Its only changing 
something for existing backends. And when these backends become clients with 
an additional feature through a defined interface, these could also be used 
independent of the jack-flavour. So instead of threee implementations for the 
alsa-backend, there would be one. And this one implementation would also 
superseed the alsa_in/alsa_out apps. Sounds good to me...

Have fun,

Arnold
