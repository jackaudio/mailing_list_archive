I agree, but as my original post should have made clear, that
is not what I proposed to discuss even if I like the idea.
Abstracting the HW in this way is something that *could* be
done given a bit of courage. Doing this with application ports
as well is much more ambitious, it would have deep consequences
and would leave little of Jack as we know it.
