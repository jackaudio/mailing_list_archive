&gt; &gt; You seemed to limit your persistent ports to hardware-ports. I like to

&gt; &gt; can be benefitial to other apps/use-cases as well as for abstracting the

&gt; I agree, but as my original post should have made clear, that
&gt; is not what I proposed to discuss even if I like the idea.
&gt; Abstracting the HW in this way is something that *could* be
&gt; done given a bit of courage. Doing this with application ports
&gt; as well is much more ambitious,

I don't think there is much difference between "persistant hardware ports" and 
"persistant ports" when it comes to jack internals.
I fear that if we settle for abstract hardware ports only, we do the same 
discussion in about two or three years of time again...

&gt; it would have deep consequences
&gt; and would leave little of Jack as we know it.

But it certainly isn't the end of the world (as we know it...)

Have fun,

Arnold
