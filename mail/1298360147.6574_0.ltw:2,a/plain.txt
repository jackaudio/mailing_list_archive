I was waiting for that. Yes, it is more then that. It also has resampling to 
care for unmatched samplingrates and not-synchronized devices. (If there is 
even more, please tell me. Not everyone of us has days to spend looking 
through other peoples code.)
Does that mean that my idea/vision is sunk?
Why not make that resampling available to other clients as well? A firewire-
client or an avb-/rtp-client would very much like to reuse the resampling-code 
without duplicating it. And both would also be able to control jacks clock if 
they where the only hardware-client running.

Have fun,

Arnold

PS: Sorry if I keep on insisting on this idea of mine. Unless you give me good 
arguments like "its never going to happen in any jack we release" or "we 
accept your patches but we won't think about implementing it ourselfs" I 
currently see no reason to stop my thoughts.
