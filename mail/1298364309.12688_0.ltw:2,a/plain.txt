The question is: Does jack want to stay confined to a single system? If
not, I'd propose using timestamps on incoming samples and defininition
of a system latency. This not only allows to specify exactly when data
is to be played out (sample synchronicity across all clients, even with
different path lengths), it also would allow jack to keep in touch with
upcoming audio standards.
