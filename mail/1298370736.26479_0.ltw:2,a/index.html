&gt; Paul,

&gt; &gt; So the question is: should anything be done about this? Should ardour
&gt; &gt; force a recompute of the latencies when a track changes modes? This is
&gt; &gt; quite expensive and definitely non-RT in jack1; its doable with
&gt; &gt; tschak. jack2 does not have an implementation of this latency API yet.
&gt; &gt; Could we just redefine the latency specifications into something that
&gt; &gt; is still useful, but avoids this issue? Or something else?
&gt; 
&gt; The question is: Does jack want to stay confined to a single system? If
&gt; not, I'd propose using timestamps on incoming samples and defininition
&gt; of a system latency. This not only allows to specify exactly when data
&gt; is to be played out (sample synchronicity across all clients, even with
&gt; different path lengths), it also would allow jack to keep in touch with
&gt; upcoming audio standards.

as long as jack doesnt do latency compensation, this is not possible.

iff jack does latency compensation, things might look different.
(i am not against this, but its a pretty deep change, and i am not sure
about all implications of this, its a new api, and i dont really know if
we can make legacy jack clients compatible with this (maybe all clients
that dont do latency comp))

when we start dealing with timestamped audio buffers, there is not much
point in still executing the graph in a synchronous way, like we are
doing now. so i basically think, that this is a good candidate for jack3


what is possible with this new latency api is to extend the latency
computation to a whole netjack graph.

but i think this is off topic for this thread.
