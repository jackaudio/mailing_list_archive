as long as jack doesnt do latency compensation, this is not possible.

iff jack does latency compensation, things might look different.
(i am not against this, but its a pretty deep change, and i am not sure
about all implications of this, its a new api, and i dont really know if
we can make legacy jack clients compatible with this (maybe all clients
that dont do latency comp))

when we start dealing with timestamped audio buffers, there is not much
point in still executing the graph in a synchronous way, like we are
doing now. so i basically think, that this is a good candidate for jack3


what is possible with this new latency api is to extend the latency
computation to a whole netjack graph.

but i think this is off topic for this thread.
