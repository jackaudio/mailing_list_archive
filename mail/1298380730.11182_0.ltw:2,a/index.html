&gt; PS: Sorry if I keep on insisting on this idea of mine. Unless you give me good

&gt; currently see no reason to stop my thoughts.

i have no opposition to this idea (and its one that has been floating
around for a while) - I think its a good one. But as i usually tend to
do, i'm trying to explore the reasons why it won't work or why it will
be much more complex than initially meets the eye... in the hopes that
it actually will. its a role i've played in every team/group i've ever
been in.

my point was that if you allow multiple backends inside jackd, then
without the rather pointless limitation that all controlled h/w is
externally synced, you still have to deal with SRC to keep things in
sync, along with all the other details that alsa_{in,out} addresses.
jack2's "adapters" also face this issue, but don't seem to tackle the
details quite as thoroughly AFAICT.
