&gt; &gt; PS: Sorry if I keep on insisting on this idea of mine. Unless you give me good
&gt; &gt; arguments like "its never going to happen in any jack we release" or "we
&gt; &gt; accept your patches but we won't think about implementing it ourselfs" I
&gt; &gt; currently see no reason to stop my thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; i have no opposition to this idea (and its one that has been floating
&gt; around for a while) - I think its a good one. But as i usually tend to
&gt; do, i'm trying to explore the reasons why it won't work or why it will
&gt; be much more complex than initially meets the eye... in the hopes that
&gt; it actually will. its a role i've played in every team/group i've ever
&gt; been in.
&gt; 
&gt; my point was that if you allow multiple backends inside jackd, then
&gt; without the rather pointless limitation that all controlled h/w is
&gt; externally synced, you still have to deal with SRC to keep things in
&gt; sync, along with all the other details that alsa_{in,out} addresses.
&gt; jack2's "adapters" also face this issue, but don't seem to tackle the
&gt; details quite as thoroughly AFAICT.

jack2 already has slave backends. this is pretty much what you are
talking about.
slave backends are pretty easy to do.
