if this was using a facility like jack_port_tie() it wouldnt need a
process_cb, and we would still get zero copy behaviour.

the impact on the code would be quite small.
(only need to fix jack_port_tie() )

the cons of this approach is that the original h/w ports are still
visible, and autoconnect clients like mplayer and portaudio would still
connect to the system ports, and not the new virtual ones.

nedko already has somthing like this in his ladish rooms
(he is using a separate client, which does memcpy in the process_cb, but
the principle is pretty similar)
