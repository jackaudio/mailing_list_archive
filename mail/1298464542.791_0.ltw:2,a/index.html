&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been musing for a long time over the idea 'what if Jack ports
&gt; were persistent' ? In other words, if they could exists irrespective
&gt; of the application that uses them is running or not.
&gt; 
&gt; This has some far-reaching consequences of course, but there is
&gt; subset of this idea that is not as mad as it seems (IMHO).
&gt; 
&gt; ** What if physical ports were persistent ? **

Here is a practical(?) and maybe less intrusive implementation idea to achieve 
this:

What if we dropping names for ports and just give them a unique identifier upon 
creation issued by jack(server), like an uuid. And the the names the users see 
are all aliases. Of course the number of aliases per port should then be 
unlimited or at least in the range of 2^7. And then when registering an alias 
for a port (which might fail if that alias is already defined for another 
port), an extra argument or alias-property defines if the alias is a persitent 
one. Persitant aliases then live on as dumb zero-producing, backhole-consuming 
ports when the registered port doesn't exist anymore and can be reclaimed by 
the next app/client/backend when registering that alias.

Aliases are already in jack, making them (virtually) unlimited and dropping 
the primary name for ports should be rather unintrusive. And allowing many 
aliases for ports should also not affect performance, as the aliases are only 
used in non-rt context for connections and gui, once the connection is 
registered the actual unique-identifier of the port is used in the rt thread 
and if that unique identifier is a simple int or long, its definitely faster for 
access than comparing char* strings...

Have fun,

Arnold
