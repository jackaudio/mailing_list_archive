Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Fwd: A question regarding JACK

Hello,

I'm a student in the Software Engineering faculty. As a part of my final
project, I need to create an application, which will use a third party
engine that receives audio, process it and sends back the final result.

I would like to use JACK and would like to know if I can configure two
computers with JACK, so that each computer serves as a sender and a receiver
at the same time. I want the first computer to send raw audio to the second
computer which will process it and then send the result to the first
computer. When the sound is received in the first computer, it will be sent
to the speakers. Thus, each computer serves as master and slave at the same
time.

Is it possible using JACK? Can you please explain how it should be done?
