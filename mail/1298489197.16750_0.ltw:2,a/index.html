&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a student in the Software Engineering faculty. As a part of my final
&gt; project, I need to create an application, which will use a third party
&gt; engine that receives audio, process it and sends back the final result.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to use JACK and would like to know if I can configure two
&gt; computers with JACK, so that each computer serves as a sender and a receiver
&gt; at the same time. I want the first computer to send raw audio to the second
&gt; computer which will process it and then send the result to the first
&gt; computer. When the sound is received in the first computer, it will be sent
&gt; to the speakers. Thus, each computer serves as master and slave at the same
&gt; time.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible using JACK? Can you please explain how it should be done?

This is exactly what the "net" backend and the jack_netsource client is
for. In JACK-speak the "master" is the computer that is using a
soundcard and the "slave" is the one that just does processing. You run
a jackd with a normal backend (e.g. alsa, oss, freebob or whatever) and
a jack_netsource client on the master computer, and on the slave
computer you run a jackd with the net backend and your processing
client. Read the man pages for jackd and jack_netsource for the details.

If you want to monitor the audio at the slave computer you can also use
alsa_out.
