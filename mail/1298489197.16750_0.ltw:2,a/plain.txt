This is exactly what the "net" backend and the jack_netsource client is
for. In JACK-speak the "master" is the computer that is using a
soundcard and the "slave" is the one that just does processing. You run
a jackd with a normal backend (e.g. alsa, oss, freebob or whatever) and
a jack_netsource client on the master computer, and on the slave
computer you run a jackd with the net backend and your processing
client. Read the man pages for jackd and jack_netsource for the details.

If you want to monitor the audio at the slave computer you can also use
alsa_out.
