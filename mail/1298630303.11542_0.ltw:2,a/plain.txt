Congrats, I am trying the same (with one evening every two weeks to spend on 
this currently).

I started with making normal clients for sending and receiving rtp. Extension 
to the other standards and extension into a backend follows later.

You mean the drop-box in qjackctl? That is not in jack itself, but in jackctl. 
And a very last step once your backend is working. Until then you really 
should learn how to use the commandline and how to start jack from the 
commandline (once you have a backend to test).

Have fun,

Arnold
