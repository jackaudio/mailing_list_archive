Hi,
> And you are aware that you cannot do AVB without proper hardware support?
First i want to build a direct (crossover) connected test system.
Ubuntu Studio rt interconnected with Xilinx Spartan 3AN with AVB IP.
therefore i dont need a avb ready switch at the moment.
since there is the PTPv2 sw implementation 
(http://www.bartky.net/products.htm), the endpoint requirements of avb 
are met by most computer hardware, but requires extensive network kernel 
module modification.

Yeah, thats the way i want to do it too. but because of the preperation 
and scheduling for this project, first i want to make the backend, then 
rtp implementation and then kernel module modification.

thank you!
