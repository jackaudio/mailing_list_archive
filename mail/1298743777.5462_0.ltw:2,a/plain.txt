I have to admit that I haven't looked at the avb-standard-definition yet.
But so far I was under the impression that avb is aimed at home-entertainment 
and the likes and thus neither needs special switches nor special nics. 
Ravenna on the other hand...

I would propose to start with rtp-streaming compatible to what avb defines, 
keeping the need for hardware-timestamping in mind and just use the available 
clocks for timestamping for now. So that we get a working implementation which 
can be extended to full avb standard and later on to the full ravenna 
standard.
Altough ravenna is aimed at the broadcasting world, the fact that I am not the 
only one dreaming about jack doing avb and the likes shows me that if it 
works, its also a viable solution for the semi-professional and live-
professional usage...

Anyway, I think we should start this. Maybe with a public repository 
somewhere. (I would love to participate in this.) 

Have fun,

Arnold
