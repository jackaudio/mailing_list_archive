I believe you guys see it with from the wrong perspective. I don't see
AVB support in jack as a backend, but as a simple bridge from AVB ports
to jack ports.  This can be achieved by simple stand-alone tools, much
like netjack.

If you want to provide physical inputs or outputs for Ravenna on your
machine, there's nothing you can do without special hardware - for the
moment. You have to produce a phase synchronous clock, synced via PtP,
and provide a means to timestamp incoming samples and output samples at
the correct point in time.
