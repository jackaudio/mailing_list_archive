yes. please make your own git repo. i am currently having problems with
my server. pushing and merging git repos around is trivial.

however. i will not support merging commits like "it works" 
commits should have adequate messages of what they do.
and having the whole history of failures around in the jack1 svn is not
really optimal.

but i will merge stuff quickly into tschack.
