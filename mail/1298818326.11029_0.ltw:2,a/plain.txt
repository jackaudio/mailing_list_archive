netjack also has a backend.
if you want to slave jack to some external clock, you need to write a
backend. 

so for the case where you want to slave jack to some avb devices,
you need to write a backend.
this use-case is particularly interesting, because it will work with
normal hardware. (it probably doesnt even need a software ptp
implementation)

this doesnt seem to be true.
sure... if you want different output device clocks to be correlated,
then you need an accurate ptp clock.

but to just output a stream.... no special hardware is needed.
clock extraction out of streams becomes harder with higher jitter.
so with an exact ptp clock, things are dead easy.

netjack1 is pretty good with extracting a clock from a WAN stream.
