You mean in the case where jack would only operate on AVB streams and
not use any local sound interface?

I was thinking of the case where jack operates on a local backend and
does SRC on AVB ports, if neccessary.

It is not I who wants it, it is the spec that demand a phase synchronous
clock that matches AES criteria, and bit transparency, amongst other things.

If you just produce sound (and do not care about synchronization with
other sound sources) or want to store the data, yes. In any other case
you need a means of hardware synchronization.

Just a bit of housekeeping.
