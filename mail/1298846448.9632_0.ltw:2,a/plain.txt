Subject:     [Jack-Devel] testing netjack has broken my linux setup (headless system)

Hello,

I just have a quick question about netjack (in jack2).

yesterday, i tested out netjack with my headless system setup as a
slave and my desktop setup as the master.
i just wanted to see how well netjack worked. anyways, i didn't delve
all that deep, as i knew i have a gig tomorrow night, that requires
my headless system to be working, as it usually does without issues.

So, i switched back to the ALSA backend, but now a key application
(that i require) no longer works, at all. the app is Sooperlooper.
all of a sudden it cannot connect to jack and/or cannot resolve
hostname.  However, after further inspection, all of my settings are
correct both in sooperlooper,
and /etc/hosts (from which sooperlooper references to resolve the
hostname). All of my networking is working fine, i have tried every
method i can think of to fix the issue ~ from manually via commandline
specifying the hostname on sooperlloper startup to deleting
sooperlooper, experimenting  line by line changing my /etc/hosts to
all-together deleting sooperlooper (and all of it's configurations)
and re-installing/re-compiling it...  My only conclusion is that
netjack has screwed everything up. (also, my hostname resolves just
fine using "ping:).

I will also add everything else is working fine (Jack itsellf, VSTs,
Jack-rack, and all routing presets)

So, my question is this:

** what system files could using the netjack backend have altered that
now won't allow sooperlooper to run anymore?
does netjack indeed change around any files on the system???? **

I do NOT update this machine, nor did I change any other setting aside
from switching backends. I'm a bit flustered, as like i said i have a
gig tomorrow, and i have spent the majority of the day already, trying
to fix this problem (which may seem minor, but is actually a HUGE
issue for me! and very frustrating) Nor, do i have time to re-install
(and realistically, i shouldn't have to). In my eyes switching
backends should not result in a broken system ~ which clearly it has.
:(

if anyone has any insights into what could have possibly gone wrong, i
am all ears!

...and i suppose that will be the 1st time and very last time, i will
ever use netjack, which is too bad because the concept
seemed like it could have been useful , as i have several machines
running linux/Jack.

thanks,

jordan
