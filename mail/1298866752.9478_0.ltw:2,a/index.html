Seems like interest and events are coming together all around.
Using standard networking hardware to connect audio devices has been
something
I have wanted for quite a while, but most solutions were proprietary and
because
of that didn't play well in the Linux ecosystem.  NetJack was a notable
exception, but I just couldn't convince myself that running a jack server
on my
ADC was the right way to do it.

Sorry for the length of this, I'm just catching up on several digests.

&gt; There is a new network standard comming up specialized for audio and
&gt; video transmission, called AVB (Audio Video Bridging -&gt; IEEE 802.1AS,
&gt; 802.1Qat, 802.1Qav,...).

I have been looking into that over the past couple of weeks, and it seems
that
AVB handles network infrastructure requirements, but does not specify higher
layer protocol.  So the AVB specification handles clock synchronization,
stream
bandwidth reservation, and VLAN setup, and as far as I can tell so far,
that is
all.  You still have to have session control to discover end points, discover
how many channels are offered by the end point, set up connections, define
the
arrangement of audio samples within the packets, etc.

The proprietary methods cover all those other aspects.  The ones which
seem to
lend themselves most readily to software implementation (i.e. should not
require
custom hardware on the computer end) seem to be Dante from Audinate and
Livewire from Axia.  Both are proprietary and not publicly documented.
Ravenna seems that it will become the best choice given the statements
that it
will be published as an open (and I think freely available) standard, but it
does not seem to be finished yet.  The Ravenna web site contains no
documentation so far.

&gt; I want do integrate this standard into jack2.
&gt; I want to choose AVB (not ALSA or NET) from the driver dropdown box.

Is there a particular reason you want to make it native in JACK and not
incorporate it into the ALSA drivers?  I have been considering the same
question, whether it is better to have a driver native in JACK, or whether it
would be better to have it independent of JACK so that it could hopefully
attract developers from the non-JACK audio world as well.  Having an
interface
compatible with ALSA would be attractive from that standpoint, because any
other
Linux application should be able to use it, and JACK should still be able
to use
it through the ALSA backend.

Florian Faber wrote:
&gt; And you are aware that you cannot do AVB without proper hardware support?

Do you mean because of the IEEE-1588 based clock synchronization?
There are software implementations of 1588, are they not accurate enough to
meet AVB requirements?

Arnold Krille wrote:
&gt; I started with making normal clients for sending and receiving rtp.

Have you only sent data, or also handled querying for number of channels
offered, other things required to get general clients connected?  Or just
simple test applications which always have fixed channels?

&gt; since there is the PTPv2 sw implementation

Have you looked at the PTP implementation with BSD style license?
http://ptpd.sourceforge.net/

Adrian Knoth wrote:
&gt; To my knowledge, there are only thee NICs available which make sense to

You can use a software time stamping implementation, but with less accuracy
and much higher jitter.   So depending on the requirements you may need a
specialized NIC or you may not.  There will be more available soon, I think
Broadcom and Marvell are working on some.

Arnold Krille wrote:
&gt; I have to admit that I haven't looked at the avb-standard-definition yet.
&gt; But so far I was under the impression that avb is aimed at
&gt; home-entertainment and the likes

It started out aimed at home entertainment, but expanded to also include
professional audio and automotive networking.

&gt; and thus neither needs special switches
&gt; nor special nics.

You need switches which understand VLAN tagging and bandwidth reservation
for quality-of-service.  I don't think the synchronization adds any
requirements
to the switches, just the endpoints, but I'm not positive on that yet.

&gt; Ravenna on the other hand...

Ravenna is just using AVB, as far as I can see from the limited documentation
that Ravenna has released so far, Ravenna has no requirements beyond AVB.


Florian Faber wrote:
&gt; If you want to provide physical inputs or outputs for Ravenna on your

Has any documentation on the Ravenna protocol been released publicly yet?

&gt; You have to produce a phase synchronous clock, synced via PtP,
&gt; and provide a means to timestamp incoming samples and output samples at
&gt; the correct point in time.

What is the requirement for time stamping incoming samples?

This is the view point from which I ask the question:  I see the
interesting use
of networked audio as an inexpensive way to get multiple channels of remote
audio into or out of a standard PC without a rather expensive card capable of
MADI or multiple AES3 channels, and in that case the master clock should
be in
the ADC or DAC, so the PC only has to send the incoming packets to hard
drive,
or send outgoing packets at close enough to the correct time that the DAC
buffer
does not have an over or under run.

Does that use case still require hardware timestamp capability on the PC, or
would a software implementation of 1588/802AS meet the requirements?

Arnold Krille &lt;[hidden]
&gt; I don't want to be fixed exclusively on the network-peers, I want to use
&gt; my internal sounddevices to play that sound too.

That should definitely be a separate use case.  Use of independent clock
domains
is always a pain, and requires SRC to reconcile all the audio to a single
clock
domain at some point.  Single clock domain should definitely be handled
first,
and then separate domains can be added as a special case later.

What might be useful is a way to force JACK to use multiple output devices if
you know that they are all on the same clock domain, e.g. you have two
different
devices which are synchronized with word clock or AES11.  I don't think JACK
currently allows to use two different devices as output, does it?  You
have to
use some ALSA trickery to make a composite device?

&gt; so for the case where you want to slave jack to some avb devices,
&gt; you need to write a backend.
&gt; this use-case is particularly interesting, because it will work with
&gt; normal hardware. (it probably doesnt even need a software ptp
&gt; implementation)

Torben, can you elaborate on that a bit?  We've gone from Florian saying that
we need PTP capable hardware, to you saying that we don't even need software
PTP.
For that to be the case, would you not need some type of feedback signal from
an output sink (e.g. DAC) to let you know when the output buffers were too
low
or too full? Some network equivalent of the interrupt you get from a PCI
card,
and the values in the status register that let you know that it needs more
buffers to DMA.

&gt; but to just output a stream.... no special hardware is needed.

How to you make sure that the DAC buffers do not underrun, or that you do
not send too much data too closely together and cause overrun?  I'll
ignore ADC
for the moment, that seems the easy case as long as your PC is fast
enough to keep up with the amount of data that the ADC is sending.

Florian Faber wrote:
&gt; You mean in the case where jack would only operate on AVB streams and
&gt; not use any local sound interface?

That is the case I find interesting.  A network attached ADC/DAC, either a
single device, or possible separate devices which may have an external clock
synchronization, or which both have hardware PTP capability and synchronize
their internal clocks that way.  Then a standard PC or server (which all have
Gb capable network interfaces, often more than one) can be connected to that
device for audio I/O without requiring to spend an additional $1500 on a MADI
card.  Something just seems odd about spending $1000 on the computer and
$1500
on the audio interface card.  I don't mind spending money on good ADC and
DAC,
but it doesn't seem right to spend so much money for (relatively) low bit
rate
data transfer between the PC and the data source/sink.

&gt; I was thinking of the case where jack operates on a local backend and
&gt; does SRC on AVB ports, if neccessary.

That seems to unnecessarily complicate the problem before the first steps are
even taken.

&gt; It is not I who wants it, it is the spec that demand a phase synchronous
&gt; clock that matches AES criteria, and bit transparency, amongst other
&gt; things.

Is the spec available yet?  I only discovered Ravenna very recently, and
currently on the web site it says that "RAVENNA will be an open technology
standard without a proprietary licensing policy."  Future tense "will be,"
not
current tense "is" an open standard.

&gt;&gt; but to just output a stream.... no special hardware is needed.
&gt;
&gt; If you just produce sound (and do not care about synchronization with
&gt; other sound sources) or want to store the data, yes.

So take the case which is probably pretty common on this list: Ardour running
on a PC with JACK, connected to one device which has some number of ADC and
DAC used to record and play audio.  What would be needed in that case?  PTP
hardware?  PTP software?  Neither?

&gt; In any other case you need a means of hardware synchronization.

Could you describe the cases which would definitely require hardware synch?
Are those cases effectively the equivalent of having multiple sound cards in
one computer, which require an external clock to synchronize the audio clocks
on the cards?  E.g. outputting to two separate network DAC would require
synchronization.  Would the PC definitely require hardware
synchronization, or
would it suffice to have the two audio devices synchronized?
