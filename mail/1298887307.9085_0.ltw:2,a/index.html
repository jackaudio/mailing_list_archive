Chris,

first maybe we should differentiate between AVB and Ravenna. AVB is
targeting consumers and has pretty relaxed requirements. Ravenna is
targeting the broadcast sector; it uses some of the basic techniques
from AVB, but adds proper clocks, device discovery etc. Think of
connecting a mic to a speaker and all the problems involved. Or changing
the one defective microphone in a setup with 80 mics. Without the "one
cable, one signal" paradigm things tend to become ridiculously complicated.

I personally have no interest in AVB.

&gt; Seems like interest and events are coming together all around.

The topic comes up from time to time. It will become more interesting
with the availability of cheap AVB compliant network hardware. So far it
is quite expensive, as you probably know - after all, PtP was invented
at HP. For the price of just one switch with PtP support you can already
buy a MADI interface.

&gt; I have been looking into that over the past couple of weeks, and it seems that
&gt; AVB handles network infrastructure requirements, but does not specify higher
&gt; layer protocol.  So the AVB specification handles clock synchronization,
&gt; stream bandwidth reservation, and VLAN setup, and as far as I can tell so far,
&gt; that is all. 

What should be more to it? It creates an environment where you have a
synchronous media clock and a means to transport data. That's all you
need to reliably transport any realtime data that might come. Think of
AVB as a protocol suite, not a protocol itself.

&gt; You still have to have session control to discover end points, discover
&gt; how many channels are offered by the end point, set up connections, define
&gt; the arrangement of audio samples within the packets, etc.

All this is handled by other already existing protocols.

&gt; Ravenna seems that it will become the best choice given the statements
&gt; that it will be published as an open (and I think freely available) standard, 
&gt; but it does not seem to be finished yet.  The Ravenna web site contains no
&gt; documentation so far.

There are early-adopter partners to provide a full signal chain from
microphone to speaker, including infrastructure and DAW. You can already
buy Ravenna equipment if you want to start and play with it.

The protocol specs will be released to the public, don't worry. It was
just presented on last year's IBC, give the guys a little time.

&gt; Is there a particular reason you want to make it native in JACK and not
&gt; incorporate it into the ALSA drivers?  I have been considering the same
&gt; question, whether it is better to have a driver native in JACK, or whether it
&gt; would be better to have it independent of JACK so that it could hopefully
&gt; attract developers from the non-JACK audio world as well.  Having an
&gt; interface
&gt; compatible with ALSA would be attractive from that standpoint, because any
&gt; other
&gt; Linux application should be able to use it, and JACK should still be able
&gt; to use it through the ALSA backend.

Sound cards don't tend to change their number of channels all the time,
as do network devices. ALSA is not very good at coping with variable
channel numbers, as any RME user knows. Limiting it to the "I just want
to connect one device!!1" case is not useful.

&gt;&gt; And you are aware that you cannot do AVB without proper hardware support?
&gt; Do you mean because of the IEEE-1588 based clock synchronization?

Yes.

&gt; There are software implementations of 1588, are they not accurate enough to
&gt; meet AVB requirements?

It depends what you want to achieve. If you just want to push out data
and be done, you're ready to go.

&gt; You need switches which understand VLAN tagging and bandwidth reservation
&gt; for quality-of-service.  I don't think the synchronization adds any
&gt; requirements
&gt; to the switches, just the endpoints, but I'm not positive on that yet.

The switches have to support PtP as well, they have to compensate their
processing and transport latencies as well.

&gt;&gt; Ravenna on the other hand...
&gt; Ravenna is just using AVB, as far as I can see from the limited documentation
&gt; that Ravenna has released so far, Ravenna has no requirements beyond AVB.

Ravenna is 'just' another protocol suite that supersets AVB, and has
much stricter requirements, e.g. the phase synchronous media clock and
the timestamping. If you somehow manage to implement this in software on
a general purpose computer, well..

&gt; What is the requirement for time stamping incoming samples?

Very brief: You have to accurately timestamp the moment t_s those
samples are taken (think of an AES word clock). In a Ravenna clock
domain, you specify a system latency t_l, so that you have this time
frame to process and transport your data. Any samples are then output at
t_s+t_l exactly.

&gt; Does that use case still require hardware timestamp capability on the PC, or
&gt; would a software implementation of 1588/802AS meet the requirements?

If you just want to throw data to one device (or receive the data), you
can do it in software alone, sure. In that case all the timestamping
etc. is done in the hardware. Use the PtP clock to derive your media
clock and manage the buffers. For AVB, it is even simpler, as there are
already means for flow control.

&gt; Single clock domain should definitely be handled
&gt; first, and then separate domains can be added as a special case later.

Ravenna requires bit transparency. IOT: No SRC :)

&gt; What might be useful is a way to force JACK to use multiple output devices if
&gt; you know that they are all on the same clock domain, e.g. you have two
&gt; different
&gt; devices which are synchronized with word clock or AES11.  I don't think JACK
&gt; currently allows to use two different devices as output, does it?  You
&gt; have to use some ALSA trickery to make a composite device?

You don't have to. All you need is a simple jack client that speaks RTP
and that transparently bridges Ravenna ports to jack ports and vice
versa: Connect a console and magically all the ports pop up in ardour.

&gt; Torben, can you elaborate on that a bit?  We've gone from Florian saying that
&gt; we need PTP capable hardware, to you saying that we don't even need software
&gt; PTP.

You mix up AVB and Ravenna, and cases where you just input/output data
to/from one device, have a sound interface in your computer or talk to
multiple devices. Make up your mind :)

&gt;&gt; I was thinking of the case where jack operates on a local backend and
&gt;&gt; does SRC on AVB ports, if neccessary.
&gt; That seems to unnecessarily complicate the problem before the first steps are
&gt; even taken.

This would basically be a modified netjack client.

&gt;&gt; If you just produce sound (and do not care about synchronization with
&gt;&gt; other sound sources) or want to store the data, yes.
&gt; So take the case which is probably pretty common on this list: Ardour running
&gt; on a PC with JACK, connected to one device which has some number of ADC and
&gt; DAC used to record and play audio.  What would be needed in that case?  PTP
&gt; hardware?  PTP software?  Neither?

If all input and output is performed on the external device and it has
its own grand master clock, you can do it in software. But this is,
contrary to your premise, a special use case (in the Ravenna context).

You don't need dedicated ADCs/DACs in the long term, just connect the
mic to the network. Same for speakers, consoles, ... In the mean time,
bridges from/to MADI, ADAT, AES will make the migration step easier.

&gt; Are those cases effectively the equivalent of having multiple sound cards in
&gt; one computer, which require an external clock to synchronize the audio clocks
&gt; on the cards?  E.g. outputting to two separate network DAC would require
&gt; synchronization. Would the PC definitely require hardware
&gt; synchronization, or would it suffice to have the two audio devices synchronized?

Any client that generates audio has to timestamp it, and any client that
outputs audio has to do it at the t_s+t_l point in time. The
timestamping has to by synchronous to the grand master clock within the
AES11 specs.

How you do it, is up to you.

And when you did it, let me break it with a VariSpeed setup :)
