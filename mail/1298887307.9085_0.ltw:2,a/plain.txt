Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Writing an IEEE 802.1BA (AVB) compliant network backend for Jack2

Chris,

first maybe we should differentiate between AVB and Ravenna. AVB is
targeting consumers and has pretty relaxed requirements. Ravenna is
targeting the broadcast sector; it uses some of the basic techniques
from AVB, but adds proper clocks, device discovery etc. Think of
connecting a mic to a speaker and all the problems involved. Or changing
the one defective microphone in a setup with 80 mics. Without the "one
cable, one signal" paradigm things tend to become ridiculously complicated.

I personally have no interest in AVB.

> Seems like interest and events are coming together all around.

The topic comes up from time to time. It will become more interesting
with the availability of cheap AVB compliant network hardware. So far it
is quite expensive, as you probably know - after all, PtP was invented
at HP. For the price of just one switch with PtP support you can already
buy a MADI interface.

What should be more to it? It creates an environment where you have a
synchronous media clock and a means to transport data. That's all you
need to reliably transport any realtime data that might come. Think of
AVB as a protocol suite, not a protocol itself.

All this is handled by other already existing protocols.

There are early-adopter partners to provide a full signal chain from
microphone to speaker, including infrastructure and DAW. You can already
buy Ravenna equipment if you want to start and play with it.

The protocol specs will be released to the public, don't worry. It was
just presented on last year's IBC, give the guys a little time.

Sound cards don't tend to change their number of channels all the time,
as do network devices. ALSA is not very good at coping with variable
channel numbers, as any RME user knows. Limiting it to the "I just want
to connect one device!!1" case is not useful.

Yes.

It depends what you want to achieve. If you just want to push out data
and be done, you're ready to go.

The switches have to support PtP as well, they have to compensate their
processing and transport latencies as well.

Ravenna is 'just' another protocol suite that supersets AVB, and has
much stricter requirements, e.g. the phase synchronous media clock and
the timestamping. If you somehow manage to implement this in software on
a general purpose computer, well..

> What is the requirement for time stamping incoming samples?

Very brief: You have to accurately timestamp the moment t_s those
samples are taken (think of an AES word clock). In a Ravenna clock
domain, you specify a system latency t_l, so that you have this time
frame to process and transport your data. Any samples are then output at
t_s+t_l exactly.

If you just want to throw data to one device (or receive the data), you
can do it in software alone, sure. In that case all the timestamping
etc. is done in the hardware. Use the PtP clock to derive your media
clock and manage the buffers. For AVB, it is even simpler, as there are
already means for flow control.

Ravenna requires bit transparency. IOT: No SRC :)

You don't have to. All you need is a simple jack client that speaks RTP
and that transparently bridges Ravenna ports to jack ports and vice
versa: Connect a console and magically all the ports pop up in ardour.

You mix up AVB and Ravenna, and cases where you just input/output data
to/from one device, have a sound interface in your computer or talk to
multiple devices. Make up your mind :)

This would basically be a modified netjack client.

If all input and output is performed on the external device and it has
its own grand master clock, you can do it in software. But this is,
contrary to your premise, a special use case (in the Ravenna context).

You don't need dedicated ADCs/DACs in the long term, just connect the
mic to the network. Same for speakers, consoles, ... In the mean time,
bridges from/to MADI, ADAT, AES will make the migration step easier.

Any client that generates audio has to timestamp it, and any client that
outputs audio has to do it at the t_s+t_l point in time. The
timestamping has to by synchronous to the grand master clock within the
AES11 specs.

How you do it, is up to you.

And when you did it, let me break it with a VariSpeed setup :)
