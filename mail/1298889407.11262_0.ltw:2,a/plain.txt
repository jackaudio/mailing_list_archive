Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jconvolver and OSX

Hi

I've been trying to install jconvolver under OSX (10.5 / 10.6).  Does  
anyone know if this is at all possible, and if so, any hints?

I've searched the Internet quite thoroughly, tried a few roundabout  
ways (Flink for example), yet the first obstacle appears to be libzita- 
convolver (2.0.0). (libclthreads appears to be installed OK). I'm  
running JackPilot v 1.6.5.

Thanks for any tips!

Natasha
