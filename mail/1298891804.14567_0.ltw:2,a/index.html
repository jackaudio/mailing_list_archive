&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I just have a quick question about netjack (in jack2).
&gt; 
&gt; yesterday, i tested out netjack with my headless system setup as a
&gt; slave and my desktop setup as the master.
&gt; i just wanted to see how well netjack worked. anyways, i didn't delve
&gt; all that deep, as i knew i have a gig tomorrow night, that requires
&gt; my headless system to be working, as it usually does without issues.
&gt; 
&gt; So, i switched back to the ALSA backend, but now a key application
&gt; (that i require) no longer works, at all. the app is Sooperlooper.
&gt; all of a sudden it cannot connect to jack and/or cannot resolve
&gt; hostname.  However, after further inspection, all of my settings are
&gt; correct both in sooperlooper,
&gt; and /etc/hosts (from which sooperlooper references to resolve the
&gt; hostname). All of my networking is working fine, i have tried every
&gt; method i can think of to fix the issue ~ from manually via commandline
&gt; specifying the hostname on sooperlloper startup to deleting
&gt; sooperlooper, experimenting  line by line changing my /etc/hosts to
&gt; all-together deleting sooperlooper (and all of it's configurations)
&gt; and re-installing/re-compiling it...  My only conclusion is that
&gt; netjack has screwed everything up. (also, my hostname resolves just
&gt; fine using "ping:).
&gt; 
&gt; I will also add everything else is working fine (Jack itsellf, VSTs,
&gt; Jack-rack, and all routing presets)
&gt; 
&gt; So, my question is this:
&gt; 
&gt; ** what system files could using the netjack backend have altered that
&gt; now won't allow sooperlooper to run anymore?
&gt; does netjack indeed change around any files on the system???? **

no it doesnt change anything.
and as long as you dont run it as root, this isnt even possible.

what may happen is that its blocking usage of its udp port for some
time. but i checked that. netjack2 is correctly using the REUSEADDRESS
flag. that should be fine.


&gt; 
&gt; I do NOT update this machine, nor did I change any other setting aside
&gt; from switching backends. I'm a bit flustered, as like i said i have a
&gt; gig tomorrow, and i have spent the majority of the day already, trying
&gt; to fix this problem (which may seem minor, but is actually a HUGE
&gt; issue for me! and very frustrating) Nor, do i have time to re-install
&gt; (and realistically, i shouldn't have to). In my eyes switching
&gt; backends should not result in a broken system ~ which clearly it has.
&gt; :(
&gt; 
&gt; if anyone has any insights into what could have possibly gone wrong, i
&gt; am all ears!
&gt; 
&gt; ...and i suppose that will be the 1st time and very last time, i will
&gt; ever use netjack, which is too bad because the concept
&gt; seemed like it could have been useful , as i have several machines
&gt; running linux/Jack.

this is sad.
the only reason i see which breaks liblo is a broken /etc/hosts
maybe you should paste it onto the mail ?


&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
