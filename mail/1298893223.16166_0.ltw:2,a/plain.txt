as the code pasted by torben demonstrates, its just a matter of
unlinking the semaphore before proceeding to use it. one could quibble
about the "race condition" that exists for a few microseconds during
which the semaphore *is* publically visible, but really its no
different then the historical technique to create process-private
temporary files.

the *real* issue on OS X is that apple implemented sem_init() with a
stub function. it does not return an error, but does nothing at all.
absolutely appalling decision on their part.
