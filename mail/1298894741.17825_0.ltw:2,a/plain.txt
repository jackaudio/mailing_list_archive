i haven't tried that. from the semantics of unlink(2), i'd suspect
that it would work (since it works that way for files).

that's why the constructor in the code torben pasted has two different
pathways, one for OS X (involving sem_open() and then sem_unlink())
and one for non-OS X involving sem_init(). there are no other changes
required for handling the semaphores (though the sem_close() during
descruction in the OS X case is a good idea for most use cases).

we use these semaphores in ardour3 for multi-threaded graph
synchronization. to be fair, however, we have not really tested them
much on OS X at this point (though we have verified that they work as
expected).
