&gt; &gt; Does that mean that if you create a number of them sequentially
&gt; &gt; and unlink each of them before creating a new one, you can use
&gt; &gt; the same name for all ?
&gt; 
&gt; i haven't tried that. from the semantics of unlink(2), i'd suspect
&gt; that it would work (since it works that way for files).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; the *real* issue on OS X is that apple implemented sem_init() with a
&gt; &gt;&gt; stub function. it does not return an error, but does nothing at all.
&gt; &gt;&gt; absolutely appalling decision on their part.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It doesn't even reset the value ? Zita-convolver relies on that...
&gt; 
&gt; that's why the constructor in the code torben pasted has two different
&gt; pathways, one for OS X (involving sem_open() and then sem_unlink())
&gt; and one for non-OS X involving sem_init(). there are no other changes
&gt; required for handling the semaphores (though the sem_close() during
&gt; descruction in the OS X case is a good idea for most use cases).

But if sem_init() does nothing you can't reset an existing one.
Except by reading the value and then in a loop calling sem_post()
or sem_wait()... Yuk.
 
&gt; we use these semaphores in ardour3 for multi-threaded graph
&gt; synchronization. to be fair, however, we have not really tested them
&gt; much on OS X at this point (though we have verified that they work as
&gt; expected).

How does A3 distribute processing task over multiple threads ?
