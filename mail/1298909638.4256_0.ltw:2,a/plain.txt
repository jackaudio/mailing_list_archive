strange.

before reading fons previous message about anonymous semaphores, I  
tried (2 or 3 months back) building zita-convolver and jconvolve on  
OSX. only posix_memalign was an issue at build time. replacing it by a  
stub, I ended up with a zita-convolver eating all CPU available when  
used. don't remember if it was on OSX 10.5 or 10.6, but using jackOSX  
for sure.

florian schmidt's libconvolve / jack_convolve does works fine on OSX,  
although having constant size partition size, unlike fons one.

I may take a look at those semaphores if I have time and motivation.
