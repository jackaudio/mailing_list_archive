hi Torben,

i'm not silly enough to be running jackd as root ;)  okay, that's good
to know that it shouldn't change anything.
I'm still wondering what happened though? (i guess i'll never know, oh
well... as long as it was a fluke?)

thanks for investigating, the information and your reply... it's very
much appreciated :)

>this is sad.
>the only reason i see which breaks liblo is a broken /etc/hosts

I agree with you here, but i know it wasn't broken by /etc/hosts...
how do i know, you may ask???? (aside from looking at the "last
modified date on /etc/hosts) I have one simple rule when editing
system files ~ always, always, ALWAYS! - keep a record, in the form of
copies!

On any linux machine I have, i have a folder in my home directory
called "myconfig".   This folder contains any and all system files
that i modify (and the originals), along with the odd text file to
remind me of other changes. they are all indexed, so this way I can
always compare,  and always keep proper working versions of any
configuration file that i require...

>maybe you should paste it onto the mail ?

It's a little too late for that. ~ as i have found a work around,
through sheer luck (in part);

Last night i went through a pile of DVDs and found an albeit -
"slightly old backup/clone" of my old fedora 13 setup. (clonezilla,
yes!)
So, i've wiped away the screwed up install, and setup my backup (as it
was from the same machine). it did require some modification, but
nothing too time consuming. ~ all i had to do was move/install all of
the correct sample libraries, presets, recompile 2 applications...and
re-write some scripts to get it working (good enough for now!).

so far it seems to be working, as expected. :) I had forgotten to
clone my (newer) setup, which is REALLY dumb on my part.

*** As far NetJack - i was upset/frustrated yesterday, when i wrote to
the list. MY SINCERE APOLOGIES TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST!!!    I do plan
to use Netjack, just not on production machines (yet). In fact, it is
actually running on 3 machines. And i must say, NetJack has great
potential. ****

as a side-note;  (and why i am interested in NetJack)

I am starting a Project that is all about recycling technology.
semi-broken laptops (smashed LCDs/failed GPUs/broken keyboards/etc)
that could be recycled into musical instruments, and various kinds of
interfaces (ie: old midi-keybaords with dead keys, being recycled into
say, a midi-pedalboard, etc) . my hope is to combat "cyclic
consumption" where perfectly good technology, ends up in a land-fill
for no good reason (in my eyes) ~ when in fact, with a bit of
creativity, they could be used for another purpose....

Maybe an old-laptop isn't powerful enough to run a whole studio....
but how much do you want to bet they'll make a great "looper", or
synthesizer??? **  (then, you can repackage then into a rack-mount or
some other ideal form-factor)

you also have access to re-invent the usage of the HID, ethernet,
wireless, USB and firewire interfaces... :)

So, one potential use for Netjack (for me), would be the idea that i
could "team" these devices, effectively. Using then in parallel or to
off-load processing, etc.

I believe this is a really truly awesome idea, and as it develops, i
plan to document and share my experiences (via video and the
internet)... hopefully, other people will also see it's potential and
viability. I currently have 1 device working perfectly, and 2 others
being developed. One of which has a failed GPU and is using a virtual
frame-buffer in order to run Xserver, and thus X applications - so far
so good!

Obviously, the underlying technology is Linux and more specifically
Jack (and hopefully netjack)~ which is why i mention it.

anyways, thanks Torben.

(i'm just happy i can play the show tonight!)
