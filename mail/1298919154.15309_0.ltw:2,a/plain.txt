Because the internal state of the convolver is as long as
the longest IR that was configured, and therefore it has
has start/stop/reset functions. This allows you to process
a number of buffers without having to flush the complete
state first (useful in non-RT mode). There is also cleanup(),
which returns the object to its pristine state as after
calling the constructor.

Both reset() and cleanup() reset the semaphores.

Now if you stopped cleanly, which means waiting until all
threads have finished (there's a function to test for this),
the semas will be at zero count anyway, so things should work
even without sem_init(). It's there to be sure.
