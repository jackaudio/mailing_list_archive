I think those guys were already split to Agilent at that point.

I was reading the Q-Lan white paper from QSC recently, and they seem to be
using switches with tagged priority support to make the clock packets
traverse the switch as quickly as possible, without relying on switches
which have specific 1588 "transparent clock" ability.  They require 1Gb/s
switches for Q-Lan, which may help with latency.  If you have
quality-of-service support in the switch, couldn't you just have the clock
packets tagged with priority 7, and then use end to end latency
measurement rather than peer to peer?

Perhaps that would work for some protocols, but not meet the tight
requirements of Ravenna.  I'll have to look to see if anyone has made
accuracy and jitter measurements of systems without transparent clock
support in the switch.

I was speaking in the context of the original message, which proposed
creating an AVB back end for Jack2.  Is it accurate to call that an AVB
backend, or would you also have to specify which higher layer protocols
are implemented?  It seems that you could have a backend for Dante, for
Q-Lan, for Lightwire, for Ravenna, and all those would be AVB compatible. 
That was all I meant, that the original question posed was not really
complete without also specifying some additional requirements in addition
to AVB compliant.

OK, I can see that as a good argument for making native network device to
JACK port bridges.

Is the task (of writing a new network interface bridge for JACK) of a size
that only a few people working on it will be able to keep it maintained? 
Netjack is one thing, it only has to work with other jack instances, but
one or two people could not keep up with the number of drivers in ALSA.  I
hope that with more standardization, the network driver support will have
much less difference between different vendors implementation than all the
different ALSA drivers.  That was my primary concern with a JACK-only
implementation vs. making it ALSA compatible, since only limited
applications support JACK currently, likely there would be fewer
developers willing to work on a JACK only implementation compared to
something which will work more generally.

Yes, that sounds like the ideal case.  Is there a way to quantify "simple"
client?  How much work would that entail, and what kernel or userspace
support is assumed?

Partly I was mixing up AVB and Ravenna, but partly the problem is because
three different people were writing, and I think each of us has different
ideas about what is required as a minimum, and what is desired beyond that
minimum.

OK, that is a starting point then.

Yes, I understand, but hopefully Ravenna can scale down to this type of
small configuration gracefully.
