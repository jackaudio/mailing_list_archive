for various reasons, i ended up implementing an ALSA userspace driver
("PCM Plugin") in january as part of a short term contract job. i can
assure you that ALSA is entirely capable of doing this, and it can all
be done in user space assuming there is working stack to build on.
this seems to me to be the main source of concern, because the
situation with (e.g.) firewire for audio has, from my rather remote
perspective, been nothing but a nightmare for all concerned.  i can
see reasons to believe that AVB/Ravenna could be different, but can
also imagine it turning in much the same way: multiple implementations
for the kernel side, with all the faffing around that this then
triggers higher up the stack.
