i dont really understand this.
you mean streaming from harddisk to multiple endpoints,
all playing phase synced ?

with soundcards that generate their own clocks, and dont allow for rate
control ?

if one allows 3ms of diff, we can do this with netjack for quite some
time. 3ms is not relevant for comsumer applications imo.

if the soundcard allow software to gradually adjust the clock, we could
do this without resampling.
the problems start when there is packet loss and high jitter.
(such as an internet connection over the atlantic or somthing, here it
gets interesting.)

you mean an audio nic in a computer ?
or in the embedded audio soundcard ?

well... there seems to be some silicon out there....
ptp patches seem to be ready for mainlining. and will probably hit the
tip tree soon.
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg116310.html

with a reasonably good ptp timer in the kernel.
this is all easy stuff.
