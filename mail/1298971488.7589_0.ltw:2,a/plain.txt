Don't get me wrong, but may I, for once, question this assumption?
I know there are some remote jamming tools available, but I don't know a
single musician using them.

Given the inherent latency on the WAN, there's no real "together"
anyway, so the whole thing degrades to simple asynchronous streaming.
(read: icecast or whatsoever)

If you know a sane use case where one needs a distributed synchronous
transatlantic setup, then I'll stand corrected, but within this
AVB/Ravenna discussion, let's talk LAN and only LAN.



Cheers
