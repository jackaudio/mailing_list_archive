thanks for a demotivating me.

you deleted the part about LAN.
tip:core/timers is already carrying code for in kernel ptp clocks.

there are patches for IXP46x, National Semiconductor PHYTER and MPC85xx
that build up on this.

as i see it... we could make a 10lines patch to the dummy device,
and have jack synced to a ptp clock.

then you just need a non-resampling rtp streamer.
