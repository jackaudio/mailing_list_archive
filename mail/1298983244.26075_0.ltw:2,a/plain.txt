Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Writing an IEEE 802.1BA (AVB) compliant network backend, for Jack2

hi again,

i think we should met at the LAC2011, i already participate :-) maybe we 
should announce a short presentation with intensive discussion on that?

i could present my bachelor thesis presentation...

we could use a AVB mailing list for linux applications?


BUT:

AVB needs special switches with respect to time sensitive forwarding and 
queueing, MAC multicasting, mac stream reservation...

WHY AVB:
i want to participate in opensource projects and i think that is the 
only way software developers should go.
so i want to use open standards and no properiterians...

WHY JACK:
i love jack (Thank you Paul!)
and i see i lot of potential building complet digital studio 
applications using jack and its environment, supported with avb hardware...

PTP BY BARTKY:

    Christoph,

    Yes, ptpv2d will run with standard PC hardware under Linux.

    You will not get as good of a time resolution/accuracy as you can in
    systems
    that have hardware timestamping of PTP packets, but you still can
    use it on
    a PC and you can get accuracy down in the Microsecond resolution on
    a local
    area network.

    Hope this helps,

    Best regards,

    Alan
