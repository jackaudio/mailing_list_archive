&gt;&gt; To implement AVB, the intention (as far as Jack would be concerned)
&gt;&gt; would be to get a NIC card that will most definitely implement the
&gt;&gt; timing protocol. A consumer app that only does streaming is the
&gt;&gt; "killer app"; and that was the only concern of Broadcom and Marvell
&gt;&gt; -- who were major participants. This does not concern itself with
&gt;&gt; latency, but rather with delivery. These apps stream with virtual
&gt;&gt; timing from disk. Then the reproduce to iPods that will recover
&gt;&gt; timing as cheaply as possible to achieve robust buffering with
&gt;&gt; fairly low jitter playback.
&gt; i dont really understand this.
&gt; you mean streaming from harddisk to multiple endpoints,
&gt; all playing phase synced ?
Yes
&gt; with soundcards that generate their own clocks, and dont allow for rate
&gt; control ?
No. ... SRC would be needed for these
&gt; if one allows 3ms of diff, we can do this with netjack for quite some
&gt; time. 3ms is not relevant for comsumer applications imo.
3 ms of difference is not a rate difference, only time difference. Time 
difference grows unbounded for a frequency difference between the source 
and the sink. There will be a jitter buffer xrun at a periodic rate for 
that situation.
&gt; if the soundcard allow software to gradually adjust the clock, we could
&gt; do this without resampling.
&gt; the problems start when there is packet loss and high jitter.
&gt; (such as an internet connection over the atlantic or somthing, here it
&gt; gets interesting.)
I didn't know that there were sound cards that allow fine-set frequency 
control to allow implementation of a good low-jitter PLL.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The anticipated audio app (consumer or pro) is that a VERY SPECIAL
&gt;&gt; Audio NIC would be created that would buffer the stream and present
&gt;&gt; it to the hardware with a strict-timed interrupt and look like an
&gt;&gt; audio card. That card has an analog Phase-Locked-Loop controlled by
&gt;&gt; the AVB (which is a derivative of IEEE 1588) and the timing
&gt;&gt; information in the stream control of IEEE 1788.
&gt; you mean an audio nic in a computer ?
&gt; or in the embedded audio soundcard ?
&gt;
Can be done either way. The anticipated case would be a NIC that has an 
appearance that looks like a sound card. Otherwise, (conceptually, not 
designed AFAIK) the timestamped 1788 packets could be sent to a 
soundcard to implement PTP's PLL.
&gt;&gt; Such NICs will become available on a very long schedule, and a
&gt;&gt; company called Lab-X can point you to vendors leading the way.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps someone from the Jack core crew should speak to Lee Minich
&gt;&gt; at Lab-X about a push to open some for driver work. There is also an
&gt;&gt; industry alliance for AVB, AVnu (Akin to the dreaded Firewire
&gt;&gt; industry alliance.)
&gt; well... there seems to be some silicon out there....
&gt; ptp patches seem to be ready for mainlining. and will probably hit the
&gt; tip tree soon.
&gt; http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg116310.html
&gt;
&gt; with a reasonably good ptp timer in the kernel.
&gt; this is all easy stuff.
&gt;
REALLY GLAD to see that the PHYTER has made it into the source tree. I 
am amazed that it has gone this quickly.

Kernel PLLs, however, will have lots of jitter. Once again, consumer 
will be OK (maybe some surging and low-freq noise like USB externals I 
know.) The adaption from a PTP aware PHY to allow paced pay-out of 
packets to D/As or to allow a D/A to drive the PTP as a master is 
brilliant. Without a PLL-able sound card, though, SRC must be done the 
hard way, in software.
