&gt; &gt;&gt;I sat on the IEEE1788 standards committee when we were working on

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;To implement AVB, the intention (as far as Jack would be concerned)
&gt; &gt;&gt;would be to get a NIC card that will most definitely implement the
&gt; &gt;&gt;timing protocol. A consumer app that only does streaming is the
&gt; &gt;&gt;"killer app"; and that was the only concern of Broadcom and Marvell
&gt; &gt;&gt;-- who were major participants. This does not concern itself with
&gt; &gt;&gt;latency, but rather with delivery. These apps stream with virtual
&gt; &gt;&gt;timing from disk. Then the reproduce to iPods that will recover
&gt; &gt;&gt;timing as cheaply as possible to achieve robust buffering with
&gt; &gt;&gt;fairly low jitter playback.
&gt; &gt;i dont really understand this.
&gt; &gt;you mean streaming from harddisk to multiple endpoints,
&gt; &gt;all playing phase synced ?
&gt; Yes
&gt; &gt;with soundcards that generate their own clocks, and dont allow for rate
&gt; &gt;control ?
&gt; No. ... SRC would be needed for these
&gt; &gt;if one allows 3ms of diff, we can do this with netjack for quite some
&gt; &gt;time. 3ms is not relevant for comsumer applications imo.
&gt; 3 ms of difference is not a rate difference, only time difference.
&gt; Time difference grows unbounded for a frequency difference between
&gt; the source and the sink. There will be a jitter buffer xrun at a
&gt; periodic rate for that situation.

i wasnt talking about rate differences.
the resampling happens in the alsa_out module. 
anyways.... lets talk avb.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;The anticipated audio app (consumer or pro) is that a VERY SPECIAL
&gt; &gt;&gt;Audio NIC would be created that would buffer the stream and present
&gt; &gt;&gt;it to the hardware with a strict-timed interrupt and look like an
&gt; &gt;&gt;audio card. That card has an analog Phase-Locked-Loop controlled by
&gt; &gt;&gt;the AVB (which is a derivative of IEEE 1588) and the timing
&gt; &gt;&gt;information in the stream control of IEEE 1788.
&gt; &gt;you mean an audio nic in a computer ?
&gt; &gt;or in the embedded audio soundcard ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Can be done either way. The anticipated case would be a NIC that has
&gt; an appearance that looks like a sound card. Otherwise,
&gt; (conceptually, not designed AFAIK) the timestamped 1788 packets
&gt; could be sent to a soundcard to implement PTP's PLL.

i dont see a need for a NIC that looks like a soundcard.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Such NICs will become available on a very long schedule, and a
&gt; &gt;&gt;company called Lab-X can point you to vendors leading the way.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Perhaps someone from the Jack core crew should speak to Lee Minich
&gt; &gt;&gt;at Lab-X about a push to open some for driver work. There is also an
&gt; &gt;&gt;industry alliance for AVB, AVnu (Akin to the dreaded Firewire
&gt; &gt;&gt;industry alliance.)
&gt; &gt;well... there seems to be some silicon out there....
&gt; &gt;ptp patches seem to be ready for mainlining. and will probably hit the
&gt; &gt;tip tree soon.
&gt; &gt;http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg116310.html
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;with a reasonably good ptp timer in the kernel.
&gt; &gt;this is all easy stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; REALLY GLAD to see that the PHYTER has made it into the source tree.
&gt; I am amazed that it has gone this quickly.

its not inside the source tree yet. but i think it will be there soon.

&gt; 
&gt; Kernel PLLs, however, will have lots of jitter. Once again, consumer
&gt; will be OK (maybe some surging and low-freq noise like USB externals
&gt; I know.) The adaption from a PTP aware PHY to allow paced pay-out of
&gt; packets to D/As or to allow a D/A to drive the PTP as a master is
&gt; brilliant. Without a PLL-able sound card, though, SRC must be done
&gt; the hard way, in software.

not if that soundcard is the only one, and the ptp master clock.


my real question is now is: does the assumption holds, that the ptp master
clock can also serve as CLOCK_REALTIME ?

the current kernel patches allow for accessing ptp clocks inside network
cards. but there is no software clock yet. so in the software case ptpd
will end up servoing CLOCK_REALTIME. i dont think that is desired, and
there should be a software ptp clock too, if the NIC doesnt have one.
