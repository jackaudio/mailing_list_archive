I'm not a coder. Could you do it for me? Please? :-)

I like layering tons of vocals by myself, and changing the sample rate 
between takes or between lines (a) makes it sound like it's not just me 
singing, and (b) makes notes that I previously couldn't reach, reachable.

It works better with my clarinet, which still sounds natural when its 
frequencies are scaled, but it works OK for my voice up to a few semitones.

But you are right, you really have to plan these things ahead of time, 
or you can paint yourself into a corner very easily.
