&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To implement AVB, the intention (as far as Jack would be concerned)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be to get a NIC card that will most definitely implement the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timing protocol. A consumer app that only does streaming is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "killer app"; and that was the only concern of Broadcom and Marvell
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- who were major participants. This does not concern itself with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; latency, but rather with delivery. These apps stream with virtual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timing from disk. Then the reproduce to iPods that will recover
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; timing as cheaply as possible to achieve robust buffering with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fairly low jitter playback.
&gt;&gt;&gt; i dont really understand this.
&gt;&gt;&gt; you mean streaming from harddisk to multiple endpoints,
&gt;&gt;&gt; all playing phase synced ?
&gt;&gt; Yes
&gt;&gt;&gt; with soundcards that generate their own clocks, and dont allow for rate
&gt;&gt;&gt; control ?
&gt;&gt; No. ... SRC would be needed for these
&gt;&gt;&gt; if one allows 3ms of diff, we can do this with netjack for quite some
&gt;&gt;&gt; time. 3ms is not relevant for comsumer applications imo.
&gt;&gt; 3 ms of difference is not a rate difference, only time difference.
&gt;&gt; Time difference grows unbounded for a frequency difference between
&gt;&gt; the source and the sink. There will be a jitter buffer xrun at a
&gt;&gt; periodic rate for that situation.
&gt; i wasnt talking about rate differences.
&gt; the resampling happens in the alsa_out module.
&gt; anyways.... lets talk avb.
Okeedokee (pardon my american slang.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The anticipated audio app (consumer or pro) is that a VERY SPECIAL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Audio NIC would be created that would buffer the stream and present
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it to the hardware with a strict-timed interrupt and look like an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; audio card. That card has an analog Phase-Locked-Loop controlled by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the AVB (which is a derivative of IEEE 1588) and the timing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information in the stream control of IEEE 1788.
&gt;&gt;&gt; you mean an audio nic in a computer ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; or in the embedded audio soundcard ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can be done either way. The anticipated case would be a NIC that has
&gt;&gt; an appearance that looks like a sound card. Otherwise,
&gt;&gt; (conceptually, not designed AFAIK) the timestamped 1788 packets
&gt;&gt; could be sent to a soundcard to implement PTP's PLL.
&gt; i dont see a need for a NIC that looks like a soundcard.
&gt;
This **was** the anticipated use case. I have been spoiled by pro audio. 
I am dis-satisfied if the clock jitter is worse than 500 ps. 50 ps RMS 
was my goal and no kernel-timed PLL will ever get there. Furthermore, 
the nature of the kernel jitter statistics hides the real excursions to 
some extent. Peak vs. RMS ... Peak is what leads to the audible effects. 
But, this is way down in the noise for sensible humans. The ability to 
hear this only shows in an extremely clean listening environment. I'm 
splitting hairs, so you might want to take my input a little guardedly.

Once again ... AVB was designed for this very accurate timing domain, 
the anticipated case was to have a PLL directly in the NIC to derive a 
word clock.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Such NICs will become available on a very long schedule, and a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company called Lab-X can point you to vendors leading the way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps someone from the Jack core crew should speak to Lee Minich
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at Lab-X about a push to open some for driver work. There is also an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; industry alliance for AVB, AVnu (Akin to the dreaded Firewire
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; industry alliance.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; well... there seems to be some silicon out there....
&gt;&gt;&gt; ptp patches seem to be ready for mainlining. and will probably hit the
&gt;&gt;&gt; tip tree soon.
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg116310.html
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a reasonably good ptp timer in the kernel.
&gt;&gt;&gt; this is all easy stuff.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; REALLY GLAD to see that the PHYTER has made it into the source tree.
&gt;&gt; I am amazed that it has gone this quickly.
&gt; its not inside the source tree yet. but i think it will be there soon.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Kernel PLLs, however, will have lots of jitter. Once again, consumer
&gt;&gt; will be OK (maybe some surging and low-freq noise like USB externals
&gt;&gt; I know.) The adaption from a PTP aware PHY to allow paced pay-out of
&gt;&gt; packets to D/As or to allow a D/A to drive the PTP as a master is
&gt;&gt; brilliant. Without a PLL-able sound card, though, SRC must be done
&gt;&gt; the hard way, in software.
&gt; not if that soundcard is the only one, and the ptp master clock.
True. But be careful of the word master clock. This is a reserved word 
in the PTP dictionary and can only be the physical Ethernet bit clock in 
the NIC. The soundcard interrupt can then be a 1788 Stream master clock 
carried within the PTP framework.
&gt;
&gt; my real question is now is: does the assumption holds, that the ptp master
&gt; clock can also serve as CLOCK_REALTIME ?

The PTP clocks are definitely only for relative timing. Their roll-over 
was intended to be longer than days, for equipment design convenience 
reasons, but were not designed to be UTC epoch based. IEEE 1588, the 
grandfather of PTP, is designed to have an epoc application and so you 
will find those extra fields over in that spec. Given the low jitter of 
PTP, as a CLOCK_REALTIME, for most RTC applications which I have used 
over the years, that accuracy would be like polishing a brick. If it's 
convenient to derive a RTC from a PTP counter, by correlating with some 
NTP stack, then go for it. But the warning there is that the PTP clock 
is not traceable to NTP so it will diverge from NTP time without the 
same kind of periodic reinforcement that NTP sub-systems typically demand.

If you wanted to drive the other way, have an NTP stack inform a PTP 
Master node of UTC to tweak its frequency, then you would have done the 
little brother of what the Telephony industry has done with its Rubidium 
clocks reinforced by GPS tracking.
&gt; the current kernel patches allow for accessing ptp clocks inside network
&gt; cards. but there is no software clock yet. so in the software case ptpd
&gt; will end up servoing CLOCK_REALTIME. i dont think that is desired, and
&gt; there should be a software ptp clock too, if the NIC doesnt have one.
&gt;

If the NIC doesn't have one, the timestamp resolution of a kernel PTP is 
one jiffy. This would be disaster in trying to correlate a sound card's 
interrupts to that kernel PTP. Remember that PTP critically depends on 
timestamps which are precisely at the leading edge of an Ethernet frame; 
whereas many NICs post their received frames whenever they get around to 
it. This would allow 4 ms of uncertainty in the timestamp of the PTP 
probe/response sequences from kernel resolution alone. PTP demands 40 ns 
of accuracy at a minimum. Most PTP clock nodes could fail to converge a 
grandmaster with that much jitter (best guess.)

Do you know of software-only PTP clocks anywhere? Broadcom and Marvell 
have implemented NIC &amp; switch/server chips which have very fast ARM 
processors in the silicon to service the PTP timestamps before the end 
of an Ethernet frame has even fully arrived inside the MAC. 
Hard-Real-Time Assembly programming, I assume.

The AES-11 frequency accuracy (Grade-2) spec of 10 ppm for a clock is 
nice, but probably won't be present in any PTP stream from anyone I know 
of except Apogee. Absolute frequency is not AVB's strength. The local 
clock on the motherboard, servoed to NTP will be good enough. What 
application might demand such low jitter RTC?

Otherwise, high-resolution timing will require a whole new subsystem.

I guess don't understand you desired link between PTP and CLOCK_REALTIME.
