This **was** the anticipated use case. I have been spoiled by pro audio. 
I am dis-satisfied if the clock jitter is worse than 500 ps. 50 ps RMS 
was my goal and no kernel-timed PLL will ever get there. Furthermore, 
the nature of the kernel jitter statistics hides the real excursions to 
some extent. Peak vs. RMS ... Peak is what leads to the audible effects. 
But, this is way down in the noise for sensible humans. The ability to 
hear this only shows in an extremely clean listening environment. I'm 
splitting hairs, so you might want to take my input a little guardedly.

Once again ... AVB was designed for this very accurate timing domain, 
the anticipated case was to have a PLL directly in the NIC to derive a 
word clock.

True. But be careful of the word master clock. This is a reserved word 
in the PTP dictionary and can only be the physical Ethernet bit clock in 
the NIC. The soundcard interrupt can then be a 1788 Stream master clock 
carried within the PTP framework.

The PTP clocks are definitely only for relative timing. Their roll-over 
was intended to be longer than days, for equipment design convenience 
reasons, but were not designed to be UTC epoch based. IEEE 1588, the 
grandfather of PTP, is designed to have an epoc application and so you 
will find those extra fields over in that spec. Given the low jitter of 
PTP, as a CLOCK_REALTIME, for most RTC applications which I have used 
over the years, that accuracy would be like polishing a brick. If it's 
convenient to derive a RTC from a PTP counter, by correlating with some 
NTP stack, then go for it. But the warning there is that the PTP clock 
is not traceable to NTP so it will diverge from NTP time without the 
same kind of periodic reinforcement that NTP sub-systems typically demand.

If you wanted to drive the other way, have an NTP stack inform a PTP 
Master node of UTC to tweak its frequency, then you would have done the 
little brother of what the Telephony industry has done with its Rubidium 
clocks reinforced by GPS tracking.

If the NIC doesn't have one, the timestamp resolution of a kernel PTP is 
one jiffy. This would be disaster in trying to correlate a sound card's 
interrupts to that kernel PTP. Remember that PTP critically depends on 
timestamps which are precisely at the leading edge of an Ethernet frame; 
whereas many NICs post their received frames whenever they get around to 
it. This would allow 4 ms of uncertainty in the timestamp of the PTP 
probe/response sequences from kernel resolution alone. PTP demands 40 ns 
of accuracy at a minimum. Most PTP clock nodes could fail to converge a 
grandmaster with that much jitter (best guess.)

Do you know of software-only PTP clocks anywhere? Broadcom and Marvell 
have implemented NIC & switch/server chips which have very fast ARM 
processors in the silicon to service the PTP timestamps before the end 
of an Ethernet frame has even fully arrived inside the MAC. 
Hard-Real-Time Assembly programming, I assume.

The AES-11 frequency accuracy (Grade-2) spec of 10 ppm for a clock is 
nice, but probably won't be present in any PTP stream from anyone I know 
of except Apogee. Absolute frequency is not AVB's strength. The local 
clock on the motherboard, servoed to NTP will be good enough. What 
application might demand such low jitter RTC?

Otherwise, high-resolution timing will require a whole new subsystem.

I guess don't understand you desired link between PTP and CLOCK_REALTIME.
