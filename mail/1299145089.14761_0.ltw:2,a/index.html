&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To implement AVB, the intention (as far as Jack would be concerned)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would be to get a NIC card that will most definitely implement the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;timing protocol. A consumer app that only does streaming is the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"killer app"; and that was the only concern of Broadcom and Marvell
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- who were major participants. This does not concern itself with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;latency, but rather with delivery. These apps stream with virtual
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;timing from disk. Then the reproduce to iPods that will recover
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;timing as cheaply as possible to achieve robust buffering with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fairly low jitter playback.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;i dont really understand this.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you mean streaming from harddisk to multiple endpoints,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;all playing phase synced ?
&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with soundcards that generate their own clocks, and dont allow for rate
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;control ?
&gt; &gt;&gt;No. ... SRC would be needed for these
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;if one allows 3ms of diff, we can do this with netjack for quite some
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;time. 3ms is not relevant for comsumer applications imo.
&gt; &gt;&gt;3 ms of difference is not a rate difference, only time difference.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Time difference grows unbounded for a frequency difference between
&gt; &gt;&gt;the source and the sink. There will be a jitter buffer xrun at a
&gt; &gt;&gt;periodic rate for that situation.
&gt; &gt;i wasnt talking about rate differences.
&gt; &gt;the resampling happens in the alsa_out module.
&gt; &gt;anyways.... lets talk avb.
&gt; Okeedokee (pardon my american slang.)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The anticipated audio app (consumer or pro) is that a VERY SPECIAL
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Audio NIC would be created that would buffer the stream and present
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it to the hardware with a strict-timed interrupt and look like an
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;audio card. That card has an analog Phase-Locked-Loop controlled by
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the AVB (which is a derivative of IEEE 1588) and the timing
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;information in the stream control of IEEE 1788.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;you mean an audio nic in a computer ?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;or in the embedded audio soundcard ?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Can be done either way. The anticipated case would be a NIC that has
&gt; &gt;&gt;an appearance that looks like a sound card. Otherwise,
&gt; &gt;&gt;(conceptually, not designed AFAIK) the timestamped 1788 packets
&gt; &gt;&gt;could be sent to a soundcard to implement PTP's PLL.
&gt; &gt;i dont see a need for a NIC that looks like a soundcard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This **was** the anticipated use case. I have been spoiled by pro
&gt; audio. I am dis-satisfied if the clock jitter is worse than 500 ps.
&gt; 50 ps RMS was my goal and no kernel-timed PLL will ever get there.
&gt; Furthermore, the nature of the kernel jitter statistics hides the
&gt; real excursions to some extent. Peak vs. RMS ... Peak is what leads
&gt; to the audible effects. But, this is way down in the noise for
&gt; sensible humans. The ability to hear this only shows in an extremely
&gt; clean listening environment. I'm splitting hairs, so you might want
&gt; to take my input a little guardedly.
&gt; 
&gt; Once again ... AVB was designed for this very accurate timing
&gt; domain, the anticipated case was to have a PLL directly in the NIC
&gt; to derive a word clock.

yeah. but you only need this accuracy in somthing that actually emits
samples at the wordclock rate.
a computer, thats only supposed to send an RTP stream, which should be
played with a latency of a few ms doesnt need picosecond accuracy.


&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Such NICs will become available on a very long schedule, and a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;company called Lab-X can point you to vendors leading the way.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perhaps someone from the Jack core crew should speak to Lee Minich
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at Lab-X about a push to open some for driver work. There is also an
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;industry alliance for AVB, AVnu (Akin to the dreaded Firewire
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;industry alliance.)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;well... there seems to be some silicon out there....
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;ptp patches seem to be ready for mainlining. and will probably hit the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tip tree soon.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg116310.html
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with a reasonably good ptp timer in the kernel.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;this is all easy stuff.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;REALLY GLAD to see that the PHYTER has made it into the source tree.
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am amazed that it has gone this quickly.
&gt; &gt;its not inside the source tree yet. but i think it will be there soon.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Kernel PLLs, however, will have lots of jitter. Once again, consumer
&gt; &gt;&gt;will be OK (maybe some surging and low-freq noise like USB externals
&gt; &gt;&gt;I know.) The adaption from a PTP aware PHY to allow paced pay-out of
&gt; &gt;&gt;packets to D/As or to allow a D/A to drive the PTP as a master is
&gt; &gt;&gt;brilliant. Without a PLL-able sound card, though, SRC must be done
&gt; &gt;&gt;the hard way, in software.
&gt; &gt;not if that soundcard is the only one, and the ptp master clock.
&gt; True. But be careful of the word master clock. This is a reserved
&gt; word in the PTP dictionary and can only be the physical Ethernet bit
&gt; clock in the NIC. The soundcard interrupt can then be a 1788 Stream
&gt; master clock carried within the PTP framework.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;my real question is now is: does the assumption holds, that the ptp master
&gt; &gt;clock can also serve as CLOCK_REALTIME ?
&gt; 
&gt; The PTP clocks are definitely only for relative timing. Their
&gt; roll-over was intended to be longer than days, for equipment design
&gt; convenience reasons, but were not designed to be UTC epoch based.
&gt; IEEE 1588, the grandfather of PTP, is designed to have an epoc
&gt; application and so you will find those extra fields over in that
&gt; spec. Given the low jitter of PTP, as a CLOCK_REALTIME, for most RTC
&gt; applications which I have used over the years, that accuracy would
&gt; be like polishing a brick. If it's convenient to derive a RTC from a
&gt; PTP counter, by correlating with some NTP stack, then go for it. But
&gt; the warning there is that the PTP clock is not traceable to NTP so
&gt; it will diverge from NTP time without the same kind of periodic
&gt; reinforcement that NTP sub-systems typically demand.

i dont want to do that. its just that kernel people seem to have
rejected the idea of a software ptp clock, because they considered
clock_realtime to be this software clock.

with your statement, i have a case for the need of a software clock, i
think. 


&gt; 
&gt; If you wanted to drive the other way, have an NTP stack inform a PTP
&gt; Master node of UTC to tweak its frequency, then you would have done
&gt; the little brother of what the Telephony industry has done with its
&gt; Rubidium clocks reinforced by GPS tracking.
&gt; &gt;the current kernel patches allow for accessing ptp clocks inside network
&gt; &gt;cards. but there is no software clock yet. so in the software case ptpd
&gt; &gt;will end up servoing CLOCK_REALTIME. i dont think that is desired, and
&gt; &gt;there should be a software ptp clock too, if the NIC doesnt have one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; If the NIC doesn't have one, the timestamp resolution of a kernel
&gt; PTP is one jiffy. This would be disaster in trying to correlate a
&gt; sound card's interrupts to that kernel PTP. Remember that PTP
&gt; critically depends on timestamps which are precisely at the leading
&gt; edge of an Ethernet frame; whereas many NICs post their received
&gt; frames whenever they get around to it. This would allow 4 ms of
&gt; uncertainty in the timestamp of the PTP probe/response sequences
&gt; from kernel resolution alone. PTP demands 40 ns of accuracy at a
&gt; minimum. Most PTP clock nodes could fail to converge a grandmaster
&gt; with that much jitter (best guess.)

you are assuming, that the target machine actually has a
soundcard. my use-case here is that i want to connect some laptop to an
AVB site, and be able to use the AVB infrastructure from this laptop.

i only need an accuracy which is of the order of the desired latency.

if that machine cant be a grandmaster... well... then thats the case.
i am pretty confident, that i can extract a clock under most conditions
in a LAN.
(i have a clock servo that can lock with 128 samples of jitter on the
timestamps (its a bit expensive in terms of cpu, but it works))

&gt; 
&gt; Do you know of software-only PTP clocks anywhere? Broadcom and
&gt; Marvell have implemented NIC &amp; switch/server chips which have very
&gt; fast ARM processors in the silicon to service the PTP timestamps
&gt; before the end of an Ethernet frame has even fully arrived inside
&gt; the MAC. Hard-Real-Time Assembly programming, I assume.
&gt; 
&gt; The AES-11 frequency accuracy (Grade-2) spec of 10 ppm for a clock
&gt; is nice, but probably won't be present in any PTP stream from anyone
&gt; I know of except Apogee. Absolute frequency is not AVB's strength.
&gt; The local clock on the motherboard, servoed to NTP will be good
&gt; enough. What application might demand such low jitter RTC?
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, high-resolution timing will require a whole new subsystem.

there is hrtimer :)

&gt; 
&gt; I guess don't understand you desired link between PTP and CLOCK_REALTIME.

i dont desire it.
