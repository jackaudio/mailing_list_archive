You would never use a software PLL to drive the sampling clock of an ADC
or DAC.  It would have to be a hardware clock, with a very long time
constant (low corner frequency on the PLL loop filter) to keep the
sampling clock and the PTP derived clock in synchronization.

&gt; Once again ... AVB was designed for this very accurate timing
&gt; domain, the anticipated case was to have a PLL directly in the NIC
&gt; to derive a word clock.

Yes, the ADC or DAC would definitely have a PLL.  You don't need that in
the PC, however.  It gets confusing now that both the PC and the audio
equipment have network interfaces.  We need to be clear what type of
device we are talking about, because the requirements are drastically
different.

&gt; True. But be careful of the word master clock. This is a reserved
&gt; word in the PTP dictionary and can only be the physical Ethernet
&gt; bit clock in the NIC.

Are you sure about that?  I've been looking at all the 1588 information I
can find, and I don't see anywhere that the PTP clock is referenced to the
Ethernet phy clock.  Am I missing something?  I'll see if I can get the
full IEEE spec.  If you have a reference to a particular section in the
standard, I'll take a look.  I have the 2002 spec, but the IEEE server is
having problems serving up the 2008 spec, so I'll have to get that sorted
later.


&gt; The soundcard interrupt can then be a 1788 Stream master clock
&gt; carried within the PTP framework.

You've mentioned 1788 several times.  Do you actually mean 1588?  Or is
there some connection between IEEE1788 and clock synchronization?  I
suspect you mean 1588, "IEEE Standard for a Precision Clock
Synchronization Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems."

&gt; IEEE 1588, the grandfather of PTP,

1588=PTP.  Grandfather would seem to imply that PTP is some recent
descendent.  PTPv1 is IEEE1588-2002, and PTPv2 is IEEE1588-2008.

Perhaps you mean that 1588 is the father of 802.1AS  That is an Ethernet
specific implementation of 1588, and the spec is not finalized yet.

&gt;&gt; the current kernel patches allow for accessing ptp clocks
&gt;&gt; inside network cards. but there is no software clock yet.
...
&gt; Do you know of software-only PTP clocks anywhere?

I believe the link I previously provided implements a software clock.
http://ptpd.sourceforge.net/
There are a couple of others, not sure which is likely to be best
developed.  These seem to be a newer fork of an older project:
http://ptpd2.sourceforge.net/
http://ptpd1.sourceforge.net/

&gt; If the NIC doesn't have one, the timestamp resolution
&gt; of a kernel PTP is one jiffy.

I think Torben already pointed out that you would probably use high
resolution timers, and not the jiffy based timers.

&gt; The AES-11 frequency accuracy (Grade-2) spec of 10 ppm for a
&gt; clock is nice, but probably won't be present in any PTP stream
&gt; from anyone I know of except Apogee.

The time and instrumentation guys will definitely have better than that.  
You can already get PTP clocks from Symmetricom which will lock to GPS and
give you long term accuracies better than 1ppb (10^-9).
http://www.symmetricom.com/products/ieee-1588-ptp-solutions/

&gt; Absolute frequency is not AVB's strength. The local clock
&gt; on the motherboard, servoed to NTP will be good enough.
&gt; What application might demand such low jitter RTC?

Absolute frequency accuracy and jitter are independent concepts.  There is
no reason that the long term average frequency could not approach
trivially close to 0 error if you are locked to a stratum 1 source such as
GPS.
Jitter is a more difficult issue, and you will have the same kinds of
problems deriving a frame or bit clock from PTP as from Firewire. 
Probably worse, you will definitely need a lot of jitter attenuation on
your sampling clock PLL.

I think we're getting off track here, though. This is jack-devel, not
network-attached-audio-equipment-devel.  Let's start with the expectation
that someone else (or at least on a different mailing list) will make some
hardware that uses PTP to synchronize sampling clocks, does it properly
with lots of jitter attenuation, does it in a way that is AVB compliant,
and has some higher level protocol that we can use, probably based on
RTP/UDP/IP.
At that point, JACK just has to make sure it sends groups of packets with
audio samples, not too fast to overrun the buffers, not too slow to
underrun the buffers.  That should be feasible with a software clock
implementation, either using hardware assist in the NIC, or (hopefully)
using a fully software implemented solution so that current generation
hardware without explicit PTP support can be used.
