IEEE 1722 (I apologize for getting the number wrong perviously) 
specifies the PTP that is a subset for AVB. It most definitely does not 
have epoch in it and is not traceable to Greenwich. Don't try to use PTP 
as a replacement for NTP. Even IEEE1588 for instruments doesn't require 
epoch.

Now we're way far afield of Jack.

&gt;&gt; I think Torben already pointed out that you would probably use high
&gt;&gt; resolution timers, and not the jiffy based timers.
&gt; yeah. they have nanoseconds resolution, and the only problem is that
&gt; querying them takes some time. but i think we are in the order of a few
&gt; ns here.
&gt;
&gt; but i think its true, that the current software time stamping is jiffy
&gt; based. i fix that on the way, though.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The AES-11 frequency accuracy (Grade-2) spec of 10 ppm for a
&gt;&gt;&gt; clock is nice, but probably won't be present in any PTP stream
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone I know of except Apogee.
&gt;&gt; The time and instrumentation guys will definitely have better than that.
&gt;&gt; You can already get PTP clocks from Symmetricom which will lock to GPS and
&gt;&gt; give you long term accuracies better than 1ppb (10^-9).
&gt;&gt; http://www.symmetricom.com/products/ieee-1588-ptp-solutions/
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolute frequency is not AVB's strength. The local clock
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the motherboard, servoed to NTP will be good enough.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What application might demand such low jitter RTC?
&gt;&gt; Absolute frequency accuracy and jitter are independent concepts.  There is
&gt;&gt; no reason that the long term average frequency could not approach
&gt;&gt; trivially close to 0 error if you are locked to a stratum 1 source such as
&gt;&gt; GPS.
&gt;&gt; Jitter is a more difficult issue, and you will have the same kinds of
&gt;&gt; problems deriving a frame or bit clock from PTP as from Firewire.
&gt;&gt; Probably worse, you will definitely need a lot of jitter attenuation on
&gt;&gt; your sampling clock PLL.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think we're getting off track here, though. This is jack-devel, not
&gt;&gt; network-attached-audio-equipment-devel.  Let's start with the expectation
&gt;&gt; that someone else (or at least on a different mailing list) will make some
&gt;&gt; hardware that uses PTP to synchronize sampling clocks, does it properly
&gt;&gt; with lots of jitter attenuation, does it in a way that is AVB compliant,
&gt;&gt; and has some higher level protocol that we can use, probably based on
&gt;&gt; RTP/UDP/IP.
&gt;&gt; At that point, JACK just has to make sure it sends groups of packets with
&gt;&gt; audio samples, not too fast to overrun the buffers, not too slow to
&gt;&gt; underrun the buffers.  That should be feasible with a software clock
&gt;&gt; implementation, either using hardware assist in the NIC, or (hopefully)
&gt;&gt; using a fully software implemented solution so that current generation
&gt;&gt; hardware without explicit PTP support can be used.
&gt; my question about the suitability of the ptp clock to drive
&gt; clock_realtime is based on the fact that the kernel people do not want
&gt; to introduce different timebases (posix clocks) into the kernel, if
&gt; there are no real reasons.
&gt;
&gt; if the ptp clock, was derived from gps, and was epoch based. there is
&gt; actually no reason. we can just servo CLOCK_REALTIME to it, and do our
&gt; timing based on this.
&gt;
&gt; but if that clock was crap. (iE out of some network loudspeakers with a
&gt; future $10 avb chip...) i wouldnt want that to be clock_realtime.
&gt;
&gt; if we can cite the standard draft with some requirements for the clock,
&gt; which are unacceptable for clock_realtime, we would have a good argument
&gt; for maintaining the avb clock as a different timebase inside the kernel.
