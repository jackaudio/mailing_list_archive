Subject:     [Jack-Devel] 801.BA Auto Discovery of devices

Hi again,

after that inspiring discussion about precise timing, i have another avb 
related topic.
i think i will come up with several topics related to avb in the next 
months.

one of avbs benefits shall be auto discovery.
but i dont see that with IP!?
would it be possible, to utilize a NetBIOS like protocol for addressing 
devices? OSC via UDP via NetBIOS via MAC/LLC ... ?
until now i have no clue, how addressing shall work without IP...
all the people are talking about RTP and Ravenna...
but how do they interconnect without using an IP based net with DHCP server?


Bye
Ck
