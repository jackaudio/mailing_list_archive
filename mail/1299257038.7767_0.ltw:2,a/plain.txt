Ravenna (and AVB) definitely use IP. You need IP for UDP...

The most common (or future-proof) service discoveries are Bonjour/Zeroconf, 
SLP and UPnP. Ravenna seems to use Bonjour as this also provides a way to 
autoconfigure IP addresses when there is no DHCP on the net...

I also enjoy the discussions about AVB on this list. I would also be okay when 
it moves to the lad-list though.

Have a nice weekend,

Arnold
