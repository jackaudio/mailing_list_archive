&gt; I don't like the way IEEE draft standards are so hard to get. I can't
&gt; really find the full standard which is currently proposed for 802.1AS (the
&gt; synchronization standard), but here is what the working group page says:
&gt; http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1as.html
&gt;
&gt; "This standard specifies the protocol and procedures used to ensure that
&gt; the synchronization requirements are met for time sensitive applications,
&gt; such as audio and video, across Bridged and Virtual Bridged Local Area
&gt; Networks consisting of LAN media where the transmission delays are fixed
&gt; and symmetrical; for example, IEEE 802.3 full duplex links. This includes
&gt; the maintenance of synchronized time during normal operation and following
&gt; addition, removal, or failure of network components and network
&gt; reconfiguration. It specifies the use of IEEE 1588 specifications where
&gt; applicable in the context of IEEE Stds 802.1D and 802.1Q. Synchronization
&gt; to an externally provided timing signal (e.g., a recognized timing
&gt; standard such as UTC or TAI) is not part of this standard but is not
&gt; precluded."
&gt;
&gt; "This standard enables stations attached to bridged LANs to meet the
&gt; respective jitter, wander, and time synchronization requirements for
&gt; time-sensitive applications."
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think the relevant point for your concern is that "(...UTC...) is not
&gt; part of this standard but is not precluded."
&gt;
&gt; So if a device had capability to keep UTC and was the grandmaster, all
&gt; well and good, but if not, the network timing still works, you just have
&gt; no defined relationship to external time.
&gt;
&gt; Since it seems you would definitely want a device with hardware timing
&gt; support to act as the grandmaster for your network, a standard PC could
&gt; not be the grandmaster, it would have to be a time slave, and might have
&gt; to slave to a device with no concept of UTC.
Still have it wrong.
To play in 1588 you have to have hardware assist. Period.
