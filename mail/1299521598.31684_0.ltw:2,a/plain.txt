Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Compiling Jack in Windows

Hello to all.

I want to compile Jack on Windows XP and after that, experiment with the net
backend. Before all, I downloaded the source files and used MSVC 6.0 and
2008 to compile but I only get "file not found" type errors. Is that a
package or framework that I have to install in order to compile the
application? Any special requeriment? I only compiled that on Linux and it
was simple because there are a lot of references over Internet.

Thanks in advanced
