Before all, I downloaded the source files and used MSVC 6.0 and 2008 to compile but I only get "file not found" type errors. Is that a package or framework that I have to install in order to compile the application? Any special requeriment? I only compiled that on Linux and it was simple because there are a lot of references over Internet.
