&gt; "It gets confusing now that both the PC and the audio

&gt; difficulty is when the PC and the Network both have audio
&gt; interfaces. AVB puts Audio into Ethernet, which is to say that
&gt; there is a virtual audio card at the other end of the Ethernet wire.
&gt; This means that two word clocks need either SRC on their streams,
&gt; or one needs to PLL to the other.

That is just a case of two sound devices, same as two sound cards.  Always
the case that if you have two sound cards, they need to have their
conversion clocks synchronized. That doesn't change whether the transport
is Ethernet, AES3, AES10, whatever.  I think everyone understands that if
you are going to use two devices, then both have to be synchronized.

The point that Torben and I have been making is that clocking requirements
for devices which are bulk data transport only should be different than
devices which convert data to or from analog.  And obviously it can be,
because there are multiple protocols which have specialized hardware on
the audio equipment end, and virtual sound card software on a PC.  Dante
has it, Lightwire.  Even the Ravenna web page talked about a virtual sound
card driver.  I know that Lightwire and Dante don't require special NIC's
in the PC's running the virtual sound card driver. The Ravenna page did
not say, but you seem to be contending that anything participating in AVB
transport of audio is going to need hardware time stamping in the NIC.  I
hope that is not the case.


&gt; Did you know that AVB is mostly specified, at the low level, by IEEE 1722?

No, I did not. I wasn't familiar with that in-progress spec, hence the
confusion.  Thank you for the reference, I've been reading some of the
presentations this afternoon.  Another draft standard which I cannot get
to.  Hopefully will get published soon so I can read the whole thing.

&gt;&gt; Absolute frequency accuracy and jitter are independent

&gt;&gt; are locked to a stratum 1 source such as GPS.

&gt; Phase is the integral of frequency, they are everything but independent.

OK, that totally ignored the point.  Yes, phase is the integral of
frequency.  That doesn't really get to the point that the &gt;long term&lt;
frequency difference of two devices can be made arbitrarily close, but
that may not be what is relevant if the short term jitter affects what you
are trying to do.

What you wrote was:
&gt; &gt; Absolute frequency is not AVB's strength. The local clock
&gt; &gt; on the motherboard, servoed to NTP will be good enough.
&gt; &gt; What application might demand such low jitter RTC?

Jitter is traditionally used to mean integrated phase noise, where
depending on integration time it may even be instantaneous time interval
error.  You can have a large positive error one cycle, a large negative
error the next, and have very high short term jitter because of that, but
the long term average of the frequency can be very accurate.  That was my
point, that the question of what application might demand such an accurate
RTC and what application might demand such a low jitter RTC are two
separate questions and should be understood as such.

&gt; I was actually trying to prevent any soft-only PTP
&gt; or AVB implementation, which seemed to be on the way
&gt; here at Jack.

That I don't get at all.  Why would you want to prevent a software AVB
implementation?

&gt; IEEE 1722 (I apologize for getting the number wrong perviously)
&gt; specifies the PTP that is a subset for AVB. It most definitely
&gt; does not have epoch in it and is not traceable to Greenwich.
&gt; Don't try to use PTP as a replacement for NTP. Even
&gt; IEEE1588 for instruments doesn't require epoch.
&gt;
&gt; Now we're way far afield of Jack.

Actually I don't think we are are, at least not far.  This started out
with a proposal to create an AVB backend for Jack, and understanding the
clocking requirements and what existing kernel timing infrastructure can
be reused and what needs to be created from scratch is very much on topic.

And I think you are saying that it isn't really possible to create a
software only implementation that fulfills the AVB requirements, primarily
due to the 802.1AS synchronization requirements.  In that case then
discussion of the specific requirements is definitely on topic before
someone goes off and spends a few months working on it only to realize
that there really isn't any chance of reliable inter-operation with
compliant AVB equipment.
