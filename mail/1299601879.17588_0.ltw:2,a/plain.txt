That is just a case of two sound devices, same as two sound cards.  Always
the case that if you have two sound cards, they need to have their
conversion clocks synchronized. That doesn't change whether the transport
is Ethernet, AES3, AES10, whatever.  I think everyone understands that if
you are going to use two devices, then both have to be synchronized.

The point that Torben and I have been making is that clocking requirements
for devices which are bulk data transport only should be different than
devices which convert data to or from analog.  And obviously it can be,
because there are multiple protocols which have specialized hardware on
the audio equipment end, and virtual sound card software on a PC.  Dante
has it, Lightwire.  Even the Ravenna web page talked about a virtual sound
card driver.  I know that Lightwire and Dante don't require special NIC's
in the PC's running the virtual sound card driver. The Ravenna page did
not say, but you seem to be contending that anything participating in AVB
transport of audio is going to need hardware time stamping in the NIC.  I
hope that is not the case.

No, I did not. I wasn't familiar with that in-progress spec, hence the
confusion.  Thank you for the reference, I've been reading some of the
presentations this afternoon.  Another draft standard which I cannot get
to.  Hopefully will get published soon so I can read the whole thing.

OK, that totally ignored the point.  Yes, phase is the integral of
frequency.  That doesn't really get to the point that the >long term<
frequency difference of two devices can be made arbitrarily close, but
that may not be what is relevant if the short term jitter affects what you
are trying to do.

Jitter is traditionally used to mean integrated phase noise, where
depending on integration time it may even be instantaneous time interval
error.  You can have a large positive error one cycle, a large negative
error the next, and have very high short term jitter because of that, but
the long term average of the frequency can be very accurate.  That was my
point, that the question of what application might demand such an accurate
RTC and what application might demand such a low jitter RTC are two
separate questions and should be understood as such.

That I don't get at all.  Why would you want to prevent a software AVB
implementation?

Actually I don't think we are are, at least not far.  This started out
with a proposal to create an AVB backend for Jack, and understanding the
clocking requirements and what existing kernel timing infrastructure can
be reused and what needs to be created from scratch is very much on topic.

And I think you are saying that it isn't really possible to create a
software only implementation that fulfills the AVB requirements, primarily
due to the 802.1AS synchronization requirements.  In that case then
discussion of the specific requirements is definitely on topic before
someone goes off and spends a few months working on it only to realize
that there really isn't any chance of reliable inter-operation with
compliant AVB equipment.
