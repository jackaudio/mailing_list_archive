&gt;&gt; difficulty is when the PC and the Network both have audio

&gt;&gt; there is a virtual audio card at the other end of the Ethernet wire.
&gt;&gt; This means that two word clocks need either SRC on their streams,
&gt;&gt; or one needs to PLL to the other.
&gt; That is just a case of two sound devices, same as two sound cards.  Always
&gt; the case that if you have two sound cards, they need to have their
&gt; conversion clocks synchronized. That doesn't change whether the transport
&gt; is Ethernet, AES3, AES10, whatever.  I think everyone understands that if
&gt; you are going to use two devices, then both have to be synchronized.
Good.
&gt; The point that Torben and I have been making is that clocking requirements
&gt; for devices which are bulk data transport only should be different than
&gt; devices which convert data to or from analog.  And obviously it can be,
&gt; because there are multiple protocols which have specialized hardware on
&gt; the audio equipment end, and virtual sound card software on a PC.  Dante
&gt; has it, Lightwire.  Even the Ravenna web page talked about a virtual sound
&gt; card driver.  I know that Lightwire and Dante don't require special NIC's
&gt; in the PC's running the virtual sound card driver. The Ravenna page did
&gt; not say, but you seem to be contending that anything participating in AVB
&gt; transport of audio is going to need hardware time stamping in the NIC.  I
&gt; hope that is not the case.
&gt;
&gt;
Ravenna quote that they use IEEE 1588 under the hood. That requires 
NIC-stamping.
I wouldn't use Dante if I were you.
&gt;&gt; Did you know that AVB is mostly specified, at the low level, by IEEE 1722?
&gt; No, I did not. I wasn't familiar with that in-progress spec, hence the
&gt; confusion.  Thank you for the reference, I've been reading some of the
&gt; presentations this afternoon.  Another draft standard which I cannot get
&gt; to.  Hopefully will get published soon so I can read the whole thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolute frequency accuracy and jitter are independent

&gt;&gt; Phase is the integral of frequency, they are everything but independent.
&gt; OK, that totally ignored the point.  Yes, phase is the integral of
&gt; frequency.  That doesn't really get to the point that the&gt;long term&lt;
&gt; frequency difference of two devices can be made arbitrarily close, but
&gt; that may not be what is relevant if the short term jitter affects what you
&gt; are trying to do.
&gt;
&gt; What you wrote was:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolute frequency is not AVB's strength. The local clock
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the motherboard, servoed to NTP will be good enough.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What application might demand such low jitter RTC?
&gt; Jitter is traditionally used to mean integrated phase noise, where
&gt; depending on integration time it may even be instantaneous time interval
&gt; error.  You can have a large positive error one cycle, a large negative
&gt; error the next, and have very high short term jitter because of that, but
&gt; the long term average of the frequency can be very accurate.  That was my
&gt; point, that the question of what application might demand such an accurate
&gt; RTC and what application might demand such a low jitter RTC are two
&gt; separate questions and should be understood as such.
&gt;
Jitter is all phase noise with spectrum above 10 Hz.
Wander is all phase noise with spectrum below 10 Hz.

cycle-to-cycle jitter is a red herring. The Time Interval Error that 
can't be tracked by any bandwidth+phase-detector of a PLL is what must 
be engineered.
&gt;&gt; I was actually trying to prevent any soft-only PTP
&gt;&gt; or AVB implementation, which seemed to be on the way
&gt;&gt; here at Jack.
&gt; That I don't get at all.  Why would you want to prevent a software AVB
&gt; implementation?
&gt;
Because it will not comply. The BMCA of other compliant NICs might kick 
you out of the pool. You will definitely violate jitter, time inaccuracy 
and total delay requirements of AVB.
&gt;&gt; IEEE 1722 (I apologize for getting the number wrong perviously)
&gt;&gt; specifies the PTP that is a subset for AVB. It most definitely
&gt;&gt; does not have epoch in it and is not traceable to Greenwich.
&gt;&gt; Don't try to use PTP as a replacement for NTP. Even
&gt;&gt; IEEE1588 for instruments doesn't require epoch.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now we're way far afield of Jack.
&gt; Actually I don't think we are are, at least not far.  This started out
&gt; with a proposal to create an AVB backend for Jack, and understanding the
&gt; clocking requirements and what existing kernel timing infrastructure can
&gt; be reused and what needs to be created from scratch is very much on topic.
&gt;
&gt; And I think you are saying that it isn't really possible to create a
&gt; software only implementation that fulfills the AVB requirements, primarily
&gt; due to the 802.1AS synchronization requirements.  In that case then
&gt; discussion of the specific requirements is definitely on topic before
&gt; someone goes off and spends a few months working on it only to realize
&gt; that there really isn't any chance of reliable inter-operation with
&gt; compliant AVB equipment.
&gt;
OK, so we need to find the PTP NIC drivers of the Open world and use 
them for whatever backend we put onto Jack. (Someone had asked whether 
they could use PTP, generally, for a CLOCK_KERNEL, so that was the 
off-topic.)

I would envision a module detection scheme that would not let Jack even 
try to use any NIC that wasn't under control of a PTP module. The scary 
thing is that anyone can make a soft-implementation LOOK LIKE PTP, but 
it would be violating the physics on which the hardware-timestamp 
protocol depends. No lines of code can undo physics faux pas.
