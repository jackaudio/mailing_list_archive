Are you referring to the auto-start option in Qjackctl??? (or something else?)
If you are referring to Qjackctl, i believe that only applies to if
you start Qjackctl, and is not for auto-starting jack on boot.
(someone can correct me, if am wrong. I dont actually use qjackctl)

A)...depending on what Desktop environment you are using, you could
just add jack as a startup application. - i know in gnome this is very
straight forward to do;

system -> preferences -> startup applications

Add a startup application, name it and then put in the commandline
that you wish to use to start jackd. ex:   jackd -r -dalsa -dhw:0
-r44100 -p512 -n2  (or whatever)

...and your done.

B)  I can also tell you how I go about starting Jackd on boot...

In my case , i have multiple dedicated-systems running Jack. ie: a
synth/sampler/looper rackmount, an multi-FX board, etc that i use for
live-performance. ~ I use init-scripts. they first start Jack using
the commandline with my proper settings - ie: what soundcard,
samplerate, frames, etc (as would be found in .jackdrc) and then it
loads each application + assigns the proper audio/midi routing to
each. Then, i tweak the loading order (for faster startup).

...and i am done. It always loads correctly (and is fool proof!)

a guide for something like this would be the "Ubuntu Studio
Preparation" guide. found here:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudioPreparation

scroll to the bottom of the guide, and look for the heading "Get it
all going". It's a simple and straight forward to setup (especially,
if you are new to Jack & if all you want to do is start jackd on
boot!)

hope that helps,

jordan
