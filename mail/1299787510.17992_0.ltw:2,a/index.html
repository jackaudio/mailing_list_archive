&gt; Hi George,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I was looking to start jackd from an init-script in Linux at system start
&gt; &gt; up.  I imagine this is not necessary if I enable auto-start so maybe that
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; the right way to handle things.  I believe a jackdrc (or .jackdrc) is
&gt; &gt; required and setting an environment variable to enable auto start?
&gt;
&gt; Are you referring to the auto-start option in Qjackctl??? (or something
&gt; else?)
&gt; If you are referring to Qjackctl, i believe that only applies to if
&gt; you start Qjackctl, and is not for auto-starting jack on boot.
&gt; (someone can correct me, if am wrong. I dont actually use qjackctl)
&gt;
&gt; A)...depending on what Desktop environment you are using, you could
&gt; just add jack as a startup application. - i know in gnome this is very
&gt; straight forward to do;
&gt;
&gt; system -&gt; preferences -&gt; startup applications
&gt;
&gt; Add a startup application, name it and then put in the commandline
&gt; that you wish to use to start jackd. ex:   jackd -r -dalsa -dhw:0
&gt; -r44100 -p512 -n2  (or whatever)
&gt;
&gt; ...and your done.
&gt;
&gt; B)  I can also tell you how I go about starting Jackd on boot...
&gt;
&gt; In my case , i have multiple dedicated-systems running Jack. ie: a
&gt; synth/sampler/looper rackmount, an multi-FX board, etc that i use for
&gt; live-performance. ~ I use init-scripts. they first start Jack using
&gt; the commandline with my proper settings - ie: what soundcard,
&gt; samplerate, frames, etc (as would be found in .jackdrc) and then it
&gt; loads each application + assigns the proper audio/midi routing to
&gt; each. Then, i tweak the loading order (for faster startup).
&gt;
&gt; ...and i am done. It always loads correctly (and is fool proof!)
&gt;
&gt; a guide for something like this would be the "Ubuntu Studio
&gt; Preparation" guide. found here:
&gt;
&gt; https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudioPreparation
&gt;
&gt; scroll to the bottom of the guide, and look for the heading "Get it
&gt; all going". It's a simple and straight forward to setup (especially,
&gt; if you are new to Jack &amp; if all you want to do is start jackd on
&gt; boot!)
&gt;
&gt; hope that helps,
&gt;

I am doing something similar to what was described in part B) of your answer
and actually have a script similar to the one at the end of the link you
showed.  I did have to put the sleep in there also to get things started
up.  I happened to be running this in a terminal over SSH on a server for
testing purposes.  When exited the shell and expected the terminal to close
it was kept open.  Since I had run several processes that interact with
jackd I killed them one at a time and it wasn't until I killed jackd that
the ssh session closed allowing the terminal window to close.  This is what
led me to believe that jackd had some dependency on a controlling terminal
or something.

This is what I'm referring to with respect to auto-start:
