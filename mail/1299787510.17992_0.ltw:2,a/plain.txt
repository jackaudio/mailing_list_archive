I am doing something similar to what was described in part B) of your answer
and actually have a script similar to the one at the end of the link you
showed.  I did have to put the sleep in there also to get things started
up.  I happened to be running this in a terminal over SSH on a server for
testing purposes.  When exited the shell and expected the terminal to close
it was kept open.  Since I had run several processes that interact with
jackd I killed them one at a time and it wasn't until I killed jackd that
the ssh session closed allowing the terminal window to close.  This is what
led me to believe that jackd had some dependency on a controlling terminal
or something.

This is what I'm referring to with respect to auto-start:
