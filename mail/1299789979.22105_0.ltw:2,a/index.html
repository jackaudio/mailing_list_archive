Hi George,

&gt; I am doing something similar to what was described in part B) of your answer
&gt; and actually have a script similar to the one at the end of the link you
&gt; showed.&#xA0; I did have to put the sleep in there also to get things started
&gt; up.&#xA0; I happened to be running this in a terminal over SSH on a server for
&gt; testing purposes.&#xA0; When exited the shell and expected the terminal to close
&gt; it was kept open.&#xA0; Since I had run several processes that interact with
&gt; jackd I killed them one at a time and it wasn't until I killed jackd that
&gt; the ssh session closed allowing the terminal window to close.&#xA0; This is what
&gt; led me to believe that jackd had some dependency on a controlling terminal
&gt; or something.

If you started jackd from a terminal, killing jackd is necessary to
close the terminal, in that particular use case. ~ i also have done
this before (and recently). on my latest machine the only way to
access the machine is remotely (the Nvidia GPU is toast).

as for using sleep, that is necessary. however, what i do on my one
machine (that can use VGA ouput) is actually have it boot into
fluxbox, and jackd isn't in my script that starts up the apps. Instead
jackd is started before the WM starts, which gives it enough time
before my apps load up (As fluxbox loading gives enough time in
between).

&gt; This is what I'm referring to with respect to auto-start:

&gt; http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/jackdrc%285%29
&gt; http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/jackdrc(5)

Ya, that auto-start specifically says the (jackd) server will start as
"needed", meaning that if you start a jack-client/application, the
server will auto-start, not that it will start on boot... (samething
as in qjackctl).
