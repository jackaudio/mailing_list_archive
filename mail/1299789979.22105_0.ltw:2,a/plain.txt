If you started jackd from a terminal, killing jackd is necessary to
close the terminal, in that particular use case. ~ i also have done
this before (and recently). on my latest machine the only way to
access the machine is remotely (the Nvidia GPU is toast).

as for using sleep, that is necessary. however, what i do on my one
machine (that can use VGA ouput) is actually have it boot into
fluxbox, and jackd isn't in my script that starts up the apps. Instead
jackd is started before the WM starts, which gives it enough time
before my apps load up (As fluxbox loading gives enough time in
between).

Ya, that auto-start specifically says the (jackd) server will start as
"needed", meaning that if you start a jack-client/application, the
server will auto-start, not that it will start on boot... (samething
as in qjackctl).
