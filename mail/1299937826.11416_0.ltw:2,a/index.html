&gt; i actually like that the controlapi is synchronous. this makes it pretty
&gt; easy. and almost all oprations only take a tenth of a second, or even
&gt; less. that ffado takes 3 seconds to start up, seems pretty weird to me,
&gt; and i suspect this is some kind of bug (i dont think that any device can
&gt; be so shitty, that its actually a h/w bug.
&gt;

The first time you use a Terratec Phase88 device with FFADO, it takes 30 
seconds to discover it. In general this is true for BeBoB / AVC based 
discovery of devices. That's just the way it is, it's not a FFADO bug. 
In fact we already work around this by storing the discovery information 
to disk and re-using that for future loads.

What can be labeled a FFADO issue is the fact that starting up FFADO 
even without discovery takes some time as it synchronizes to the 
streams. This is not really necessary. It's probably not going to be 
solved anytime soon as we're heading for ALSA/kernel space anyway thanks 
to Clemens' efforts.

just my 2 cents,

Pieter
