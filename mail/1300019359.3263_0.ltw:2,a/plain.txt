the manual page should be considered the canonical source for this.
its part of the source code. if you're using it on windows, my guess
is that there isn't a trivial way to look at it. here is one of
hundreds of links to one:

http://linux.die.net/man/1/jackd

this may or may not be jack1 or jack2. the parameters should almost
all be the same in both cases.

> Also, how come some of the parameters are used for two different purposes?  For example, "-p" is used to specify the number of ports and also the period size.  "-d" is used to specify the backend driver and also for specifying a duplex hardware device.

arguments that come after "-d BACKEND" are not intepreted by the jack
server but instead are just passed to the backend when it is
instantiated.
