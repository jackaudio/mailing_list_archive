Hi Paul,

thanks for the quick response :]

that's a good hint. i guess i need to get a
usb sniffer to check the data my card is
actually sendig to the host. i configured
it for 16 bits and also tried 24 bits and i
must admit, that higher changes in the
voltage (about 1.4V or so) on my adc
cause the values to somehow mirror, when
it exceeds maximum it should stay there
like clipping, but it goes on from the minimum
at this point. this can really be a bit too much
which is cropped by audacity - i'll try to
figure that out.
