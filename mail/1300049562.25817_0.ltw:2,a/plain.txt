Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Cannot lock down memory (no error)

To whom it may concern,

first of all please excuse me  for asking for support via this email. I searched the web for this problem with jack but i didn't get any solutions for windows. I'm running Jack 1.9.6 on a windows 7 pro system. I'm using jack to root the audio singnals of my digital vinyl system into ableton live. Since one or two months i'm getting this message when I try to start the little .bat script which i supposed to do the job: "Cannot lock down memory (no error)"
I've no idea this message means, and I did not change my windows settings actively....
If you do not feel responable for this, perhaps you can transfer this mail to someone who is concerned.

best regards
Nico Roth
