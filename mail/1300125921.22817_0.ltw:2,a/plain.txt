JACK's ALSA backend does this:

	driver->playback_sample_bytes =
		snd_pcm_format_physical_width (driver->playback_sample_format)
		/ 8;

and then later checks that value to determine how it is going to
convert samples into 32 bit floating point.

it is certainly true that it does not handle 8 bit values, and the
error message could be friendlier. but the value is being reported by
ALSA.
