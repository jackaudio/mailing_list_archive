ooh, seems it would work if i implement the outputs.
i tested this on my built in soundcard and it did produce
the same error unless i leave out -C if i start jack.  So
i hope it will work when my card is capable to support
duplex mode - i'll try to implement that feature now,
but maybe i'm too tired to get it working today. ^^
hmm, i think it should work with -C, shouldn't it?
