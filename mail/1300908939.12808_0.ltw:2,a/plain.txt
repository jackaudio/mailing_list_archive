Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JackServerName parameter to jack_client_open()

Hi!

Sorry, could anyone explain the optional JackServerName parameter of the
jack_client_open() function to me, I'm not quite sure if I fully
understood it. Is there a case where several Jack server instances are
running at the same time?

Could this parameter be "abused" in a Jack server implementation that
provides nesting (i.e., which has "servers" that are themselves clients
to a Jack server one hierarchy level higher)?

Something along the lines of the following:

- no server name is given => connect to the normal server
- "/nestedserver" is given as server name => connect to a "virtual"
server which is itself a client (with name "nestedserver") of the normal
server
- "/nestedserver/evenmorenested" is given => connect to a virtual server
which is itself a client of the virtual server "/nestedserver", and so on...

Cheers,

Arne
