It's not so difficult to write one, did it some years ago just as an
experiment.

This sort of thing would be a lot easier if Jack's code were structured
a bit differently, with the engine being a shared library, exporting 
among others a function 'run_graph()' that runs a cycle on the
complete graph.

Then jackd would be a main program that takes care of e.g. command
line parsing etc, loads the engine library, loads a backend, and
inplements the glue to link them together (this includes creating
the main audio processing thread).

Others application could implement their 'backend' internally,
or, if they are themselves a jack client, call 'run_graph()'
from their process callback.

IIRC I proposed such a thing years ago (the Jack meeting during
the last LAC at ZKM).

Ciao,
