What about an app, lets call it a DAW, that has so many internal connections 
that it is better to use its own jack for all the internal stuff and then only 
communicate with the rest of the world through a limited number of connections 
to the external jack?

One could replace DAW by "modular synth" too. And then you could pull down the 
distinction between "sound(server) protocol" that jack is now and plugin-apis 
like LADSPA, LV2, DSSI, VST and the likes and just call jack the new plugin- 
and soundapp api.

Have fun,

Arnold
