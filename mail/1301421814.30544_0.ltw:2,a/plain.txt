Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Q: What is the difference between Jack 1 and Jack 2

Friends,

I am constantly seeing the question "What is the difference 
between Jack 1 and Jack 2," especially in IRC.  This is 
something that /should/ be in the FAQ[1], but is too broad a 
subject for any one or two authors.  However, we as a 
community need to find a concise answer to this question.

I have started a Wiki page to prototype an answer:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/Q_differenc_jack1_jack2

It's a wiki, which means:  please edit it instead of 
discussing it here.  I'm sure that I got some things wrong, 
mumbled a bit, used confusing jargon, or said something 
that makes you angry.  So... I need your help.

Please keep in mind that we're trying to represent how 
things /are/.  Not how they should be, could be, should have 
been, or whether they're good or bad.  Please stay objective 
and professional.

Full disclosure:  I've briefly talked this over with Paul, 
Stephane, and Torben before posting here.  The hope is that 
this Wiki page will make it into the official JACK FAQ.

Thanks,
Gabriel
