&gt; 
&gt; Friends,
&gt; 
&gt; I am constantly seeing the question "What is the difference between Jack 1 and Jack 2," especially in IRC.  This is something that /should/ be in the FAQ[1], but is too broad a subject for any one or two authors.  However, we as a community need to find a concise answer to this question.
&gt; 
&gt; I have started a Wiki page to prototype an answer:
&gt; 
&gt;   http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/Q_differenc_jack1_jack2
&gt; 
&gt; It's a wiki, which means:  please edit it instead of discussing it here.  I'm sure that I got some things wrong, mumbled a bit, used confusing jargon, or said something that makes you angry.  So... I need your help.
&gt; 
&gt; Please keep in mind that we're trying to represent how things /are/.  Not how they should be, could be, should have been, or whether they're good or bad.  Please stay objective and professional.
&gt; 
&gt; Full disclosure:  I've briefly talked this over with Paul, Stephane, and Torben before posting here.  The hope is that this Wiki page will make it into the official JACK FAQ.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Gabriel


"As a side effect of it's SMP support, it introduces one extra period of latency."

This is clearly wrong as I explained already like a zillion times ((-:.

I corrected that + added some more comments.
