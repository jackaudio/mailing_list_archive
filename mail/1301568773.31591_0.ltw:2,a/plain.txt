Subject:     [Jack-Devel] debugging for jack application developers wiki article?

Hi,

I was looking for some tips on debugging JACK on the wiki but couldn't
find anything.

I know to use the dummy driver.

But while debugging I've been getting broken pipe errors (and
seg-faults when re-starting my app without restarting JACK).

Now I vaguely remember it mentioned, to increase the wait time setting for Jack.

I've done this in QjackCtl  via Wait (usecs) box.

Are there limits for that setting?

I think some notes under on the wiki would be useful.

Cheers,
James.
