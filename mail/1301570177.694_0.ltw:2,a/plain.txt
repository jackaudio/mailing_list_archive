there are no limits.

i debug JACK apps using jackd -r -t 50000 ... -d alsa .....

i generally stop and restart JACK in between runs if the client
crashed or was zombified.

some people (e.g. dave robillard) have reported this not working on
their systems for various reasons. the underlying reason why it
doesn't work is not understood.
