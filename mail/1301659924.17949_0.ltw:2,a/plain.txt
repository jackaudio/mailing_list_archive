Hi Torben and jack-dev community.

I received some bugs report (crash in server with "jackd -d netone"), like:

	• NetOne driver started
	• AutoConfig Override !!!
	• MTU is set to 1400 bytes
	• Cannot read socket fd = 10 err = Interrupted system call
	• [Thread 0xb0862b70 (LWP 6381) exited]
	• NotifyClient fails name = exaile.py event = 18 val1 = 1 val2 = 0
	• netxruns... duration: 11ms
	• jackd: ../common/JackEngine.cpp:932: int Jack::JackEngine::PortConnect(int, jack_port_id_t, jack_port_id_t): Assertion `ref >= 0' failed.


	• jof@studio:~$ jack_netsource -c 120 -n 3 -H 192.168.1.13

The last thing I did (before jack 1.9.7 release) was to synchronize NetJack1 code from JACK1 to JACK2, hoping I did that correctly (basically updating netjack.h,c  and netjack_packet,h,c)

Reviewing the code I see:

 - using  exit(1); in netjack.c instead of properly returning a proper error.

- CELT : celt_mode_create should be matched with celt_mode_destroy. My feeling is that this is not done everywhere it should (especially in JackNetOneDriver.cpp)

This is certainly not the cause of the bugs, but I think this should be fixed (along the "jack_netsource: double free or corruption")n before going anywhere else.

Could you please have a look? 

or if not Torben someone else?

Thanks.

Stéphane
