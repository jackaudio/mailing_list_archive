That sounds like a good idea.

The only calls that I see requiring memory management are:

    jack_midi_blob_create
    jack_midi_blob_free

... which, AFAICS, shouldn't be called in the RT thread and shouldn't
be considered RT safe.

Does that change anything?

I'm probably not aware of all of the implications of shared memory
management here.  Please pardon my naivety.  I would very much
appreciate being enlightened, or a URL to a document that would
enlighten me. :)
