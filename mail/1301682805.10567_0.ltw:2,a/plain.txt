there are two rather significant issues here.

1) why would you structure a program like this when clearly the user
knows where the BOSS GT-10 is connected?
2) is JACK MIDI an appropriate API for this sort of thing?

one can certainly make the argument that a relatively consistent API
for all MIDI I/O is a good thing, and clearly you feel this way having
put the work into this proposed API. but consider how much simpler
this program would be with a simple blocking read/write API for MIDI
when combined with the user knowing there the GT-10 is connected?
