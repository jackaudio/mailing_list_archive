I makes me very happy that you're addressing this.

I still think that it's a fundamental design bug
to assume where the sysex's size is known in advance, and hence
that the blob can and should be created in one go.  Unless you were
planning on making that `size' be a hint and allowing
jack_midi_blob_write to grow the blob?
