It's just a simple example to illustrate the use of the proposed MIDI
blobs.  The example itself isn't all that practical, but I think it
serves its purpose.

A more practical and complex example (one I've been envisioning for
the past few months) would be a MIDI editor for a piece of external
hardware that uses the JACK session API to load and save patches.  I'd
love to open a JACK session, and have my Blofeld automatically load
the patches associated with the session. :)

I think it could be very useful for this sort of thing.

I'm not convinced it would be much simpler.
