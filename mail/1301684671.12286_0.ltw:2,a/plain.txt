No.  The 'jack_midi_blobstream_t' type would allow file-like
operations on blobs.

I don't envision blobs growing dynamically.  A client knows the size
of sysex messages it's going to send, and should be able to deal with
received sysex messages in another thread if memory allocation is
necessary.

The only exception would be MIDI drivers, which have no idea about the
size of sysex messages they might receive.  In this case, I think
command-line arguments should be used to specify the number of blobs
and the size of the blobs that a MIDI driver should create before
starting.
