Okay.

And, I understand that a blob always must hold a whole complete sysex?
Or can we split a sysex over several blobs if we wanted (with a flag
in jack_midi_blobstream_t indicating there's more to come, or "this
blob is the next chunk of a previous incomplete sysex").

If that would be an option, then, it would have the disadvantage
of clients needing to be aware of sysex's in chunks.

Alternatively, given you have a stream API, drivers could still preallocate
a pool of N blob chunks of M size each (roughly, your "number of blobs and the
size of the blobs"), and those blob-chunks could be moved out of the
pool and linked-listed per sysex/blob, and released into the
driver's blob-chunk pool again as readers move past the blob-chunk,
all hidden from the clients.  If clients aren't fast enough advancing
their read streams, so that the driver ends up with no blob chunks left,
clients would get their read streams closed, and their next read would fail.

No doubt more complicated than your proposal...
