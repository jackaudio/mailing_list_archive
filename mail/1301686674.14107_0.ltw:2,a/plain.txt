right *this* is the interesting case. the question is whether the
complexity of your proposal (i'm not actually scoring it, just noting
that its more complex than doing nothing :) is balanced by the
real-world instances of this sort of case. i know i sound biased - i
always argue against things before i support them - but i'd really
like this to work too!
