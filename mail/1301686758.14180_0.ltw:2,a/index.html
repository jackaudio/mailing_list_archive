&gt;&gt; I don't envision blobs growing dynamically. &#xA0;A client knows the size
&gt;&gt; of sysex messages it's going to send, and should be able to deal with
&gt;&gt; received sysex messages in another thread if memory allocation is
&gt;&gt; necessary.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The only exception would be MIDI drivers, which have no idea about the
&gt;&gt; size of sysex messages they might receive. &#xA0;In this case, I think
&gt;&gt; command-line arguments should be used to specify the number of blobs
&gt;&gt; and the size of the blobs that a MIDI driver should create before
&gt;&gt; starting.
&gt;
&gt; Okay.
&gt;
&gt; And, I understand that a blob always must hold a whole complete sysex?
&gt; Or can we split a sysex over several blobs if we wanted (with a flag
&gt; in jack_midi_blobstream_t indicating there's more to come, or "this
&gt; blob is the next chunk of a previous incomplete sysex").

I think continuing to guarantee one complete MIDI event per
'jack_midi_event_t' object is the best way to go.  It's a disadvantage
for MIDI drivers, but it's simpler for most other clients.

&gt; Alternatively, given you have a stream API, drivers could still preallocate
&gt; a pool of N blob chunks of M size each (roughly, your "number of blobs and the
&gt; size of the blobs"), and those blob-chunks could be moved out of the
&gt; pool and linked-listed per sysex/blob, and released into the
&gt; driver's blob-chunk pool again as readers move past the blob-chunk,
&gt; all hidden from the clients. &#xA0;If clients aren't fast enough advancing
&gt; their read streams, so that the driver ends up with no blob chunks left,
&gt; clients would get their read streams closed, and their next read would fail.

This sounds too complex, both in implementation and for clients.
