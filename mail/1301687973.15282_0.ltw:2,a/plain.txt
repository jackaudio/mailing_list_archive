I have a loose idea of the complexity of what I'm proposing, but there
are obviously variables that I haven't assessed and/or don't know
about.  I'd certainly like to have a better idea of how complex it
would be to implement this sort of thing.

Are there ways in which the proposal could be simplified?  I'm open to
ideas.  I'd really like to make this work.

I appreciate you letting me know that. :)
