&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't envision blobs growing dynamically.  A client knows the size
&gt; &gt;&gt; of sysex messages it's going to send, and should be able to deal with
&gt; &gt;&gt; received sysex messages in another thread if memory allocation is
&gt; &gt;&gt; necessary.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The only exception would be MIDI drivers, which have no idea about the
&gt; &gt;&gt; size of sysex messages they might receive.  In this case, I think
&gt; &gt;&gt; command-line arguments should be used to specify the number of blobs
&gt; &gt;&gt; and the size of the blobs that a MIDI driver should create before
&gt; &gt;&gt; starting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And, I understand that a blob always must hold a whole complete sysex?
&gt; &gt; Or can we split a sysex over several blobs if we wanted (with a flag
&gt; &gt; in jack_midi_blobstream_t indicating there's more to come, or "this
&gt; &gt; blob is the next chunk of a previous incomplete sysex").
&gt;
&gt; I think continuing to guarantee one complete MIDI event per
&gt; 'jack_midi_event_t' object is the best way to go.  
This means the event is not delivered to us until it is completely
 received, possibly after several process cycles, right?

I know that the ALSA API breaks long received sysex into chunks and 
 delivers them.
And I get an size error if sending one long sysex with ALSA, I need to
 change our code to chunk them.
IIRC my (older) music keyboard sends chunked sysex.

Thanks.
Tim.

&gt; It's a disadvantage
&gt; for MIDI drivers, but it's simpler for most other clients.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Alternatively, given you have a stream API, drivers could still
&gt; &gt; preallocate a pool of N blob chunks of M size each (roughly, your "number
&gt; &gt; of blobs and the size of the blobs"), and those blob-chunks could be
&gt; &gt; moved out of the pool and linked-listed per sysex/blob, and released into
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; driver's blob-chunk pool again as readers move past the blob-chunk,
&gt; &gt; all hidden from the clients.  If clients aren't fast enough advancing
&gt; &gt; their read streams, so that the driver ends up with no blob chunks left,
&gt; &gt; clients would get their read streams closed, and their next read would
&gt; &gt; fail.
&gt;
&gt; This sounds too complex, both in implementation and for clients.
