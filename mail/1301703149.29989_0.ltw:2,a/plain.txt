Correct.

It's up to the MIDI driver to handle data chunks with whatever API
it's using.  JACK clients shouldn't need to care about blocking, MIDI
baud rate, etc.

Byte data always arrives in chunks of some sort, whether a chunk
represents a complete message, several messages, or one part of a
longer message.  It's up to the MIDI driver to make sure the data is
parsed into complete, valid MIDI messages, and delivers the data to
other clients just like any other JACK client.
