So, we're basically talking about pieces of software for which it's
necessary and/or practical to receive and/or send system exclusive
messages in the context of JACK.

Here are some examples I can think of off the top of my head:

1.) MIDI sequencers
2.) MIDI monitors
3.) Software emulations of MIDI-capable hardware
4.) Applications that route MIDI data to/from MIDI-capable plugins
loaded in the application itself (LV2, VST, DSSI to a lesser extent)

If I think of more examples, I'll post them.
