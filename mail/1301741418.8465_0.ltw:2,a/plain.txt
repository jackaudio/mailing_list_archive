the uint decode error is a celt error.
That generally happens, when celt versions dont match.
(This is basically the case why i didnt bother to support later celt
 versions, adi and me came to the conclusion, that distros should ship 
 celt-0.7 until celts bitstream was frozen)

celt-0.11 is tagged with a "soft freeze" of the bitstream.
So maybe celt-0.12 is going to have a real freeze.

gonna try to fix that. But it only happens when malicious Packets are
sent. (its basically just some sanity checks on the autoconfig values)

In jack1 exiting at that point was sensible.
But with backend switching in place its probably bad.

without a valgrind dump, i dont know, where the corruption happens.
and since celt is seeing a broken bitstream, i suspect its a celt bug.
(that needs to be fixed too, but maybe it already is in later versions)

i need infos which celt versions are used, or a proper valgrind dump.
