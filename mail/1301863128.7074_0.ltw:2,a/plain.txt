Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK 1.9.6 for Windows missing installer

Indeed and it runs beutifuly here !
Of course I had to uninstall 1.9.5 first, as at first try I forgot........and I ended up with two Jacks running at the same time with upredictable attitudes..
After uninstallation of 1.9.5 all went ok. New desktop icons and type again on properties target for 1.9.7 the Asio4All path to get that almost zero latency on my win7 64bit
 system.
Thank you Stephane and all !
Now, I wish we had a 64bit version of Jack on windows.......
Have fun!Panos

The links have been updated for 1.9.7.

The windows installer is included in the package: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jack-1.9.7.tgz
