Stephane I understand.....
and indeed must be few. The other one I know is GrahamG. Also this is why you don't see me much on this list, even if I'm a member for over a year now....
I started using Jack on windows to be possible to add reverb to GrandOrgue at desktop level, since GO has no VSTi version and its release samples are not always enjoyable.Also because it supports Asio and latency is really, at least here, non existent.Then it opened another way for me, as many standalone apps were seeing Jack on audio setup and I started experimenting with very enjoyable results.
There are two cases where Jack helped when nothing else could :Independence and Engine and Piannissimo.These great apps cannot make a sound when I choose Asio on my system due to Microsoft wavetable synthesizer (a great sin and long thread.....) when everything else (and I got many) works ok.
If I start Jack portaudio only, without opening Jack control, and set Engine's audio setup to Jack everything is smooth and nice ! But only the 32bit versions.Not much problem as in my 64bit lap they play ok.Now with the new Independence 3.0 pro (and its big library & Engine 2) I got real problem as the new installer chooses for me the bit resolution and installs without asking (....) the apropriate version = 64bit = no Jack = only VSTi.
I hope I gave you some taste on what's happening in a win7 user of Jack OS.... :-)
Best regardsPanos

I have no real idea of the number of WIndows use for JACK. I have the feeling that it is still very few. So more difficult to get motivated to work on a 64bit version....
