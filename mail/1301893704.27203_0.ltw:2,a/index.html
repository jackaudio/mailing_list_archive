Hi,

With LinuxSampler available in 64-bit Windows builds, and all of the
major 'sampler' applications and DAW application now available in
64-bit builds too, I would imagine that a 64-bit version of Jack for
Windows could become highly regarded as a solution for routing audio
between apps.

I know that in the Virtual Pipe Organ software arena, OS-X users love
Jack for routing through to Reverb apps, as do Linux users. I would
identify a 64-bit Windows build as being a missing piece in the Jack
Audio Connection Kit. Panos and I would certainly be very willing to
help with testing and 'evangelizing' such a build on all the forums
that we are members of.

Kind regards,
GrahamG

&gt; you don't see me much on this list, even if I'm a member for over a year
&gt; now....
&gt; I started using Jack on windows to be possible to add reverb to GrandOrgue
&gt; at desktop level, since GO has no VSTi version and its release samples are
&gt; not always enjoyable.Also because it supports Asio and latency is really, at
&gt; least here, non existent.Then it opened another way for me, as many
&gt; standalone apps were seeing Jack on audio setup and I started experimenting
&gt; with very enjoyable results.
&gt; There are two cases where Jack helped when nothing else could :Independence
&gt; and Engine and Piannissimo.These great apps cannot make a sound when I
&gt; choose Asio on my system due to Microsoft wavetable synthesizer (a great sin
&gt; and long thread.....) when everything else (and I got many) works ok.
&gt; If I start Jack portaudio only, without opening Jack control, and set
&gt; Engine's audio setup to Jack everything is smooth and nice ! But only the
&gt; 32bit versions.Not much problem as in my 64bit lap they play ok.Now with the
&gt; new Independence 3.0 pro (and its big library &amp; Engine 2) I got real problem
&gt; as the new installer chooses for me the bit resolution and installs without
&gt; asking (....) the apropriate version = 64bit = no Jack = only VSTi.
&gt; I hope I gave you some taste on what's happening in a win7 user of Jack
&gt; OS.... :-)
&gt; Best regardsPanos
