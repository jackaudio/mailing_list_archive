Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK 1.9.6 for Windows missing installer

Hi,

With LinuxSampler available in 64-bit Windows builds, and all of the
major 'sampler' applications and DAW application now available in
64-bit builds too, I would imagine that a 64-bit version of Jack for
Windows could become highly regarded as a solution for routing audio
between apps.

I know that in the Virtual Pipe Organ software arena, OS-X users love
Jack for routing through to Reverb apps, as do Linux users. I would
identify a 64-bit Windows build as being a missing piece in the Jack
Audio Connection Kit. Panos and I would certainly be very willing to
help with testing and 'evangelizing' such a build on all the forums
that we are members of.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
