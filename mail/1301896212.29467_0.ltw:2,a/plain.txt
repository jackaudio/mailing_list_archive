Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK 1.9.6 for Windows missing installer

Hi Stephane, Graham and all
Indeed 64bit Jack is missing and would be great if we had.Also, as Graham pointed, the new 20110306 Linuxsampler x64 with 3 engines (gig,sfz & sf2) is a killer machine on windows as I recently tested with different kinds of music and with a VPO for it. To get effects for it on windows I had to use the VSTi x64 option, ie opening host ect
The quality in a hypothetical Jack/LS/SIR2(or any other) combination in 64 bit will be beyond imagination for windows.
Yes I can test whatever it is needed if a path on creating an x64 version will open.As for spreading the word, already, in other forums (Graham was the first) we talk to windows users on how to use Jack (then was 1.9.4....) and what benefits can gain from.
I'm about to post regarding this new 1.9.7 windows installer and where to find it, in case there are other people asking elsewhere about 1.9.6.

Hi,

With LinuxSampler available in 64-bit Windows builds, and all of the
major 'sampler' applications and DAW application now available in
64-bit builds too, I would imagine that a 64-bit version of Jack for
Windows could become highly regarded as a solution for routing audio
between apps.

I know that in the Virtual Pipe Organ software arena, OS-X users love
Jack for routing through to Reverb apps, as do Linux users. I would
identify a 64-bit Windows build as being a missing piece in the Jack
Audio Connection Kit. Panos and I would certainly be very willing to
help with testing and 'evangelizing' such a build on all the forums
that we are members of.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
