&gt;&gt; Indeed and it runs beutifuly here !
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Of course I had to uninstall 1.9.5 first, as at first try I forgot........
&gt;&gt; and I ended up with two Jacks running at the same time with upredictable attitudes..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; After uninstallation of 1.9.5 all went ok. New desktop icons and type again on properties target for 1.9.7 the Asio4All path to get that almost zero latency on my win7 64bit system.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thank you Stephane and all !
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now, I wish we had a 64bit version of Jack on windows.......
&gt; 
&gt; I have no real idea of the number of WIndows use for JACK. I have the feeling that it is still very few. So more difficult to get motivated to work on a 64bit version....
&gt;

Hi St&#xE9;phane, everyone,

Yes, 64bit is pretty much taken as normal on Windows now.  If I had the time,
I'd be looking at what's needed to get JACK up and running in a 32/64bit manner
- that is, so a 32bit app could run through JACK to a 64bit app - as I think
that would be a real killer feature on Windows.  (Sadly my development time is
filled with projects for my wife...)

JACK is still the best tool available to get separate Windows audio apps
talking to one another.  Many Windows users often don't even realise they can
overcome this issue - because it's taken as read "you just don't do that".  I
believe if more Windows users knew about JACK, it would be far more commonly
used and be growing rapidly.

Everyone's work on JACK is much appreciated, especially keeping it going on
Windows!

Thanks!

-- Peter
