please tell me that you've used the basic design of a2jmidid and not
the code that went into the jack1 alsa raw or seq drivers ... please,
please, please ....

i should mention that jack1 contains source for an in-process client
that does what a2jmidid does (minus the dbus-driven stuff) ... it
works but i don't have a clear picture yet of how it should be used.
this client should be usable in both jack1 and jack2 ...
