&gt;&gt; Over the past few weeks, St&#xE9;phane and I have been overhauling the code
&gt;&gt; for the MIDI drivers in JACK 2. &#xA0;This includes the Linux FFADO driver,
&gt;&gt; the Mac CoreMIDI driver, the Windows WinMME driver, and a new Linux
&gt;&gt; 'alsarawmidi' slave driver that can run alongside other master drivers
&gt;&gt; (i.e. FFADO). &#xA0;The new code is now in JACK 2 SVN, and will probably be
&gt;&gt; officially released with JACK 1.9.8.
&gt;
&gt; please tell me that you've used the basic design of a2jmidid and not
&gt; the code that went into the jack1 alsa raw or seq drivers ... please,
&gt; please, please ....

IIRC, the a2jmidid code uses the 'seq' interface.  I used the
'rawmidi' interface.

I did occasionally reference the ALSA raw driver when I was writing
the 'alsarawmidi' driver; however, the code design is somewhat
different, and the driver doesn't have the same problems with scaling
and MIDI jitter that the ALSA raw and seq drivers have (with my
hardware, MIDI jitter would become more and more apparent as more
ports were used), or the problems with very low latencies and jitter
that the ALSA seq driver has.  Of course, I've only tested the driver
on my own hardware so far, which is one of the reasons I sent out this
message in the first place.

&gt; i should mention that jack1 contains source for an in-process client
&gt; that does what a2jmidid does (minus the dbus-driven stuff) ... it
&gt; works but i don't have a clear picture yet of how it should be used.
&gt; this client should be usable in both jack1 and jack2 ...

Are you referring to:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/trunk/jack/drivers/a2j

?  If so, I've looked at it.  IIRC, it handles MIDI input using a
'seq' interface, but doesn't handle MIDI output.  I don't remember if
it interfaces with hardware ports, virtual ports, or both.  The
'alsarawmidi' driver only interfaces with hardware ports.
