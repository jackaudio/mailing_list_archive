IIRC, the a2jmidid code uses the 'seq' interface.  I used the
'rawmidi' interface.

I did occasionally reference the ALSA raw driver when I was writing
the 'alsarawmidi' driver; however, the code design is somewhat
different, and the driver doesn't have the same problems with scaling
and MIDI jitter that the ALSA raw and seq drivers have (with my
hardware, MIDI jitter would become more and more apparent as more
ports were used), or the problems with very low latencies and jitter
that the ALSA seq driver has.  Of course, I've only tested the driver
on my own hardware so far, which is one of the reasons I sent out this
message in the first place.

Are you referring to:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/trunk/jack/drivers/a2j

?  If so, I've looked at it.  IIRC, it handles MIDI input using a
'seq' interface, but doesn't handle MIDI output.  I don't remember if
it interfaces with hardware ports, virtual ports, or both.  The
'alsarawmidi' driver only interfaces with hardware ports.
