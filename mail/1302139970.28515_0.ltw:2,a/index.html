&gt; I did occasionally reference the ALSA raw driver when I was writing

&gt; hardware, MIDI jitter would become more and more apparent as more
&gt; ports were used), or the problems with very low latencies and jitter
&gt; that the ALSA seq driver has. &#xA0;Of course, I've only tested the driver
&gt; on my own hardware so far, which is one of the reasons I sent out this
&gt; message in the first place.

the key thing is to have your own thread that does the i/o. and maybe
uses poll(2). most importantly is timestamping, which it sounds if you
are doing if you're handling jitter.

&gt; Are you referring to:
&gt;
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/trunk/jack/drivers/a2j

yes.

&gt; ? &#xA0;If so, I've looked at it. &#xA0;IIRC, it handles MIDI input using a
&gt; 'seq' interface, but doesn't handle MIDI output. &#xA0;I don't remember if
&gt; it interfaces with hardware ports, virtual ports, or both. &#xA0;The
&gt; 'alsarawmidi' driver only interfaces with hardware ports.

it interfaces with both h/w and virtual ports, but yes, via the seq
API. and yeah, right now, its input only but thats a detail because
the code is there to do both.
