the key thing is to have your own thread that does the i/o. and maybe
uses poll(2). most importantly is timestamping, which it sounds if you
are doing if you're handling jitter.

yes.

it interfaces with both h/w and virtual ports, but yes, via the seq
API. and yeah, right now, its input only but thats a detail because
the code is there to do both.
