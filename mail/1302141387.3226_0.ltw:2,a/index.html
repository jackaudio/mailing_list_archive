&gt;&gt; I did occasionally reference the ALSA raw driver when I was writing
&gt;&gt; the 'alsarawmidi' driver; however, the code design is somewhat
&gt;&gt; different, and the driver doesn't have the same problems with scaling
&gt;&gt; and MIDI jitter that the ALSA raw and seq drivers have (with my
&gt;&gt; hardware, MIDI jitter would become more and more apparent as more
&gt;&gt; ports were used), or the problems with very low latencies and jitter
&gt;&gt; that the ALSA seq driver has. &#xA0;Of course, I've only tested the driver
&gt;&gt; on my own hardware so far, which is one of the reasons I sent out this
&gt;&gt; message in the first place.
&gt;
&gt; the key thing is to have your own thread that does the i/o. and maybe
&gt; uses poll(2). most importantly is timestamping, which it sounds if you
&gt; are doing if you're handling jitter.

This is exactly what's happening.  I'm using 'ppoll' to handle polling.

When I first did research for writing this driver, I was looking
through the ALSA kernel code, and noticed that the default behavior
for the 'drain' method (when a driver doesn't set its own rawmidi
'drain' method) is to sleep for 50 milliseconds, and then return,
regardless of whether blocking I/O is used or not.  So, one of the
things I did with the 'alsarawmidi' driver is to call:

    snd_rawmidi_params_set_avail_min(rawmidi, params, 1);

... to make the driver wake up when any bytes are written to a port,
and to avoid calling `snd_rawmidi_drain` completely.

That might be a quick way to improve the 'raw' driver.  IDK.
