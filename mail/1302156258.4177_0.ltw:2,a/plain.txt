Subject:     [Jack-Devel] newbie questions about Jack for Windows

Hi all, a few questions I hope are easy.  Running W764.

1.  Can anyone confirm Jack for Windows will actually do 96000 sample rate not 
just 44100?

2.  If #1 is Yes... in Jack Control ("Audio Connection Kit"), I can go to setup 
and 96000 is selected, but I cannot figure out how to make it become the active 
sample rate since the fake display shows "Active RT 44100 Hz" - I am unable to 
get it to "Active RT 96000 Hz" no matter what I try.   What do I do?

3.  On Windows, what is the story with Jack as it relates to ASIO.  I am 
confused if Jack Router is to be considered an ASIO device or not.

Thank you

PS.  The context here is I am ultimately trying to get Ableton Live to play out 
at 96000 into Samplitude for mixing, EQ, etc.. then output to my RME Multiface 
audio interface.
