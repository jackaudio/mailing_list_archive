Okay.

I made a bad assumption.  In my defense, the ALSA API documentation is
a bit lacking in details. :)

Right.  The JACK ALSA raw driver calls 'snd_rawmidi_drain' after each
successful call to 'snd_rawmidi_write'.  Since one thread is handling
output to all ports, couldn't that cause some ports to be neglected?
