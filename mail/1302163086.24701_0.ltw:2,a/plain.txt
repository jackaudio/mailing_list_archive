Devin did an amazing job in restructuring the whole code, defining some reusable concepts so that each driver on each platform will hopefully be easier to optimize, debug and maintain.

The point here is that with the JACK2 master/slave model for drivers, the MIDI driver can be used with different masters : audio, dummy, or net.
This add a lot of flexibility to the system.

Testing on OSX and Windows will be a bit more complex since building JACK2 on OSX (Xcode) or Windows (CodeBlock) still require a bit of blood and sweat...

We plan to release JackOSX 0.88 package soon (based on Jack 1.9.7 so old model for CoreMidi driver..) An experimental JackOSX 0.89 package based on 1.9.8 SVN can be done later.

I'm currently working on 64/32 support on WIndows...(will need some time to test and prepare an installer)
