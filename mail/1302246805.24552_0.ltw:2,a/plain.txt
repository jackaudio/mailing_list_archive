Subject:     [Jack-Devel] troubles getting m-audio transit usb working

Hello

I have a working m-audio transit usb with pulse audio. Trying to run
the soundcard with jack. I tried nearly every combination in the frontend
for configuration. Whatever I do the following messages are displayed:

jackd 0.120.2

Copyright 2001-2009 Paul
Davis, Stephane Letz, Jack O'Quinn, Torben Hohn and others.

jackd comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY

no message buffer overruns

JACK compiled with System
V SHM support.

loading driver ..

apparent rate = 48000

creating alsa driver ...
hw:0|hw:0|1024|3|48000|0|0|nomon|swmeter|-|16bit

control device hw:0

configuring for 48000Hz,
period = 1024 frames (21.3 ms), buffer = 3 periods

ALSA: final selected
sample format for capture: 16bit little-endian

ALSA: use 3 periods for

**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 0.011 msecs

**** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 0.007 msecs

.... repeats very fast a lot of time



I'm using Ubuntu Studio. I had the m-audio transit working on other machine with jack running. Using 
the same jack configuration did not work on the current machine.

Any help is much appreciated.

Best regards
Herbie
