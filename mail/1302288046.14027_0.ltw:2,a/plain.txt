There's a problem with JACK MIDI port name uniqueness in the
'alsarawmidi' driver.  I've committed a fix to the GIT repo, but it
isn't available in JACK 2 SVN yet.

When I run JACK 2 with the fix, I see 4 virtual raw MIDI devices, each
with 16 input ports and 16 output ports.  It appears that the increase
in the port count produces more jitter in the driver, I assume because
of the polling of 128 file descriptors, but I'm not totally sure.

I wonder if using the 'epoll' interface instead of 'ppoll' would be faster.
