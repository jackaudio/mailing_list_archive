Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK2 branching

After a discussion with Stephane and Devin, I've created a wiki page [1]
that aims to describe the jack2 branching, in SVN and GIT. The page is
still in draft state but I'd like to announce its existence and raise
some related questions.

ATM only the svn trunk - git master branch relation is strictly
maintained. This is mainly because I'm not entirely sure what we should
do with the other jack2 svn branches. I think that the libjacknet and
pipelining SVN branches are active ones because Stephane rebases them
From time to time. Maybe there are other. Do you think it it a good idea
to switch to git only workflow for them? Do we really have to maintain
svn (non-trunk) branches when we can maintain them as other git only
branches?

What are the git only workflows involved? IIRC, so far we had three
cases of git branch use.

 * my ladi-related branches. They are not really used for collaboration
   but for maintenance of jack2 codebase modifications. I.e. they are
   long living branches.
 * The netjack1 and jack-session branches (Torben)
 * The new MIDI branches (Devin/Stephane)

Is there are need to define the practices used for collaboration between
developers in git branch? This is a pure git workflow and as such there
are less restrictions than when git-svn is involved. I think that we
should favour rebases when for commits that are not yet pushed and
merges for already pushed commits. Still, I've not actively participated
in pure GIT branch collaboration and thus it makes more sense to
document what the current practices are, especially the good ones. If we
manage to define some good GIT workflow, maybe we will face less GIT
mess in future. And yes, with GIT we can (and did) generate lot of mess
because it is powerful and with few inherent restrictions.

Should we delete already merged branches? Should we have a history log
of branching/merging?

If you have comments about the current content of the wiki page, I'm
open for them. If you like to act bold, feel free to correct and improve
that page, but please describe the reality, not the desired future,
especially if you know that it is controversial.
