That was incredibly helpful!  I was able to get 4 channels of 96khz audio routed 
from Ableton Live into Samplitude and to my sound system with no pops or 
glitches.    Thank you!

Next question:  I can only seem to get 4 channels of audio... I actually want 
6.  Is there a hidden setting to create additional channels for Jack?  Ableton 
Live only "sees" 4 channels of Jack audio, same with Samplitude.  How do I make 
Jack audio a 6 channel router?

Thank you

Hi Jay,

I have found that the best way to initiate Jack for Windows is to
modify the properties of the Jack PortAudio shortcut to match what
sample rate and device I want to use.

For example, right click on the Jack PortAudio icon in the Start menu,
select 'Properties', then in the 'Target' text box modify the command
to something like:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.7\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d
"ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2" -r 96000

JackRouter is a virtual ASIO device that routes the ASIO audio from
the application into the Jack audio server. You can then route that
audio signal in the Connections panel of the Jack Control application.

So, start Jack using the method described above (obviously change the
ASIO4ALL driver to your RME one and make sure that the Jack server is
running) and then in Ableton Live select Jack Router in your ASIO
driver selection. In the Connections panel you should then see the
audio in and be able to route it to your system out.

Hope that helps! Ask some more if you're still having issues.
