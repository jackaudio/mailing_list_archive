Yes. 

- "libjacknet" is a branch with some cleanup and CELT support for NetJack2, as well as a exposed API (the net.h file in public headers) to access NetJack protocol without having to run a Jack server. I did that for some experiments with iPhone for instance.  But since there is still this NetJack1/NetJack2, I don't know what do to with this development on the long term...

- "pipelining" is the stuff allowing to better use mutiprocessor machines with pure sequential part in the jack graph?

No AFIACS.

It would certainly help. How difficult would it be. I we decide to do that, I guess I should rebase form SVN trunk before right?

Probably not.

Not sure of their "liveness" state... Torben ?

Already merged on SVN trunk for the most part, but sill used By Devin for improvements.

I guess yes for unused one like: 

devin-resolving
devin-merge-20110405
newer-midi-with-winmme-driver (merge in newer-midi that continue its own life)
newer-midi-with-coremidi-driver  (merge in newer-midi that continue its own life)
server-ctl-proposal (already merged)
new-midi ==> replaced by newer-midi

mob ??
js-rebase ??
jack-session ?? (Torben ??)

What is the git command to delete a remote branch?

Would help yes.

Did some additions.
