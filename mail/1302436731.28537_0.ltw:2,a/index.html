&gt;&gt; Do you think it it a good idea to switch to git only workflow for
&gt;&gt; them?
&gt;
&gt; It would certainly help. How difficult would it be. I we decide to do
&gt; that, I guess I should rebase form SVN trunk before right?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do we really have to maintain svn (non-trunk) branches when we can
&gt;&gt; maintain them as other git only branches?
&gt;
&gt; Probably not.

It was easy:

git branch libjacknet refs/remotes/libjacknet
git branch pipelining refs/remotes/pipelining
git push cz libjacknet pipelining

To get new stuff from the svn trunk, one would first update the master
branch to have latest svn trunk, then one would do a regular git merge:

git stash # ensure there are no uncommited changes
git checkout master
git svn fetch
git rebase trunk
git checkout pipelining
git merge master -m "merge svn trunk rNNNN"
git push trunk master pipelining

&gt;&gt;  Is there are need to define the practices used for collaboration
&gt;&gt; between developers in git branch? This is a pure git workflow and as
&gt;&gt; such there are less restrictions than when git-svn is involved. I
&gt;&gt; think that we should favour rebases when for commits that are not
&gt;&gt; yet pushed and merges for already pushed commits. Still, I've not
&gt;&gt; actively participated in pure GIT branch collaboration and thus it
&gt;&gt; makes more sense to document what the current practices are,
&gt;&gt; especially the good ones. If we manage to define some good GIT
&gt;&gt; workflow, maybe we will face less GIT mess in future. And yes, with
&gt;&gt; GIT we can (and did) generate lot of mess because it is powerful and
&gt;&gt; with few inherent restrictions.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Should we delete already merged branches?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I guess yes for unused one like:
&gt;
&gt; devin-resolving devin-merge-20110405 newer-midi-with-winmme-driver
&gt; (merge in newer-midi that continue its own life)
&gt; newer-midi-with-coremidi-driver (merge in newer-midi that continue its
&gt; own life) server-ctl-proposal (already merged) new-midi ==&gt; replaced
&gt; by newer-midi
&gt;
&gt; mob ??  js-rebase ??  jack-session ?? (Torben ??)

we should not delete "mob". it is special feature of repo.or.cz that
allows annonymous users to push commits to that branch.

&gt; What is the git command to delete a remote branch?

git push cz :devin-resolving

(notice the ':' before the branch name)

&gt;&gt; Should we have a history log of branching/merging?
&gt;
&gt; Would help yes.

In the Changelog spirit, I created one on the wiki:
