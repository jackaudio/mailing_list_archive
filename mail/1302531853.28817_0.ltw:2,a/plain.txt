As far as I know, nothing is said in jack/session.h or elsewhere about how the session manager will tokenize that command line when restoring the saved session. Right now it seems that qjackctl is just splitting the command-line at each whitespace, which does not work as expected if ${SESSION_DIR} contains whitespaces.

it is a session participating client's responsability to stuff its own 
command line, specifically about where "${SESSION_DIR}" gets into 
it--maybe it's not quoting it properly--it is not qjackctl's and maybe 
not any other session manager for that matter.
