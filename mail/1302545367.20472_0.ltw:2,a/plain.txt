As far as I know, nothing is said in jack/session.h or elsewhere about how the session manager will tokenize that command line when restoring the saved session. Right now it seems that qjackctl is just splitting the command-line at each whitespace, which does not work as expected if ${SESSION_DIR} contains whitespaces.

Agreed, but the session manager is still tokenizing the command line into an array of strings before calling exec(), if it is just splitting the command line with respect to each whitespace, what should the session client put in that command line if it has a whitespace in its own name (or in its path) ? 

A simple rule stating that in the command-line argument separation is performed with respect to whitespaces except for those that are escaped by a backslash would help to prevent these issues, I think.
