Subject:     [Jack-Devel] System wide instance

I use radio automation software that plays and captures audio with a daemon
running as a system user. The daemon can do this as a jack client but this
raises the issue of who then  runs jackd if a human user wants to patch things
in. Running the playout daemon as a normal user is not an option as users
should not be allowed to touch the audio library.

I've tried running jackd as a system user with PROMISCUOUS_SERVER
and clients seem to be able to connect but I don't see any clients in the
qjackctl patchbay.

So is there a good way of going about this?
Is there any documentation for a multi-user setup?

I maintain packages for this software so I am trying to find an elegant 
solution that can be realized in initscripts.
