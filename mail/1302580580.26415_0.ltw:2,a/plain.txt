Excellent. :)

Probably not.

How long the test takes is proportional to the number of messages you
send, the MIDI out port latency, and the MIDI in port latency.

A test with these parameters will take more than a couple minutes.
The program will tell you if a message takes more than 5 seconds to
send and receive (the -t switch).

If you want to speed up the test, start JACK with a smaller period
size (1024, 512, 256, etc.), or send out less messages (-s 8192 means
you're testing with 8192 MIDI messages).
