Subject:     [Jack-Devel] I need help with compiling Jack support for Fluidsynth using VS 2008

Hi Guys,

I'm hoping that someone more familiar with VS 2008 can help me. I have
used CMake to create a VS 2008 project for Fludisynth, and used the
Windows build of Jack 1.9.7 for Include and Libs. The project is
created successfully, I'm able to open it in VS 2008, but when I
attempt a build I get the following linking errors:

Linking...

fluidsynth-r417\build\src\Release\BuildLog.htm"
libfluidsynth - 8 error(s), 0 warning(s)
========== Rebuild All: 1 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 skipped ==========

So somewhere I'm missing a reference or lib or dll...

I'm not a programmer, just a hobbyist (Technical Writer by trade), so
if anyone has some pointers that would help locate or fix the problem
please let me know.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
