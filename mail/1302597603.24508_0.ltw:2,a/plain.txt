Ok, that's because you are using QProcess::startDetached() which interprets double quotes. So, assuming that nobody will ever want to use a double quote char inside its session_dir path or in the application name, I can protect my arguments with that. It looks like pyjacksm uses subprocess.Popen(..., shell=True) to start the clients, so double quotes will work as well (but other characters such as $ () etc will also be interpreted by the shell).
