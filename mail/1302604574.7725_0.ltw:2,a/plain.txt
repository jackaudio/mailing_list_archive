Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Numerous Xcode targets for Jack2

Hi everyone,

Iíd like to build Jack2 on Mac OS X.  According to the README, the appropriate method is to use Xcode to do so.  While building with the latest release (1.9.7) is quite broken, the latest revision (r4293) seems much better and, apart from the assumption that some libraries and headers are installed in /opt/local (I donít use macports), it should build fine.

However, I also want to be able to switch quickly from one architecture to another; and the targets are designed in such a way that it is not that easy:

óevery target is duplicated (once for ppc [32 bits]+ i386 , once for i386 + x86_64)
ómany information, such as target platform, seems to be set within each target (i.e. about 90 times) instead of inherited from a single config file;
e.g., switching the architecture to intel 32 bits only would require about 45 changes

Plus, while not really troublesome, some other things are quite inelegant:
ótools are linked with frameworks through "other linked flags" instead of using linked libraries
óthe Default configuration is not always consistent with the Development and Deployment configurations
e.g., For audioadapter Universal, Development and Deployment configs are set to Intel 32 bits only, but Default is i386 + ppc.
óthe target for jackdmp is called jackdmp framework (?)

So I was wondering, are there some reasons why the targets are that complex or should I not worry, butcher my way through and simplify as much as possible?

Cheers,

…douard GILBERT
