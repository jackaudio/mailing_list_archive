While building with the latest release (1.9.7) is quite broken, the latest revision (r4293) seems much better and, apart from the assumption that some libraries and headers are installed in /opt/local (I don’t use macports), it should build fine.

History... incremental changes on an initial PPC only version, too lazy to improve.

Nothing against cleanup, better version welcome.
