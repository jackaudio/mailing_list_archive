Dear Experts,

I am new to the Linux and JACK world.

I know I should have gone through the mail archives before posting this message, but due to the urgency of the project I am going to post a few queries. Please link me to the archives if required.

We are evaluating two of the popular audio servers for a project namely JACK and PulseAudio.

I would like to know what are their advantages and disadvantages over each other. I did go through this (http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/when-pa-and-when-not.html) but I would like to know if there are any more glaring differences.

Also from functionality perspective please let me know if the following features are supported by JACK:

1.       Is there a source and sink concept like in PA or GStreamer? If so can any source connect to any compatible sink?
2.       Does JACK have an inbuilt Sample Rate Converter? Say for example data is flowing from one JACK client to another each with different Sample Rate, will the SR conversion be taken care of by JACK?
3.       Are there separate channels for data and command flow? Data can be audio stream and command could be something like play, pause etc.
4.       Does it support block processing?
5.       When I set a particular volume, bass, treble etc settings and then when I restart does JACK load the previous settings?
6.       Does JACK come with some diagnosis tools? DEBUG, ERROR messages etc?

Finally to get a start on JACK where should I start?

Apologies if these have been answered before, but due to shortage of time, I haven't been able to go through the archives.

Thanks in advance.

-Best Regards
Vallabha
