You're looking for http://jackaudio.org/documentation

Just to get this right: PulseAudio is consumer grade (think of playback)
while JACK is more on the producer side. Some may find this
oversimplifying, but usually you don't want non-audio experts to run
jackd. It's mainly for studios, broadcasting and live setups.

Yes (to both questions)

There are no different sample rates, all jack clients run at the same
samplerate.

Basically, there's only data flow and no commands. You can, to some
degree, emit play/pause commands, but they don't necessarily affect all
clients, only those who have a notion of time/bars like Logic or Cubase.

Block processing? You'll get a callback for each N samples, were N is a
power of two. If this is a block, then yes, it does block processing.

Jack has no notion of volumes, bass, treble or whatsoever. Jack just
routes audio from sinks to sources. It has session support, so if the
sink knows how to handle this session data and restores all the
settings, then it would be persisent. Note that this doesn't hold true
for the ALSA "sinks" at the moment, and I guess it never will.

Sort of. There's verbose mode, telling you if something's wrong.

The documentation link I've posted above. And see the example-clients
directory.
