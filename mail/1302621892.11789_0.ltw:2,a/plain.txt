Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installer for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4294) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Good advice, and I took it :)

It installed ok, then I registered the 64-bit dll with regsvr32
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\JackRouter64.dll", and then ran
the PortAudio driver as per the installed shortcut, and this is the
failed result:

---------------------

Do I need to remove or rename something in order to be using the
correct PortAudio dll (I see there are two)?

Kind regards,
