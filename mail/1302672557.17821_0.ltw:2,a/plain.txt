Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installer for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4294) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Hi Stéphane,

Thank you for the new download, this one has successfully started the
Jack Server, and I now have it running on the ASIO4ALL v2 driver.

I have successfully connected a 32-bit ASIO application to JackRouter
(fluidsynth with PortAudio ASIO), BUT I did not get sound straight
away... I had to load Jack Control, enter the Connection window, and
connect the L and R outputs to the 3rd and 4th System connections.
Previous versions of Jack have only shown 2 audio outputs, this one
shows playback_1 through playback_4 (with 3 and 4 being my speakers).

I have also successfully connected a 64-bit ASIO application
(Hauptwerk 64-bit ASIO), and again I did not get sound straight away
but had to connect Output1 and Output2 to playback_3 and playback_4 in
the Jack Control Connections window.

So, congratulations Stéphane!! The 32/64 bridge is working well here.
I will do some more testing as the day progresses. If you need the
console output again to determine speaker locations, etc, just let me
know.

Kind regards (and many thanks!)
