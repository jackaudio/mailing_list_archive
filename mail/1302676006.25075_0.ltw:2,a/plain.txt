Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installer for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4294) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Hi Stéphane,

Running 32/64-bit Jack, jack_lsp -A:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8>jack_lsp -A
Cannot lock down memory area (No error)
system:capture_1
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:out1
system:capture_2
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:out2
system:playback_1
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in1
system:playback_2
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in2
system:playback_3
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in3
system:playback_4
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in4
Cannot unlock down memory area (No error)

Running 32-bit Jack install:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8_32>jack_lsp -A
Cannot lock down memory area (No error)
system:capture_1
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:out1
system:capture_2
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:out2
system:playback_1
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in1
system:playback_2
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in2
system:playback_3
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in3
system:playback_4
   portaudio:ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2:in4
Cannot unlock down memory area (No error)

I got the same behavior in 32-bit as in 64-bit, so I then loaded the
advanced config panel for ASIO4ALL and disabled the 'Line in'
connections. Reran Jack, and now I only have two outputs in the system
and everything connects to the speakers by default.

This is a newer version of ASIO4ALL than I have been using in the
past, so I will now also test with Jack 1.9.7 and let you know what
results I get there.

Bottom line = 32-bit and 64-bit report the same devices, so nothing
wrong with Jack for Windows

Thanks,
GrahamG
