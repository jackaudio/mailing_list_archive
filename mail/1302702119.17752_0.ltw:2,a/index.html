Hi Graham, Stephane and all
Yesterday I installed the 32bit version in my 32bit lap (AMD Athlon dual 2.3GHz 2GBram win7 home premium IDT soundcard)
Installation good.Problem.All applications failed to see Jack exept Kontakt 4.2.2 full and Reaktor 5 player.
I mean, Hauptwerk, GrandOrgue, SampleTank ect and many savihosted VSTs, some had the jackrouter option on device and if selected they said cannot load or start Asio driver and others nothing at all like Jack wasn't there....
With Kontakt 4.2.2 full I selected Jack driver (!?) and then Jackrouter, then I made the connections manually, Kontakt - system and got sound. Connection system to system was not done automaticly when I oppened control (like in 1.9.7, 1.9.5, 1.9.4).
Then I opened Reaktor and here I did the same (jack driver showing and running) but Reaktor appeared in the oposite to Kontakt, I mean in Jack control there were : Kontakt and system on the left and Reaktor and system on the right.....
In a different order of opening clients, ie Open first Reaktor and then Kontakt, bothe clients appeared on the left with system and system alone on the right. I played with both clients on desktop very well. Sound in very HQ.
These were not happening with my 1.9.7 Jack (all perfect).
There must be something wrong I did, possibly, In setup I saw Alsa driver, then I repeat the same as above with Portaudio driver selected. The same results.Why is this happening?
I hadn't the chance to test my most wanted 64 bit as my main lap(x64) was not available :-(I'll try this eveningAnd post what is showing in Jackportaudio when open first.
regardsPanos

Hi St&#xE9;phane,

I'm downloading the 32-bit installer now. I'll post once it is
downloaded, installed, and run.

It might also be something that ASIO4ALL is doing (supplying Line Out
before Speaker Out). I will also experiment with those settings.


Kind regards,
GrahamG

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi St&#xE9;phane,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the new download, this one has successfully started the
&gt;&gt; Jack Server, and I now have it running on the ASIO4ALL v2 driver.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have successfully connected a 32-bit ASIO application to JackRouter
&gt;&gt; (fluidsynth with PortAudio ASIO), BUT I did not get sound straight
&gt;&gt; away... I had to load Jack Control, enter the Connection window, and
&gt;&gt; connect the L and R outputs to the 3rd and 4th System connections.
&gt;&gt; Previous versions of Jack have only shown 2 audio outputs, this one
&gt;&gt; shows playback_1 through playback_4 (with 3 and 4 being my speakers).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also successfully connected a 64-bit ASIO application
&gt;&gt; (Hauptwerk 64-bit ASIO), and again I did not get sound straight away
&gt;&gt; but had to connect Output1 and Output2 to playback_3 and playback_4 in
&gt;&gt; the Jack Control Connections window.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, congratulations St&#xE9;phane!! The 32/64 bridge is working well here.
&gt;&gt; I will do some more testing as the day progresses. If you need the
&gt;&gt; console output again to determine speaker locations, etc, just let me
&gt;&gt; know.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Kind regards (and many thanks!)
&gt;&gt; GrahamG
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; OK good to know that it works.
&gt;
&gt; The only change concerning audio is that I recompiled the latest portaudio
&gt; version in 64 bits, so the way it access the underlying audio may have
&gt; changed. One way to see that would be to install also the 1.9.8 package in
&gt; 32 bits mode (that still use the old portaudio dll) and see if audio
&gt; channles are accessed differently. Can you possibly do that?, that is:
&gt;
&gt; "jackd -v -d portaudio -l" in a terminal for 64 and 32 bits versions.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; St&#xE9;phane
