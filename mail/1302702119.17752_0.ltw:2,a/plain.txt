Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installer for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4294) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Hi Graham, Stephane and all
Yesterday I installed the 32bit version in my 32bit lap (AMD Athlon dual 2.3GHz 2GBram win7 home premium IDT soundcard)
Installation good.Problem.All applications failed to see Jack exept Kontakt 4.2.2 full and Reaktor 5 player.
I mean, Hauptwerk, GrandOrgue, SampleTank ect and many savihosted VSTs, some had the jackrouter option on device and if selected they said cannot load or start Asio driver and others nothing at all like Jack wasn't there....
With Kontakt 4.2.2 full I selected Jack driver (!?) and then Jackrouter, then I made the connections manually, Kontakt - system and got sound. Connection system to system was not done automaticly when I oppened control (like in 1.9.7, 1.9.5, 1.9.4).
Then I opened Reaktor and here I did the same (jack driver showing and running) but Reaktor appeared in the oposite to Kontakt, I mean in Jack control there were : Kontakt and system on the left and Reaktor and system on the right.....
In a different order of opening clients, ie Open first Reaktor and then Kontakt, bothe clients appeared on the left with system and system alone on the right. I played with both clients on desktop very well. Sound in very HQ.
These were not happening with my 1.9.7 Jack (all perfect).
There must be something wrong I did, possibly, In setup I saw Alsa driver, then I repeat the same as above with Portaudio driver selected. The same results.Why is this happening?
I hadn't the chance to test my most wanted 64 bit as my main lap(x64) was not available :-(I'll try this eveningAnd post what is showing in Jackportaudio when open first.
regardsPanos

Hi Stéphane,

I'm downloading the 32-bit installer now. I'll post once it is
downloaded, installed, and run.

It might also be something that ASIO4ALL is doing (supplying Line Out
before Speaker Out). I will also experiment with those settings.


Kind regards,
GrahamG
