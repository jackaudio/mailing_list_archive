&gt; 
&gt; Hi Graham, Stephane and all
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I installed the 32bit version in my 32bit lap (AMD Athlon dual 2.3GHz 2GBram win7 home premium IDT soundcard)
&gt; 
&gt; Installation good.
&gt; Problem.
&gt; All applications failed to see Jack exept Kontakt 4.2.2 full and Reaktor 5 player.
&gt; 
&gt; I mean, Hauptwerk, GrandOrgue, SampleTank ect and many savihosted VSTs, some had the jackrouter option on device and if selected they said cannot load or start Asio driver and others nothing at all like Jack wasn't there....

I uploaded a new version based on SVN 4299. Microsoft redistribuable 2010 VC++ was missing. Please try it.


&gt; 
&gt; With Kontakt 4.2.2 full I selected Jack driver (!?) and then Jackrouter, then I made the connections manually, Kontakt - system and got sound. Connection system to system was not done automaticly when I oppened control (like in 1.9.7, 1.9.5, 1.9.4).

Tested here on XP.... works as before.

&gt; 
&gt; Then I opened Reaktor and here I did the same (jack driver showing and running) but Reaktor appeared in the oposite to Kontakt, I mean in Jack control there were : Kontakt and system on the left and Reaktor and system on the right.....
&gt; 
&gt; In a different order of opening clients, ie Open first Reaktor and then Kontakt, bothe clients appeared on the left with system and system alone on the right. I played with both clients on desktop very well. Sound in very HQ.
&gt; 
&gt; These were not happening with my 1.9.7 Jack (all perfect).
&gt; 
&gt; There must be something wrong I did, possibly, In setup I saw Alsa driver, then I repeat the same as above with Portaudio driver selected. The same results.
&gt; Why is this happening?

"portaudio" has to be selected of course, not "alsa"

&gt; 
&gt; I hadn't the chance to test my most wanted 64 bit as my main lap(x64) was not available :-(
&gt; I'll try this evening
&gt; And post what is showing in Jackportaudio when open first.
&gt; 
&gt; regards
&gt; Panos
&gt;
