Maybe even if posix shell commandline quoting is assumed, it should be
explicitly defined. The quoting does not apply only to session dir but
also to other parts of the commandline. The app being started by
receives its arguments in the argv array. The exec() does not do any
de-quoting as well. Single-line commandline string seems to be not
conforming to the ANSI/POSIX API spirit, but given that the session API
is already public, this detail should be explicitly stated.
