Hi Stéphane,

I had a little more time this evening to test some more applications
on my desktop computer.

Using the 32/64-bit installer and after using regsvr32 to register the
jackrouter 64-bit dll I have successfully run:

Hauptwerk 64-bit
Reaper 64-bit
Kontakt 4 64-bit
Cantable 2.0 Lite 64-bit
Sonar 8 64-bit

Using the same Jack instance I have not been able to run the following
32-bit applications :(

GrandOrgue - there is no JackRouter in the ASIO devices dropdown
Hauptwerk 32-bit - there is no JackRouter in the ASIO devices dropdown
Sony SoundForge 32-bit  - there is no JackRouter in the ASIO devices dropdown
Reaper 32-bit   - there IS a JackRouter in the ASIO drivers list, but
no inputs or outputs are available when selecting it.
SaviHost VST   - there is no JackRouter in the ASIO devices dropdown

This in on the desktop computer.

HOWEVER, on the Laptop, which has had the first and second versions
installed, I can run BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit applications just fine...
32-bit GrandOrgue, SoundForge, Reaper, SaviHost all find a JackRouter
and connect to it.

So, what is the difference between the two installations? What should
I look for, try, etc.
