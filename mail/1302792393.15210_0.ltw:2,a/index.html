Le 14 avr. 2011 &#xE0; 16:12, Erik De Schrijver a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Hello Graham,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for informing me.
&gt; 
&gt; Hello St&#xE9;phane,
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Should i subscribe to the Jack-Devel list so that informing you and being informed is done in the simplest way?
&gt; Or is reporting on the resolution of my problems not really appropriate in that list?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) I installed your very latest compilation Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4300) 64 bit and registered JackRouter64.dll o.k. as requested
&gt; 
&gt; You asked me to do some further testing; i am happy to report good progress:
&gt; 
&gt; The report of jackd -d portaudio -l is with this latest version as in attached file test2.txt
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see the 64 bit driver is now recognized.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result, all 10 audio channels are now in Jack Control 's right pane.
&gt; 
&gt; Starting e.g. ReverberateLE using SaviHost, results in having it pop up in Jack Control 's right pane.
&gt; 
&gt; I shall now test more 64 bit applications, but expect them all to work without problems now.
&gt; 
&gt; (Just for info i attach also a snapshot of the different files in the subdir Focusrite Saffire/Driver)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your great support.
&gt; 
&gt; The jOrgan fluidsynth extension with ASIO support is 32 bit only.
&gt; Consequently, when running with the 64 bit driver of the Focusrite card, no ASIO driver is shown in the Audio device box of the fluidsynth extension, nor is JackRouter.
&gt; Only PortAudio default is available (and of course the Directsound drivers). Using this gives 2 audio channels, and i have sound with low latency as it should.
&gt; 
&gt; (With the previous version (38.4 kB size) report of the same command was as in attached file test1.txt
&gt; There the 32 bit driver is recognized. No wonder i had the error messages about the sound card driver as show in an earlier messages.)
&gt; 
&gt; Just one question out of interest; you stated:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	- installs 32 bits version of libraries (libjack.dll and
&gt;&gt; libjackserver.dll) so that 32 bits JACK clients can access the 64 bits running server
&gt;&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; With jOrgan/fluidsynth-with-ASIO 32 bit this works (because i have sound if using PortAudio default to access my sound card).
&gt; I guess that the lack of 64 bit support in fluidsynth-with-ASIO 32 bit explains why neither Jackrouter nor ASIO can be used.
&gt; What sound be added to fluidsynth-with-ASIO to have it supporting 32 as well as 64 bit.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again and best regards.
&gt; 
&gt; Erik.
&gt; 

No. With a 64 bits JACK server running, 64 bits clients *and* 32 bits clients should be able to access it.

If a 32 bits client does not see "JackRouter" driver, then something is wrong.

Can you test with another 32 bits client like Reaper and report : http://www.reaper.fm/download.php?

Or with Reason ?  http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/

(when failing, Reason normally prints some error messages...)

Thanks.

St&#xE9;phane
