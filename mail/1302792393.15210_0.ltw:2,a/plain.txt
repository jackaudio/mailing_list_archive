No. With a 64 bits JACK server running, 64 bits clients *and* 32 bits clients should be able to access it.

If a 32 bits client does not see "JackRouter" driver, then something is wrong.

Can you test with another 32 bits client like Reaper and report : http://www.reaper.fm/download.php?

Or with Reason ?  http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/

(when failing, Reason normally prints some error messages...)

Thanks.
