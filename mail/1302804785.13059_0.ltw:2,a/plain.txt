Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Updated for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4300) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Hi Guys,

As soon as Stéphane is happy to release this to the public I plan to
write a full tutorial for Jack for Windows users. This has been on my
list of 'things to do' for years now, so I think that at this
milestone, this is the correct time to do it right.

I do have a few questions that will need answers before I start work on it.

1) Where would it be best to host the Tutorial?
2) Would all of you be willing to proof read / comment / add
information where needed?
3) Are there any volunteers to help with translating a tutorial like
this into other languages?

Kind regards,
GrahamG
