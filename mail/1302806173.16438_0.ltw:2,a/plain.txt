I think you're saying that you'd like to see virtual ports for ALSA
software.  I wouldn't put this in the 'alsarawmidi' driver, as it
specifically communicates using ALSA rawmidi ports, while software
using ALSA MIDI directly uses the ALSA seq interface.

I thought about writing an ALSA seq driver that does this, but I'm not
really motivated to do it for a couple reasons:

1.) `a2jmidid` handles this case, and does it very well.
2.) I want to break myself of the habit of using software that uses
ALSA MIDI to communicate with other software.  JACK MIDI has a lot
more to offer; it's sample accurate and has a simple, elegant API,
amongst other things.

I think a better idea would be to convince authors of software that
uses ALSA MIDI to extend their applications with JACK MIDI
functionality.
