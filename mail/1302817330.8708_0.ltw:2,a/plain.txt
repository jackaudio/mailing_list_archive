I think MIDI should be tested fist: there a WinMME/JACK Midi available in the package, to activate it:

jackd -S -X winmme -d portaudio XXXX (or in QjackCtl)

Then WinMME port are "redirected" as JACK MIDI ports, it can be tested probably with :

foo-yc20 : http://code.google.com/p/foo-yc20/

LinuxSampler: http://www.linuxsampler.org/ 

that are *native* JACK  clients (so accessing the JACK API directly, not sure about the publishd binary LinuxSample, but it could be compiled for that, since the code is there...)

Then those clients can be triggered by external MIDI devices or internal using Maple MIDI IAC.
