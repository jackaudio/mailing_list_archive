Hi Stéphane,

Just a quick testing report from my tests last night:

32-bit Install:
On first install JackRouter was not present to any applications. This
was the first time that the included VC++ 2010 Redistributable was
installed. Knowing about dependencies, etc, after making sure that
there was nothing else preventing JackRouter from being found I then
ran the installation for a second time, and JackRouter was then
available to the 32-bit ASIO apps. So the assumption is that is wasn't
able to register the dll on the first install...

Is there a way to have the VC++ 2010 Redistributable install before Jack?

Succesfully Tested With 32-bit versions of:
GrandOrgue
Hauptwerk
Reaper
Sony Soundforge
Sonar v6
LinuxSampler

I'll be testing the 32/64 tonight and the MIDI capabilities.

(BTW, the latest LinuxSampler windows binary does not have Jack MIDI
capability as the only option giving when creating a MIDI port is
MME).

Kind regards,
GrahamG
