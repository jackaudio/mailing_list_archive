Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Updated for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4300) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Same here .
All ok on second install. then works smooth.

Reaper, GrandOrgue, Hauptwerk, Kontakt4, jOrgan3.13b6, Reaktor5,Linuxsampler, Engine v2, Savihosted VST effects and instruments all 32bit, Muse Score 1, Viena
All played good as expected.

I tried some midi, like controlling Kontakt4 and Reaktor5 from the same keyboard but I haven't succeed, 95% from something I missed in control setup..... I'll try again this evening when on my keyboard.

best

Hi Stéphane,

Just a quick testing report from my tests last night:

32-bit Install:
On first install JackRouter was not present to any applications. This
was the first time that the included VC++ 2010 Redistributable was
installed. Knowing about dependencies, etc, after making sure that
there was nothing else preventing JackRouter from being found I then
ran the installation for a second time, and JackRouter was then
available to the 32-bit ASIO apps. So the assumption is that is wasn't
able to register the dll on the first install...

Is there a way to have the VC++ 2010 Redistributable install before Jack?

Succesfully Tested With 32-bit versions of:
GrandOrgue
Hauptwerk
Reaper
Sony Soundforge
Sonar v6
LinuxSampler

I'll be testing the 32/64 tonight and the MIDI capabilities.

(BTW, the latest LinuxSampler windows binary does not have Jack MIDI
capability as the only option giving when creating a MIDI port is
MME).

Kind regards,
GrahamG
