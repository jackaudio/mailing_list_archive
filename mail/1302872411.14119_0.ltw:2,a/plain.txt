this is actually quite hard to do. as i've mentioned several times before:

   * JACK MIDI is a very natural API to use if you use MIDI data
inside process(), and a rather cumbersome one to use
     if you are using MIDI data outside of the process callback
(because you somehow have to get the data across
     thread boundaries)

  * ALSA MIDI is much easier to use if you don't need MIDI directly
inside process(), but is very cumbersome to use
    if you do (same reason as above)

so, yes, for MIDI-driven synthesizers of all kinds, JACK MIDI is
great. For other apps, its not so clearly a win.
