Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Proposal: Jack Audio and Jack MIDI support for the LinuxSamper Windows Build

Hi Guys,

I've been involved with testing the 32/64 bit version of Jack for
Windows (1.9.8), which now has full Jack Audio and Jack Midi support.
So, given that milestone for Windows based audio users, I wanted to
propose that LinuxSampler also support Jack in Windows. As the Jack
API is the same in Windows and Linux, the biggest job would be
formating the LinuxSampler Jack driver code so that it would compile
in Windows.

As a non-programmer I'm afraid my biggest contribution is going to be
testing and helping others use LinuxSampler. As jOrgan host a
LinuxSampler extension there is a good chance of gaining more users
through testing functionality like this.

Is this proposal possible?

Kind regards,
GrahamG
