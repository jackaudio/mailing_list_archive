So, the issue is getting thread data across boundaries.

Here is the main data structure that I used to get MIDI data across
thread boundaries for the various JACK 2 MIDI drivers:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/trunk/jackmp/common/JackMidiAsyncQueue.cpp
    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/trunk/jackmp/common/JackMidiAsyncQueue.h

(Pardon the camel case function names.  It's a JACK 2 convention.)

I've found it pretty easy to use when working on the MIDI drivers, and
have been able to use a semaphore to extend it when I need to block
until MIDI messages are available.

Is this an adequate solution?  If so, what would need to be done to
make it more accessible to coders that are having the problems with
JACK MIDI you described above?
