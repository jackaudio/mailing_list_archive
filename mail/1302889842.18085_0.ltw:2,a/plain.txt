Very cool.  I'll try to write down some notes as I play with it, because
it seems that there is no mention of that tool in the FAQ, and I did not
see an entry for the tool on trac.jackaudio.org.  Using google to search
jackaudio.org, the only mention I found of jdelay or jack_iodelay was in
the source tree.  This email is in fact the first that I have heard of the
tool.

Since jack_iodelay can measure in rather small increments,  I was a little
confused about whether that argument should be given to jack in
milliseconds or frames, and it turns out that "jackd --help" has no
mention of those flags, and the man page for jackd only has -I for audio
device ID or number of midi inputs, and -O is only number of midi outputs.
 This is with jackdmp SVN 4299.
Is that feature only in jack 1, or is it just not documented with jack2?
