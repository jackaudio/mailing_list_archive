you've got a digital loopback, it appears.

my instructions were wrong. sorry. subtract frames/period from
jack_iodelay's answer, then divide by 2 for the input/output numbers.
note that dividing by 2 is a heuristic: if you used different devices
for A/D and D/A, it would not necessarily be correct.
