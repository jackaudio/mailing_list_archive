Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack 0.120 - ALSA backend

A second quick question: have there been changes to
the ALSA backend recently ?


I can now trigger the problem reported before quite
easily.

1. Start jack using the ALSA backend and with -n 3.

2. Start and wire up jack_iodelay. Make the required
   external loopback.Â There is already a chance that
   it will show the latency for -n 2 instead of the
   expected one. In any case leave it running.

3. Start a second jack client, one that will not 
   exit cleanly but trigger a 'subgraph time out'
   when termintated with ctl-C. Jack_iodelay itself
   will do fine. No need to connect its ports.

4. Terminate the second app. There is a good chance
   that the measured delay will switch between the
   expected values for -n 2 and -n 3.

5. When the latency is the -n 2 value, check that
   the signal is still passing via the external
   loopback by disconnecting it for a second.

6. Repeat 3,4,5 to taste.


Conclusions:

* Measuring the latency for -n 2 while it should be
  the one for -n 3, and the signal used *is* the one
  via the external loopback is possible only if there
  is some error in setting up the ALSA device in the
  backend. There is no way the jack engine could 
  'short circuit' the loop if signal being measured
  is passing via the external loopback.

* This is confirmed by a 'subgraph timeout' triggering
  a change in measured latency. IIRC this means a
  restart of the ALSA device. 

So I'm now pretty sure there is some problem in the
ALSA backend.

Ciao,
