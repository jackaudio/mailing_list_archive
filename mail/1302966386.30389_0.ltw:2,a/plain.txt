the diff is attached.
i dont really see anything that might cause it.

the most possible i am currently seeing is 
http://trac.jackaudio.org/changeset/4126

i dont have a loopback here.
but if the problem is easily reproducible, you could just bisect it.

http://eu.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html

i updated the master branch on
git://hochstrom.endofinternet.org/jack.git

git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good 0.118.0 

should get you going.

So it randomly siwtches between 2 and 3 ?

dont really have an idea on this one.
