&gt; I am running Ardour 3 build alpha 4.  Do you mean current as in alpha
&gt; builds, or current as in 2.8.11?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if you saw the original description I wrote from several days
&gt; ago, but I don't see how this case can get any simpler.
&gt; Basically route a track to a physical output, connect that physical output
&gt; back to a physical input, and route that input to another track.
&gt; Trying to simulate a perfect percussionist who hears a click track in the
&gt; headphones, and synchronizes playing exactly to the click track, then
&gt; another percussionist listens to the first track, and lays down another
&gt; track while keeping time perfectly to the first track heard in headphones.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that in reality you probably would not keep changing reference
&gt; track, everyone would be listening to the click.  And just to be clear, I
&gt; have no complaint now with A3 alpha 4 with jack 2 SVN and my PCI card
&gt; (envy24 based).  That works well.

OK

&gt; A3 alpha4 with jack 1.9.6 seemed broken,

The new API for latency management was introduced *after* jack 1.9.6, so this may explain that.

&gt; and A3 alpha4 with jack2 SVN and
&gt; a USB interface still seems off.

And here it may be an incorrect report of latency at ALSA level?
