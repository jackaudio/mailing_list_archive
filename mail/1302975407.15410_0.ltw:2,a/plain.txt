@StÃ©phane: I've committed what I believe is a fix for this to the
newer-midi branch (amongst other fixes and optimizations for
'alsarawmidi' and minor changes to common MIDI queue files).  You can
merge at your convenience.  As usual, the WinMME fix stuff isn't
tested to due lack of a WinMME development environment.  Please test
first. :)

AFAIK, this case isn't documented in the WinMME documentation.
However, it does make sense to return the buffer to the application in
some fashion when 'midiInStop' is called.

This case and the above case are *probably* due to the same issue.
