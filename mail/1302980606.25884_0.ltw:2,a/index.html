&gt; &gt;&gt; JACK requires realtime scheduling privileges, which the standard Linux

&gt; &gt;&gt; John
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can someone explain what the difference between realtime scheduling and
&gt; &gt; realtime preempting is?  I know what the words mean, but what  does a system
&gt; &gt; do differently in each case?
&gt; 
&gt; simple, short answer limited to SCHED_FIFO realtime scheduling:
&gt; 
&gt;    * a thread that is set to run with SCHED_FIFO will run forever, or
&gt; until it blocks
&gt;         (e.g. it goes to sleep or does file i/o). it will also be
&gt; temporarily interrupted
&gt;         by an interrupt handler, for as long as the handler runs.
&gt; 
&gt; this is totally unlike normal scheduling, where threads will be
&gt; stopped so that something else can run for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; that's realtime scheduling, and access to it is "controlled" on linux
&gt; (not on OS X)
&gt; 
&gt; realtime preemption is a bad name, but what is generally being
&gt; referred to is how interrupts are handled. in a regular kernel, when a
&gt; device
&gt; interrupts the CPU, the handler will run right away and will continue
&gt; to run until its finished. in kernels with threaded interrupt handlers
&gt; (the most important part of "realtime preemption"), only a tiny part
&gt; of the handler will run, and the rest of it takes place in a thread
&gt; whose priority can be controlled. this means that bulk of the work
&gt; done by an interrupt handler for, say, a video device or a keyboard or
&gt; network interface can be explicitly prioritized to be "less important"
&gt; than a SCHED_FIFO thread, meaning that even interrupts from these
&gt; devices will have very little impact on the execution of the
&gt; SCHED_FIFO thread's code. there are other aspects to "realtime
&gt; preemption", but its not really worth getting into them here.

Thank you Paul!  I had to read it twice, but that was a very clear
explanation.
