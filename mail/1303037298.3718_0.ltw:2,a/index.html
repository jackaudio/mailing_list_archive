&gt; &gt; A second quick question: have there been changes to
&gt; &gt; the ALSA backend recently ?
&gt; 
&gt; the diff is attached.
&gt; i dont really see anything that might cause it.
&gt; 
&gt; the most possible i am currently seeing is 
&gt; http://trac.jackaudio.org/changeset/4126
&gt; 
&gt; i dont have a loopback here.
&gt; but if the problem is easily reproducible, you could just bisect it.
&gt; 
&gt; http://eu.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html
&gt; 
&gt; i updated the master branch on
&gt; git://hochstrom.endofinternet.org/jack.git
&gt; 
&gt; git bisect start
&gt; git bisect bad
&gt; git bisect good 0.118.0 
&gt; 
&gt; should get you going.
 
Unfortunately I have already put more time into this than
I can afford at the moment. The problem seems to be easy
to reproduce (the procedure below never fails for me),
it affects Jack's core functionality, so I'd expect the
Jack devs to look into it. But apart from your reply 
it doesn't seem to be taken seriously.

 
&gt; &gt; I can now trigger the problem reported before quite
&gt; &gt; easily.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Start jack using the ALSA backend and with -n 3.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Start and wire up jack_iodelay. Make the required
&gt; &gt;    external loopback.&#xA0;There is already a chance that
&gt; &gt;    it will show the latency for -n 2 instead of the
&gt; &gt;    expected one. In any case leave it running.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. Start a second jack client, one that will not 
&gt; &gt;    exit cleanly but trigger a 'subgraph time out'
&gt; &gt;    when termintated with ctl-C. Jack_iodelay itself
&gt; &gt;    will do fine. No need to connect its ports.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. Terminate the second app. There is a good chance
&gt; &gt;    that the measured delay will switch between the
&gt; &gt;    expected values for -n 2 and -n 3.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 5. When the latency is the -n 2 value, check that
&gt; &gt;    the signal is still passing via the external
&gt; &gt;    loopback by disconnecting it for a second.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 6. Repeat 3,4,5 to taste.
&gt; 
&gt; So it randomly siwtches between 2 and 3 ?

It more or less alternates between the two, with
some random element being involved as well.

As posted before, what happens is that after a
subgraph timeout (which is reported) sometimes
the alsa device is restarted (as it should be),
and sometimes (when in the '-n 3' state) it
isn't. Since in the same cycle there was no
driver-&gt;write() (as the result of the timeout),
things continue to work but with a period shift
between playback and capture, as if '-n 2'. 
When a new timeout occurs in that state it will
trigger a stop/start, restoring the original
conditions. So the net result is that the system
almost alternates between the two states.

The key to solving this will be to find out why
the subgraph timeout does not always trigger a
restart. I suspect some race condition in the 
error checking, but I'm not at all familiar with
those parts of the code.

Ciao,
