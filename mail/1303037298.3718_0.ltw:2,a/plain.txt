Unfortunately I have already put more time into this than
I can afford at the moment. The problem seems to be easy
to reproduce (the procedure below never fails for me),
it affects Jack's core functionality, so I'd expect the
Jack devs to look into it. But apart from your reply 
it doesn't seem to be taken seriously.

It more or less alternates between the two, with
some random element being involved as well.

As posted before, what happens is that after a
subgraph timeout (which is reported) sometimes
the alsa device is restarted (as it should be),
and sometimes (when in the '-n 3' state) it
isn't. Since in the same cycle there was no
driver->write() (as the result of the timeout),
things continue to work but with a period shift
between playback and capture, as if '-n 2'. 
When a new timeout occurs in that state it will
trigger a stop/start, restoring the original
conditions. So the net result is that the system
almost alternates between the two states.

The key to solving this will be to find out why
the subgraph timeout does not always trigger a
restart. I suspect some race condition in the 
error checking, but I'm not at all familiar with
those parts of the code.

Ciao,
