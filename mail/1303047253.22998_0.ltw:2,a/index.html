&gt; It more or less alternates between the two, with
&gt; some random element being involved as well.
&gt; 
&gt; As posted before, what happens is that after a
&gt; subgraph timeout (which is reported) sometimes
&gt; the alsa device is restarted (as it should be),
&gt; and sometimes (when in the '-n 3' state) it
&gt; isn't. Since in the same cycle there was no
&gt; driver-&gt;write() (as the result of the timeout),
&gt; things continue to work but with a period shift
&gt; between playback and capture, as if '-n 2'. 
&gt; When a new timeout occurs in that state it will
&gt; trigger a stop/start, restoring the original
&gt; conditions. So the net result is that the system
&gt; almost alternates between the two states.

I found out a bit more.

1. It seems the ALSA device restart is triggered by
an error condition in alsa_driver_wait() and not
by the engine.

2. OTOH the engine, when there is subgraph timeout,
(in this case due to an app not closing down cleanly)
will not call driver-&gt;write() for the current cycle. 

With -n 3, (2) can happen without (1), as as far as
ALSA is concerned there is no problem - it still has
almost a complete period before anything overruns.

Now to keep things in sync either each cycle must be
completed fully, including writing to the ALSA device,
or the device must be restarted. This really should
be enforced 'by design' but it isn't.

There seem to be two solutions: 

A. Make sure the ALSA device is restarted when the
engine does not complete the cycle. This would 
negate any advantage there is to using -n 3, the
whole point of it is that an occasional single cycle
taking a bit too long is not fatal.

B. Always complete the cycle by calling driver-write().
