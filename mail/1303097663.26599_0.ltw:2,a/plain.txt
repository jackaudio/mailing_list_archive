Subject:     [Jack-Devel] extra latency compensation was Re: is this latency coming from ALSA, jack, or ardour?

OK, understanding extra latency compensation better now, but still a bit
confused by the results.  I can't seem to reconcile the results from
jack_iodelay with the track to track delays I see in Ardour 3.

I haven't really optimized this setup yet, so I'm running 1024
frames/period, 3 periods/buffer.

So according to jack_iodelay, the additional latency not due to the period
buffer is 3131 frames (4155 - 1024 frames per period).

So 3131 frames is about 71 ms at 44100 frames/second.  I don't see
anywhere near 71ms offset when I record one track out of Ardour, and
physically loop back to a second track in Ardour.  Does that make any
sense? Shouldn't that extra latency show up in a time offset between
tracks?
I tried using that 3131 value, and used 1566 for the values passed to the
-I and -O arguments, but it made alignment between tracks noticeably
worse.  And the delay became negative, the audio on the second track was
70 ms ahead of the first track.  That matches pretty closely the 3131
frames number, but the direction implies that the correction wasn't
needed.  How could that be?

I changed the jackd settings to use 512 frames per period, 2 periods per
buffer, and jack_iodelay reports 1595 frames latency. 1595-512 = 1083
frames "extra" latency.

I expected the "extra" latency to be due to the latency in the AD
conversion and DA conversion, and to be constant for a given sample rate. 
Why such a large difference in extra latency when the period size is
changed?

These results are confounding my expectations, and I have to think that
either there is something fundamental I missed in the setup, or the test
methodology has a big hole I can't see.  Anyone else see what is going on
that I'm missing?
