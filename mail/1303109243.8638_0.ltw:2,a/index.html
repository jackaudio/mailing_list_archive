&gt; OK, understanding extra latency compensation better now, but still a bit
&gt; confused by the results.  I can't seem to reconcile the results from
&gt; jack_iodelay with the track to track delays I see in Ardour 3.

&gt; &gt; OK, so now I connected jack_delay out to the card physical output port,
&gt; then connected the card physical input port to jack_delay in, and got
&gt; this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4155.593 frames     94.231 ms
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't really optimized this setup yet, so I'm running 1024
&gt; frames/period, 3 periods/buffer.
&gt; 
&gt; So according to jack_iodelay, the additional latency not due to the period
&gt; buffer is 3131 frames (4155 - 1024 frames per period).
&gt; 
&gt; So 3131 frames is about 71 ms at 44100 frames/second.  I don't see
&gt; anywhere near 71ms offset when I record one track out of Ardour, and
&gt; physically loop back to a second track in Ardour.  Does that make any
&gt; sense? Shouldn't that extra latency show up in a time offset between
&gt; tracks?
&gt; I tried using that 3131 value, and used 1566 for the values passed to the
&gt; -I and -O arguments, but it made alignment between tracks noticeably
&gt; worse.  And the delay became negative, the audio on the second track was
&gt; 70 ms ahead of the first track.  That matches pretty closely the 3131
&gt; frames number, but the direction implies that the correction wasn't
&gt; needed.  How could that be?
&gt; 
&gt; I changed the jackd settings to use 512 frames per period, 2 periods per
&gt; buffer, and jack_iodelay reports 1595 frames latency. 1595-512 = 1083
&gt; frames "extra" latency.
&gt; 
&gt; I expected the "extra" latency to be due to the latency in the AD
&gt; conversion and DA conversion, and to be constant for a given sample rate. 
&gt; Why such a large difference in extra latency when the period size is
&gt; changed?
&gt; 
&gt; These results are confounding my expectations, and I have to think that
&gt; either there is something fundamental I missed in the setup, or the test
&gt; methodology has a big hole I can't see.  Anyone else see what is going on
&gt; that I'm missing?

You're missing the periods/buffer value, and the additional period of
latency you get from JACK2's asynchronous mode.

4155 - (1024 * (3 + 1)) = 59 frames
1595 - (512 * (2 + 1)) = 59 frames

Peter.
