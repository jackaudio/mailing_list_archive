Excellent.  Thank you very much. :)

The jitter here closely resembles USB jitter.  Maybe the jitter here
is due to IRQ threads being at default priorities, though the jitter
is pretty evenly spread in the 1 millisecond range, which makes me
think that's probably not the case.  Maybe the sound card or driver
has a millisecond resolution for MIDI processing.  Not sure.

I think that's a great idea.  I'm actually nearly done doing that now,
though I may go to sleep before pushing the code.

Question: Is the callback function set via
'jack_set_port_connect_callback' supposed to be realtime safe?  I
can't find the answer in the JACK documentation.
