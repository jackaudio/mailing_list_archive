Subject:     [Jack-Devel] A couple of questions about Jackdmp

Q1.  When I first downloaded the source for jackdmp (circa 2009) building under VC++ wasn't yet supported, although I managed to modify the code to make it build successfully.  However, this has left me with code that's growing progressively out of date.  In recent mailings I've noticed some references to the VC++10 runtime and redistributables.  So does this mean that VC++ is now a supported compiler?  If so, maybe I should consider upgrading to the latest source code.

Q2.  If I understand Jackdmp's command line parameters, the parameter "-T" makes Jackdmp "temporary".  I think this means that if a client launches Jackdmp using the "-T" parameter, Jackdmp should unload itself when there are no more clients connected.  Have I understood that correctly?  It's the only thing that doesn't seem to work in my Windows build so I'd like to figure out where I should start looking for the problem.
