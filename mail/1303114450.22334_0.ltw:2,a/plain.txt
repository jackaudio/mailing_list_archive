Great! Please let me know when you publish it. I'd like to setup a
ladish studio for measuring midi and audio (via jack_iodelay)
latency/jitter.

For jack2 you can sleep in the connect callback. I'm not sure for latest
jack1. I know for sure that older versions of jack1 required rt-safe
connect callback. I think this is not the case anymore but i'm not sure
if this improvement is in jack1, tscack or both.
