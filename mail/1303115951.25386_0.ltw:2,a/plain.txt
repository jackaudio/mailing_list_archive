> Q1.  When I first downloaded the source for jackdmp (circa 2009) building under VC++ wasn't yet supported,

I actually *was* for VC++ 2006, but not maintained anymore..


> although I managed to modify the code to make it build successfully.  However, this has left me with code that's growing progressively out of date.  In recent mailings I've noticed some references to the VC++10 runtime and redistributables.

Only to compile JackRouter ASIO driver, not for jack2 itself.

Nope. I'm currently using  TDM-GCC 64/32 bits compiler (http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/start) under CodeBlocks IDE (http://www.codeblocks.org/)

> Q2.  If I understand Jackdmp's command line parameters, the parameter "-T" makes Jackdmp "temporary".  I think this means that if a client launches Jackdmp using the "-T" parameter, Jackdmp should unload itself when there are no more clients connected.  Have I understood that correctly?

Yes.
