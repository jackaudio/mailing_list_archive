No, it is 

4155 - 3 * 1024 = 1083    for jack1, or
4155 - 4 * 1024 = 59      if you use jack2 in its default mode.

No, 

1595 - 2 * 512 = 571      for jack1, or
1595 - 3 * 512 = 59       if you use jack2 in its default mode.


These results make me think that you are indeed using jack2 in its
default mode wich adds 1 extra period of latency.

You are missing the correct way to calculate the extra latency.

   measured_latency - n * p           for jack1 or
   measured_latency - (n + 1) * p     for jack2 in its default mode. 

where n and p are the values given to the -n and -p options.
