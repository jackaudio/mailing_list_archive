&gt; &gt; &gt; So it randomly siwtches between 2 and 3 ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It more or less alternates between the two, with
&gt; &gt; some random element being involved as well.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As posted before, what happens is that after a
&gt; &gt; subgraph timeout (which is reported) sometimes
&gt; &gt; the alsa device is restarted (as it should be),
&gt; &gt; and sometimes (when in the '-n 3' state) it
&gt; &gt; isn't. Since in the same cycle there was no
&gt; &gt; driver-&gt;write() (as the result of the timeout),
&gt; &gt; things continue to work but with a period shift
&gt; &gt; between playback and capture, as if '-n 2'. 
&gt; &gt; When a new timeout occurs in that state it will
&gt; &gt; trigger a stop/start, restoring the original
&gt; &gt; conditions. So the net result is that the system
&gt; &gt; almost alternates between the two states.
&gt; 
&gt; I found out a bit more.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. It seems the ALSA device restart is triggered by
&gt; an error condition in alsa_driver_wait() and not
&gt; by the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. OTOH the engine, when there is subgraph timeout,
&gt; (in this case due to an app not closing down cleanly)
&gt; will not call driver-&gt;write() for the current cycle. 
&gt; 
&gt; With -n 3, (2) can happen without (1), as as far as
&gt; ALSA is concerned there is no problem - it still has
&gt; almost a complete period before anything overruns.
&gt; 
&gt; Now to keep things in sync either each cycle must be
&gt; completed fully, including writing to the ALSA device,
&gt; or the device must be restarted. This really should
&gt; be enforced 'by design' but it isn't.
&gt; 
&gt; There seem to be two solutions: 
&gt; 
&gt; A. Make sure the ALSA device is restarted when the
&gt; engine does not complete the cycle. This would 
&gt; negate any advantage there is to using -n 3, the
&gt; whole point of it is that an occasional single cycle
&gt; taking a bit too long is not fatal.
&gt; 
&gt; B. Always complete the cycle by calling driver-write().

B is the right thing to do, will look into it this evening.
i dont remember, why i have changed this.
