&gt;&gt; With regard to Visual C++ the only major change I needed to implement was to use the threading library 'pthread_win32' as opposed to regular pthread.  
&gt; 
&gt; Hum... jack2 on WIndows does not use "pthread": it directly uses Windows threads (look at JackWinThread.cpp file)
&gt; 
Okay - in that case the pthread change must also have been needed for my Cygwin build for some reason.  Now that I've abandoned Cygwin I might upgrade to Jack2 with a view to building with VC++.  It looks like the version I'm currently using (Jackdmp 1.9) didn't require as many changes as I thought.


&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; #ifndef WIN32
&gt;&gt;           exit(0);
&gt;&gt; #endif
&gt;&gt;       }
&gt;&gt;   }
&gt;&gt; }
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I assume that if I removed  #ifndef WIN32  in the above code, my server would magically unload itself when there are no more clients left - but I'm curious to know why the condition was ever there.  Is it still present in the latest code and/or can anyone remember why it's needed?

&gt; The whole "temporary" machinery has been redesigned since and works also on Windows.
&gt; 
I implemented that change anyway and it seemed to have the desired effect.  No untoward consequences so far, although I've only tested it for a few minutes.
