Okay - in that case the pthread change must also have been needed for my Cygwin build for some reason.  Now that I've abandoned Cygwin I might upgrade to Jack2 with a view to building with VC++.  It looks like the version I'm currently using (Jackdmp 1.9) didn't require as many changes as I thought.

I implemented that change anyway and it seemed to have the desired effect.  No untoward consequences so far, although I've only tested it for a few minutes.
