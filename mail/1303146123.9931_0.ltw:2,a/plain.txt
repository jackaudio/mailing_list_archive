well, yes and no. we've never "required" an RT safe connect callback
in the sense that we attempt to enforce or even detect it. but
inasmuch as the connect callback is running in the same thread, its
better if it doesn't do too much.

note that this is also only jack1 on linux - its not true of jack1 on
OS X. i don't know about bsd or solaris.
