Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack RoutingTroubles

Hi there,
 
I’m having trouble routing audio from traktor to ableton
 
I am using pc with windows 7 32 bit  Intel core i7 870 with 8 GB Ram
 
I installed the latest jack 1.9.7 and start trying to route my software  
following video instruction from dubspot but unfortunately its only refer to Mac
 
And this is where my problem starts 
 
1)      In jack for Mac Setting there are jackrouter virtual In and Out Channels 
which are not showed on Jack for Pc setting
2)      In Ableton for mac setting there is option to choose the Driver type as 
Coreaudio (If I understand it correct for pc it should be Portaudio)
But unfortunately again on my ableton setting I can´t find any option to choose 
the portaudio as driver just Asio and then I can choose jackrouter as
An audio Device which in this case I don’t have any further options to choose 
audio input and output device
 
I have attached snap shots from my setting and from the tutorial video for mac
 
I really hope you can help me solve this problem
 
Any help will be much appreciate
 
Tnx and Nice weekend
 
Dan
