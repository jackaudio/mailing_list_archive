i've already mentioned that there are bugs with this in all released
ardour versions.

you will not get a3 doing the right thing UNLESS you disconnect a
"source" track from all other JACK ports when re-recording it to a new
track. i'm not going to explain why this is occuring - its a bug and
it will be fixed, likely in the next several days. ardour will do the
"right" thing if you switch the new track alignment to "capture time".

this is not correct. my original instructions were more correct. i
will modify jack_iodelay to print a more informative set of output
than it currently does.

its definitely not always constant w.r.t sample rate. it depends on
the nature of the converters used.
