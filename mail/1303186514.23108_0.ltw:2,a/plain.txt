Yes, but the corrected instructions from Fons seem to make my PCI
interface behave as expected.  After recording the click to track 1 via
analog loop back, I could not distinguish between the generated click
track, and the recording of the click playing back from track 1. I bounced
the recorded track to track 2, bounced track 2 to track 3, etc. via analog
loop back until I had 10 tracks, and I could unmute any of the 10 tracks
while track 1 or the generated click track was playing, and not hear an
offset.  As far as I can tell, with my PCI card, the compensation is
effectively perfect now.

OK, if you say so, but it seems to work for me.  The input of each track
was connected to the card physical input ports, and the output of each
track went to the master bus.

That made the alignment much worse when I tried it.

The disturbing part, after getting the latency compensation working
effectively perfectly for my PCI card, is that my USB interface is
inconsistent in a way that I think jack cannot be involved.  I used the
same process as for my PCI card, but with my USB interface, and the first
5 tracks aligned perfectly, then the 6th and subsequent tracks diverged by
about 1ms per track (audio for later tracks being aligned earlier in time
than the first tracks).  I tried exactly the same process again on a new
session, and that time the 1st track was ahead of the click by about
0.75ms, the second track was ahead of the first by about 0.25ms.  The 10th
track ended up ahead of the generated click by about 8 ms.

I created a third session and did the same things again, but this time
each track had the alignment set to align with capture time, and each
track was delayed 77ms relative to the previous track.  The 10th track
ended up 775 ms after the nominal beat/generated click, or about 700 ms
delayed relative to the first recorded track.  That definitely wasn't what
I wanted.

The difference in results between the PCI card and the USB interface, and
the fact that the USB interface wasn't consistent from session to session,
or even track to track within a session, makes me think that there is just
something off in the USB stack.  I only have the one USB interface, I
suppose my hardware could just be broken in some weird way that only
affects latency, or a bug in the device firmware.  I would want to compare
results with someone who has different USB hardware first, I guess.

So to come all the way back to the way my original question was posed, I
think the answer (to where is the extra uncompensated latency coming from)
is:

I did not understand the way latency is communicated, I thought ALSA would
provide a latency number for an interface, but you actually have to
measure it yourself.

The way you measure that latency is with the tool jack_iodelay (which is
not currently mentioned anywhere on the jack web site).

After you measure the latency with jack_iodelay, you have to massage the
returned data in a way that does not match the current man page to get
accurate results.  Additionally, you have to keep in mind the additional
period of latency added by jack2 asynchronous mode.

And on top of all that, USB still seems screwy, at least with my hardware.
 I would be interested to hear results from others with USB hardware,
especially if they can get good results.
