ALSA can't know this. Determining the number requires the user
establishes a loopback signal path, which clearly can't be assumed at
any point during driver initialization, setup, or what have you.
Remember that for any digital out, the converters don't even live on
the audio interface itself, so even if there was a standard protocol
to discover "physical latency of the soundcard" it would fail for
digital signal paths since it would rely on components not connected
via the PCI bus.
