In addition to the already mentioned USB queueing delay (up to 24 ms,
depending on the period size), USB also adds a somewhat random delay
between the playback and capture streams.  The USB host controller
drivers do not implement the support for scheduling streams at
a specific time, so the offset between both streams might be one
millisecond if the second stream start occurred one frame later, plus
any delays due to executing the code.

It is not possible for the USB hardware or the device firmware to affect
the latency in any meaningful way; all these latencies can be explained
by known deficiencies in the Linux USB stack.
