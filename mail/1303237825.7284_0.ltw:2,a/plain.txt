Hi

I am having some problems with jack I have never used it before and seems I can 
set everything up, connect devices and programs together and then all I get is 
some hum/hiss/white noise going on at a quiet level and nothing else at all.

I have tested an older version of JACK as well on x64 windows 7 using an M Audio 
10/10 and with the same results basically nothing.

I was wondering stephane if you could help me in seeing if anything I have set 
up is wrong or needs tweaking?

Thanks

Skelm
