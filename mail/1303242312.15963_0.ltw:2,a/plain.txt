Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installer for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4294) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Hi Skelm,

Are you using the Jack PortAudio shortcut to start the Jack Audio
server? If so, have you modified your target property to fully
identify your sound card? If your card has been set to the default
44100hz, your modified target property would look something like this:
jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::M-Audio Delta ASIO" -r 44100

I have written a quick draft of a tutorial for dealing with Jack for
Windows. It is a work in progress and will soon have images added. You
can review it at
(http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jorgan/index.php?title=Instructions_on_using_the_Jack_Audio_Connection_Kit_in_Windows).

Kind regards,
GrahamG
