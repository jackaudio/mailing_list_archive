Subject:     [Jack-Devel] patch for jack_iodelay man page

Attached is my submission for a patch to the man page for jack_iodelay
which incorporates the corrected instructions that Fons posted yesterday.

While double checking the command line parameters to make sure I named
them correctly in the man page, I discovered these inconsistencies in
current jack2:

The man page shows that the coreaudio backend has only the -p option, and
-n is the --name,
not --nperiods like the alsa backend.  Should coreaudio also have a way to
set the number of periods per buffer like ALSA?  If it does, it is not
documented in man page.  I could not check the --help output because the
help for the coreaudio backend does not get compiled in on my Linux
system.

Man page for net backend says -p is frames per period, jackd -d net --help
shows -p is UDP port and -n is client name, i.e. man page and --help
conflict.  In fact, jackd -d net --help does not show that frames per
period and periods per buffer can be set, but the man page does.  I have
not looked in the source yet to see which is correct.  Can -n and -p
options be set for net backend, or does the jackd running net have to get
those parameters from the jackd  at the other end of the network?

The -n option for net backend (if it can indeed be set) has different long
form than alsa backend (--num-periods vs. --nperiods). I would think that
keeping the option names consistent between the back ends is preferred
where possible.
