Hi Guys,

For those of us who have been using the power of Jack in Linux for
many years, here is a recent thread showing windows users discovering
the magic ;)

Thanks guys for a great piece of software!

hey!! im so stoked!!!
i have 10 chans looping back in now for full recording like a real
studio situation with live drums, the feel, the real cymbals of the
kit i have and the analogue recording to boot! thats massive! huge!
i maybe the first person to actually do this with a digital/analogue
kit and get a signal that way! amazing! no loss of latency what so
ever and no actual recorded midi data! wicked! like you said im using
it to trigger the vst and then send the outs of the vst out of cubase,
back into its self (which cubase will not allow without cables!) and
then onto audio chans monitoring them and sending them out to stereo
and then anything else in the mix including any other virtual
instruments recorded live, which would be the keyboards for me,
recently rhodes and piano would be used then the ux2 for 2 chans of 1
guitar and 1 bass and then have the singer singing live in the room
and record the vocals after!
i dont even need my mixer now lol haha in a way im glad it broke! ill
just buy a line6 ux8 instead!
amazing for the help i am so stoked and will test out the x64 version
now i know what im doing, but first im going to record some drums with
it and put it through the ringer for a good test first then move onto
the x64 beta version
massive, huge, massive, respect and thanks for the help and building
such an amazing tool! zero latency! its not even going out and coming
back in its just and internal route lol im actually laughing writing
this as i didnt think that was ever going to be possible without
cables or a mixer or both, of which i have done that as well with my
tascam tm-d1000 mixer as i outlined earlier!
thanks again, speak soon! pat on the back there mate amazing this is
jack audio took kit! my mate works in studios in new york and im
telling him to get it!
he didnt quite understand what i had done at first but then he all of
a sudden got it and is like "I GOT TO TEST THIS SHIT OUT!"
hehe
cheers
jp
p.s. have a good day :-)

&gt; &gt; Hi JP,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ok,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) so you are sending MIDI signals into your computer from the alesis
&gt; &gt; usb pro drum kit
&gt; &gt; 2) You are hosting the Addictive Drums vst drum module within Cubase
&gt; &gt; 3) Addictive Drums is receiving the MIDI signals and triggering drum
&gt; &gt; samples
&gt; &gt; 4) From Addictive Drums you're sending 8 channels of audio out of Cubase
&gt; &gt; 5) that you then want to come back into Cubase to do something with..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My difficulty here is that I don't know what you want to do the with
&gt; &gt; audio that comes out of the VST.... mix it, record it, analyze it,
&gt; &gt; compress it, ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If this were me... this is what I'd be doing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MIDI Drum kit -&gt; VSTHost running addictive drums vst -&gt; JackRouter -&gt;
&gt; &gt; Cubase for reverb effects -&gt; JackRouter -&gt; Soundcard....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't use Cubase so I'm not sure what it provides, but it would be
&gt; &gt; quite possible to use JackRouter to take an audio output from Cubase
&gt; &gt; (i.e. channel 1) and plug that audio into an audio input from Cubase
&gt; &gt; (i.e. channel 2).
