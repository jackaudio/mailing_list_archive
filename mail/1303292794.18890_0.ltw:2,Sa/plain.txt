Subject:     [Jack-Devel] non-callback API

Hi, is the non-callback API documented (more extensively than in the
API pages) anywhere?

In particular, I'm wondering what the constraints are for calling
jack_cycle_wait() -- what happens if I don't call it "often enough"?
I'm writing a capture-only application.
