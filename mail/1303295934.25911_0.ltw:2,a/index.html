&gt; &gt; &gt; So is this fix considered "official" ? &#xA0;(before I report it again on jack2)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; from chatting with torben yesterday, i think we're not quite done yet.
&gt; 
&gt; well... we probably need to write zeros instead of empty buffers.
&gt; but if St&#xE9;phane has that code already, it should be fine.
&gt; 
&gt; i am wondering what you mean by official ?
&gt; the old behaviour was clearly wrong. it was just that nobody really
&gt; cared before. (i have still no real explanation of why things worked,
&gt; but i know that i fixed a bug in the null cycle, and that bug might have
&gt; been "fixing" the offsets, during the client kick.
&gt; 
&gt; or we had real xruns all the time anyways.

It's the sort of thing that can easily go undetected. The server still
works after it skipped a write(), and the only results would be a glitch
in the output (which is expected anyway when starting and stopping new
clients, at least with Jack1), and a change of the latency.

A driver-&gt;write_zeros() would be useful anyway. When I started looking
into this problem I wrongly assumed that the problem was something with
the start() function. There is a long standing warning there "Actually
this is cheating etc." about zeroing the entire playback buffer within
a single mmap_begin(), mmap_commit() pair. So changing that was the
first thing I tried. You could use the write_zeros() there as well, and
as part of the idle cycle code.

I can't help but feel that the whole ALSA backend is overly complicated.
For example I still have no idea what the 'extra_fd' stuff in wait() is
about :-) The wait() code in libclalsadrv (which is very similar to the
backend) doesn't have it and works OK. Same about the 'linux poll bug'.
