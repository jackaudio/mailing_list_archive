OK. Actually process() taking too long would be equivalent to the code
between cycle_wait() and cycle_signal() taking too long, right?
Instead I'm asking about the other half -- the code between
cycle_signal() and cycle_wait() taking too long.

But you probably meant that the effects are the same -- which seems reasonable.
