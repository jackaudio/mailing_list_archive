It would be equivalent to doing the extra work (taking the 
extra time) at the beginning of your process() -- i.e. the 
same thing.  You'll zombie.

From the time that jack signals you to the time that you 
signal jack... that's the critical time.  If you take too 
long, you will cause xruns and you're client may be 
disconnected (zombie).

Strictly speaking, cycle_wait() is irrelevent.  Jack will 
signal you whether you call that function or not. 
cycle_wait() mostly keeps you from jumping the gun.  But if 
you're not ready when jack signals you... that time counts 
against you.
