???

Have you *ever* looked at how this function is implemented?

jack_cycle_wait() is the one that *blocks* until it gets resumed by the previous client in the graph, jack_cycle_signal() gives control to the next clients in the graph (by signaling their input semaphore) 

Both functions have to be used in a given cycle.
