Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack + Max 5 on Windows XP

Dear all,

I managed to extract and install Jack on my PC running Windows XP, and Max
correctly recognizes the Jack audio driver. However Max is the only
application recognized so far by the Jack Server.

Does Jack not recognize audio players such as Quicktime and Windows Media
Player, or audio coming in through my browser? Since I am a PC user I was
hoping it would perform similar tasks to Soundflower, which is Mac only.

Thanks for helping me clear this up.

Best wishes,
