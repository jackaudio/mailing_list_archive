JACK on Windows is only usable by two classes of applications:

   * native JACK applications (not very many of these)
   * applications that can use ASIO (mostly pro-audio/music creation apps)

Neither WMP nor Quicktime are ASIO-enabled, and so they cannot
interact with JACK.

JACK was not created (for Linux originally, then later OS X and later
still, Windows) as a general purpose desktop "sound server". It was
designed and engineered for pro-audio and music creation workflows.
