It's actually quite simple.

In the first implementation (which I proposed) there was no jack_cycle_signal(),
just jack_cycle_wait(), and a very simple correspondence between the transitions
in each mode:

Jack calls your callback   <----->   jack_cycle_wait() returns
the callback returns       <----->   you call jack_cycle_wait()

This just means that calls and returns are swapped, return values 
become call arguments and vice versa. You could (and probably
still can) even switch between the two modes in single client.
I used to have one doing that randomly:

int jack_process_callback (int nframes, void *userarg)
    // the one given to jack_set_process_callback()
{
    while (true)
    {
        process(nframes);
        if (randomint() & 1)
            break;
        else     
            nframes = jack_cycle_wait(0);
    }
    return 0;
}  

void process(int nframes)
    // the real processing function
{
    // do your stuff
}  


On Jack's side, there was something like this which handles
both modes and doesn't care which one the client uses:

void client_thread_main(void)
{
    int retval = 0;
    while (retval == 0)
    {
        nframes = jack_cycle_wait(retval);
        if (nframes)
            retval = user_process_callback(nframes, userarg);
        else
            break;
    }
}

int jack_cycle_wait(int retval)
{
    if (retval)
        return 0;
    wait_for_trigger_from_engine();
    return nframes;
} 


It can instructive to follow the flow of control
starting with client_thread_main()


Jack_client_signal() was added later. The original 
meaning of jack_cycle_wait() was "I'me done with
this cycle AND the next Jack client can run now".
Jack_client_signal() splits off the second part of
this, and leaves the first to jack_cycle_wait().

I don't like very much this implementation. It breaks
the symmetry of the original one. The equivalences now
become:

Jack calls your callback   <----->   jack_cycle_wait() returns
the callback returns       <----->   you call jack_cycle_signal()
                                     and jack_cycle_wait()  

A cleaner implementation would be to either:

- require jack_cycle_signal() also before returning in
  the callback, but this would break the existing API,

- or make jack_cycle_wait() perform the equivalent of
  jack_cycle_signal() if that was not called before -
  this would automatically do the same for a return
  from the callback.
