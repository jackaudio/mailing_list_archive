That is correct. But it should be possible to do exactly
the same when using the callback mode:

int process_callback(int nframes, void *arg)
{
    // Do some work.
    // ...
    // Input buffer are no longer required, output buffers
    // are ready.

    jack_cycle_signal(); // Allows the next client to run.

    // Do some other work.

    return 0
}

which mutatis mutandis is the equivalent of your example using
the callback mode.

The only requirement for this to work is that returning from the
callback and calling jack_cycle_wait() are exactly equivalent,
that is either:

1. They both require jack_cycle_signal() to be called before, or

2. They don't, or

3. They do the equivalent of jack_cycle_signal() if that was not
   already called.

Currently, returning from the callback does the equivalent of
calling jack_cycle_signal(), while calling jack_cycle_wait()
doesn't (in my original proposal it did.). A clean implementation
would give them exactly the same semantics, and to preserve the
original callback API that would mean (3). In other words, using
jack_cycle_signal() should be optional in either mode.
