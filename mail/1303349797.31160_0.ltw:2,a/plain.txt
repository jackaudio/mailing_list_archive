Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Netjack Master Standalone

Hi,

I have an embedded system running on a NIOS2 processor with an Ethernet
interface and multiple audio inputs and outputs.
I want to make this system a NETJACK master so I can send all the audio
channels to a Linux computer for processing.
I read the netjack documentation on the WEB site and started to implement it
by looking at the Jack source code and also looking at the packets with
Wireshark.
I am making progress but only slowly and was wondering if there was better
way to do this?
Also I am converting the C++ code to C because the C++ compiler does not
work on my embedded system.
Thanks,
