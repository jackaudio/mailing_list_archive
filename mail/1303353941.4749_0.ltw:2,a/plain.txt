That implies you are working from the jack 2 code base.  Jack 1 is in C,
so the compiler should not be a problem.

Jack sends all audio samples as floating point.  Does NIOS2 have any
floating point support?  Might be kind of slow if you have to convert
floating point to int in software routines.

What compiler are you using, by the way.  Doesn't NIOS2 have current gcc
support?
