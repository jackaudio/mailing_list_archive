Paul, thanks for the link, I missed it when I was looking at the WEB site.
I assumed wrongfully that Netjack2 was a replacement for Netjack1.
I need low latency so jack.trip does not seems to be a good choice for me.
I have high bandwidth (Gigabit ethernet), I don't want data compression and
my client and server both have fixed IP address so I don't need discovery.
Knowing this, is there a reason to choose Netjack2 over Netjack1 or vice
versa?
