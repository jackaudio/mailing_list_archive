Chris, yes I am currently looking at netjack2 because I assumed wrongfully
that it was a replacement for netjack1.
I am using GCC but an older version and g++ in that version is broken for
the NIOS2 platform.
The NIOS2 core I am currently using does not have floating point but because
it is running on an FPGA: the buffering management, floating point
conversion and UDP processing can be accelerated and done at line speed
(1GBit in my case) in hardware.
I want to do a first test with only a couple of channels using just software
running on the NIOS2.
Then I will start putting hardware acceleration to reach 32 channels in and
32 channels out with 256 frames per packet as a second step.
My final step is to reach 128 channels of audio in and 128 channels out at
32 frames per packet for low latency.
This system is developt as a replacement for the RME MADI cards we currently
use and if everything works will offer twice the number of channels and half
the latency we currently have with the RME cards.

&gt; That implies you are working from the jack 2 code base.  Jack 1 is in C,
&gt; so the compiler should not be a problem.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I want to make this system a NETJACK master so I can send all the audio
&gt; channels to a Linux computer for processing.
&gt;
&gt; Jack sends all audio samples as floating point.  Does NIOS2 have any
&gt; floating point support?  Might be kind of slow if you have to convert
&gt; floating point to int in software routines.
&gt;
&gt; What compiler are you using, by the way.  Doesn't NIOS2 have current gcc
&gt; support?
