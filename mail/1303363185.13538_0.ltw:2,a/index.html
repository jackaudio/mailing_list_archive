hehehe, bit of a can of worms this...

  On Jack2 'jack_load netmanager" will enable 'auto' detection of your 
slave machines and on Jack1  'jack_netsource' will enable you to program 
in your defaults for the slave(s).

The version of Jack determines which Netjack you're actually 
using.Jack1/Tschack  cannot use netjack2. Jack2 has Jack1's netjack1 
within it already, and it works very well.  It's the netone driver as 
opposed to the standard 'net' driver. .

Your milage will vary depending on a lot of variables, but features 
(netjack2 only) like jumbo packets have never worked for me - pity tho, 
'cause it may be (should be!) quite a  performance boost.  Network speed 
and Sync/Async also have been problematic.

There are 3 jacks - jack1 ,jack2 and tschack . They all have their 
strengths/weaknesses and I cannot really guide you there. What I would 
seriously suggest is, you benchmark each "jack" within it's own  family 
first, then perhaps test a mixture of them. It's a trial for sure, but 
the outcomes, when finally configured, are most satisfactory.

One important point; it is very worthwhile having a 'dedicated' audio 
network LAN - meaning no internet traffic. This made a world of 
difference in my studio to both X-Runs and Net-Xruns.

try to be scientific with your investigations - keep documentation of 
your tests and results. You won't be able to do it all in your head.
