Geoff, thanks for the response.
My Linux machines are running jack2 on Ubuntu 10.10.
I have already done some testing but only with netjack2, I will do more
testing today on both netjack1 and netjack2 to see what works better for me
for both performance and complexity of implementation for an FPGA based
netjack master.
Also my Linux boxed have dual Ethernet so one gigabit link is dedicated to
netjack.

&gt;&gt; Knowing this, is there a reason to choose Netjack2 over Netjack1 or vice

&gt; hehehe, bit of a can of worms this...
&gt;
&gt;  On Jack2 'jack_load netmanager" will enable 'auto' detection of your slave
&gt; machines and on Jack1  'jack_netsource' will enable you to program in your
&gt; defaults for the slave(s).
&gt;
&gt; The version of Jack determines which Netjack you're actually
&gt; using.Jack1/Tschack  cannot use netjack2. Jack2 has Jack1's netjack1 within
&gt; it already, and it works very well.  It's the netone driver as opposed to
&gt; the standard 'net' driver. .
&gt;
&gt; Your milage will vary depending on a lot of variables, but features
&gt; (netjack2 only) like jumbo packets have never worked for me - pity tho,
&gt; 'cause it may be (should be!) quite a  performance boost.  Network speed and
&gt; Sync/Async also have been problematic.
&gt;
&gt; There are 3 jacks - jack1 ,jack2 and tschack . They all have their
&gt; strengths/weaknesses and I cannot really guide you there. What I would
&gt; seriously suggest is, you benchmark each "jack" within it's own  family
&gt; first, then perhaps test a mixture of them. It's a trial for sure, but the
&gt; outcomes, when finally configured, are most satisfactory.
&gt;
&gt; One important point; it is very worthwhile having a 'dedicated' audio
&gt; network LAN - meaning no internet traffic. This made a world of difference
&gt; in my studio to both X-Runs and Net-Xruns.
&gt;
&gt; try to be scientific with your investigations - keep documentation of your
&gt; tests and results. You won't be able to do it all in your head.
&gt;

&gt; good luck
