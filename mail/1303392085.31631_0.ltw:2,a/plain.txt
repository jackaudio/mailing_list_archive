Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Netjack Master Standalone

Geoff, thanks for the response.
My Linux machines are running jack2 on Ubuntu 10.10.
I have already done some testing but only with netjack2, I will do more
testing today on both netjack1 and netjack2 to see what works better for me
for both performance and complexity of implementation for an FPGA based
netjack master.
Also my Linux boxed have dual Ethernet so one gigabit link is dedicated to
netjack.
