I'm not too familiar with Windows, but I'll tell you what I can:

1.) Start `jackd`.

2.) Connect a MIDI cable from one of the outputs on your MIDI
interface to one of the inputs on your MIDI interface.

3.) Start `jack_midi_latency_test` at the command line.  If you know
the names of the ports you want to connect, then you can start it
using:

    jack_midi_latency_test [out-port-name] [in-port-name]

(On Windows, this may require an .exe extension.  Or, maybe not.  I'm not sure.)

Otherwise, you can start `jack_midi_latency_test` with no arguments
and connect the input and output ports you intend to use using a GUI
JACK client.

4.) Once you get a valid test, do the following:

    jack_midi_latency_test -m 3 -s 8192 -t 5 [out-port-name] [in-port-name]

This may take a little while, depending on the settings you use to start JACK.

5.) Once the test is finished, send back the output, along with the
name of the device you used.

The results I've received so far from Windows users haven't been very
good.  Don't be surprised if there's a little more jitter than you'd
normally expect.

Thank you for your help! :)
