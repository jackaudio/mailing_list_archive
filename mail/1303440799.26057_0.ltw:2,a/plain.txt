Hi Devin,

I've merged newer-midi into ladi-experimental (not-pushed yet) and the
alsarawmidi driver does not work properly anymore. The latency test reports:

Messages sent: 1
Messages received: 0
Unexpected messages received: 1
jack_midi_latency_test: handle_process: timed out while waiting for MIDI message

Just to make sure I've connected jack-keyboard to the playback port and
gmidimonitor to the capture port. gmidimonitor reports 3-byte midi
events with all three bytes being zero.

The connection detection works. The previous commit in the
ladi-experimental branch, the one that works is the merge from svn trunk r4317
