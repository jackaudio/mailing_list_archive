Thank you Graham and Devin !

I 'll see what I can do.
So far I never experienced problems with audio Jack on windows7. 
Everything after installation and target properties for Asio4all, went ok.

I never had to use the midi function with Jack Control, as I used Jack (1.9.4 was the first) to get VST reverb for Grand Orgue program, which I controlled from my EL900 organ console. This Yamaha organ sends 3 midi channels merged from its midi output, upper ch1 or 4, lower ch2 or 5, pedal ch3.

So, when I tried other virtual instruments together, example a Mellotron on ch2, an ARP Odyssey on ch1 and a Moog Taurus on ch3, all played ok from EL900 (audio connections were made with Jack Control, all three to Lexicon PCM Savihosted).
So, I didn't bother with midi on Jack.

Later I tried my other keyboards to control these examples, and couldn't. I mean only my first connected 88mother kbd could control anyone but one at at time, Motif ES was in too, but this too could one at a time. Straight as they were inserted in my laptop. 
Usually I make virtual midi connections with MidiYoke on 32 bit and LoopMidi for both 32 &amp; 64. LoopBe1 is ok but has only one port, so I just left it there stayin'..

I follow very simple connections, just to be able to play quick.
Like : Motif ES6 has direct USB out to laptop where Asio4All is installed.
Open Jack with doubleclick on Jack Portaudio icon. Open stand alone virtual instrument where I preset Midi in from ES - 1 and audio to jackrouter. The same with the stand alone effects.

For older 88mother and EL900 there's the EST Romio II Midi to USB adapter, which works well.

Now as I understand Midi on Jack I have to define connections with the patch bay in Jack Control in order to work with Midi, no?
Like get all 3 synths in my example to be controlled by two or three keyboards ?

It may look naive as I describe, but keep in mind that I'm a musician and not a programmer and I don't speak native English, so computer terminology has a lot of difficulties from Greek to English. Also my laps here speak 70% Greek and the rest in English.... so you see...

Devin, thank you for all your efforts and all devs here, I'm extremely happy to help with tests :-)

Graham, this command has to be added on Jack Portaudio&gt;Properties&gt;Target after the command for ASIO4All v2 ?
Or on Jack Control&gt; Properties&gt;Target ?

Best
Panos

Hi Panos,

To set Jack up to use the new MIDI driver you need to add this to your
command line (target) property: -X winmme, so the command should start
like this...

jackd.exe -R -S -X winmme -d portaudio

I hope to get time this weekend to do some testing with this too

Kind regards,
GrahamG

&gt;&gt; I'm now about to test the midi functions, hmm here maybe I'll need sone
&gt;&gt; assistance, I'm afraid...
&gt;
&gt; I'm not too familiar with Windows, but I'll tell you what I can:
&gt;
&gt; 1.) Start `jackd`.
&gt;
&gt; 2.) Connect a MIDI cable from one of the outputs on your MIDI
&gt; interface to one of the inputs on your MIDI interface.
&gt;
&gt; 3.) Start `jack_midi_latency_test` at the command line.&#xA0; If you know
&gt; the names of the ports you want to connect, then you can start it
&gt; using:
&gt;
&gt;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;jack_midi_latency_test [out-port-name] [in-port-name]
&gt;
&gt; (On Windows, this may require an .exe extension.&#xA0; Or, maybe not.&#xA0; I'm not
&gt; sure.)
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise, you can start `jack_midi_latency_test` with no arguments
&gt; and connect the input and output ports you intend to use using a GUI
&gt; JACK client.
&gt;
&gt; 4.) Once you get a valid test, do the following:
&gt;
&gt;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;jack_midi_latency_test -m 3 -s 8192 -t 5 [out-port-name] [in-port-name]
&gt;
&gt; This may take a little while, depending on the settings you use to start
&gt; JACK.
&gt;
&gt; 5.) Once the test is finished, send back the output, along with the
&gt; name of the device you used.
&gt;
&gt; The results I've received so far from Windows users haven't been very
&gt; good.&#xA0; Don't be surprised if there's a little more jitter than you'd
&gt; normally expect.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your help! :)
