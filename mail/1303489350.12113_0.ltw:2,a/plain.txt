Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installers for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4340) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

To be clear, using WinMME JACK MIDI bridge does make sense only when a user wants to inject MIDI messages from WinMME world inside JACK MIDI or the contrary, so basically with *native* JACK clients.

Like for instance Sampo Foo yC20
