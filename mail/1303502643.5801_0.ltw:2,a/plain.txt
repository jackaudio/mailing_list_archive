I've tested only on Linux and only the alsa drivers. E.g., i've not
built the ffado/firewire, macos, windows and solaris specific code. I
have some access to macos and windows machine but I don't have access to
solaris. Please tell me if I'm expected to setup build evirnment for
macos and windows. Btw, we can setup a buildbot [1] with buildslaves for
different platforms. Given that the xcode/codeblocks builds are
scriptable...

Devin, I saw a comment in the alsarawmidi code about you not being sure
whether its parameters can be set. They can be set through
jackdbus. ladiconf shows empty parameter list for alsarawmidi.

I've noticed some problems with the parameter initialization code:

 1. There is some inconsistency with boolean parameters. We should set
    the .i union member but there are/were some places where other
    union member is accessed. The true/false constants are not fixed. In
    different places we have 0/1, true/false and TRUE/FALSE.

 2. CoreAudio adapter and driver had uninitialized default values for
   the 'P', 'C' and 'd' parameters. I've initialized them to empty
   strings.
