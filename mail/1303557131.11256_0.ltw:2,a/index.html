&gt; I started thinking about the way the jack process callback works, wrt midi, and I'm becoming convinced that using Jack isn't the best approach, unless I misunderstand the way it works. 
&gt; 
&gt; At the beginning of the process callback, a jack_midi_get_event_count() call is made. Then, as I walk through the frames of the buffer, I compare where I am in the buffer to the next available midi event, and if I'm on the right sample I process the midi. 
&gt; 
&gt; But I think this HAS to mean that the actual midi event happened at least one buffer's worth of data ago, right? I can't get a count of midi events at the beginning of the process callback if they haven't happened yet... 
&gt; 
&gt; I looked at the source to a2jmidid (ALSA to Jack MIDI bridge for linux) and I noticed it doesn't even bother with the timestamps (I think I've got the most recent source). So ... do people just tend to not worry about a 512 (default I think) sample delay (or the sort of jitter that a2jmidid is causing) in midi processing? 
&gt; 
&gt; This leads me to think I will use CoreMIDI to get the midi events and handle the audio the jack way.
&gt; 
&gt; Please correct me if I'm wrong,

You are both right and wrong. Right because indeed there will be one period of
latency. Wrong in assuming that you can have no latency and no jitter at the
same time. That is just the consequence of processing audio in blocks of one
period instead of doing it sample by sample and waiting a sample time between
each call.

Processing a period typically takes much less time than the period, if the
processing is not too complex it happens 'instantly' compared to the period
time. Also it doesn't have to happen at the start of a period - there could
be another audio process taking e.g. half the period time before it's your
turn. But things are OK as long as all processing is finished before the end
of the period.

All this means that the exact time at which the audio process is run is
a) unknown, and b) irrelevant, and that any attempt to deliver MIDI to
the audio process 'at the right time' is futile - it even doens't run most
of the time ! Any input to it must be buffered until it runs. The only way
to keep two or more buffered data streams synchronised is have time stamps
on all data. For audio these are implicit - the time between two samples is
fixed and you just have to count them. For MIDI or any message based data
explicit timestamps are required.

Since each process callback has to process one period's worth of whatever
inputs it gets and can't look into the future, this must be the data from
the previous period. And whatever it produces must be output from the
start of the next period. There's no way around that, and using CoreMIDI
isn't going to change that.

Most MIDI users will agree that having a fixed latency is much better than
having jitter in the same range (or more).

Decent soundcards should work well with periods much smaller than 512.

I can't comment an a2jmidi. If it doesn't calculate the timestamps 
that is obviously not correct. Don't know what the current status
is for Jack's own MIDI backends, but there is in principle no reason
why they shouldn't just work.
