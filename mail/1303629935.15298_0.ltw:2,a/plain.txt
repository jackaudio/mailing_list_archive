Subject:     [Jack-Devel] gdb-ing jack apps?

Hi,

I've been unable to debug my jack app in gdb. Take the auto-server
case. Whenever gdb stops the program due to a signal (either ^C or a
segfault) an endless stream of

subgraph starting at <client> timed out (subgraph_wait_fd=14, status =
0, state = Triggered, pollret = 0 revents = 0x0)

gets printed, and I have to kill gdb from another shell.

If I start the server from qjackctl, the same process crashes qjackctl.

I've tried exiting the process thread on lost frames, but it doesn't help.

I've seen reports of jackd and gdb on the net, so there has to be a
way. What could be the problem? I am of course not expecting to stop a
jack app and then continue, but at least I want to be able to see
backtraces, inspect variables etc in gdb.

Thanks,
Dan
