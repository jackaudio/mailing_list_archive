i know that some people do seem to have problems using JACK and gdb.
but others (e.g. myself) never have (modulo the usual issues with not
running in RT mode and using a long timeout. i routinely run ardour
inside gdb a lot, and stop in various places without the issue you
describe.

you didn't mention which version of JACK you are using - the error
