&gt; Message-ID:&lt;[hidden]&gt;
&gt; Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've been unable to debug my jack app in gdb. Take the auto-server
&gt; case. Whenever gdb stops the program due to a signal (either ^C or a
&gt; segfault) an endless stream of
&gt;
&gt; subgraph starting at&lt;client&gt;  timed out (subgraph_wait_fd=14, status =
&gt; 0, state = Triggered, pollret = 0 revents = 0x0)
&gt;
&gt; gets printed, and I have to kill gdb from another shell.
&gt;
&gt; If I start the server from qjackctl, the same process crashes qjackctl.
&gt;
&gt; I've tried exiting the process thread on lost frames, but it doesn't help.
&gt;
&gt; I've seen reports of jackd and gdb on the net, so there has to be a
&gt; way. What could be the problem? I am of course not expecting to stop a
&gt; jack app and then continue, but at least I want to be able to see
&gt; backtraces, inspect variables etc in gdb.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dan

&gt; One way is to get core dumps from the app (ulimit -c unlimited) and
&gt; then gdb ./myapp core, and then in gdb: thread apply all bt.
&gt;
&gt; You can also use the dummy driver (instead of, for example Alsa) with
&gt; a long --timeout value to be able to step through the code.

&gt; This actually works out OK, thanks. I had forgotten about core dumps.
&gt; I guess I can add abort() as necessary.

&gt; But I wonder what is the problem that's preventing gdb from stopping?
&gt; And why does jack get stuck in a loop printing "subgraph timed out"?
&gt; Even a poorly-behaved client shouldn't crash jack, right?

&gt; i know that some people do seem to have problems using JACK and gdb.
&gt; but others (e.g. myself) never have (modulo the usual issues with not
&gt; running in RT mode and using a long timeout. i routinely run ardour
&gt; inside gdb a lot, and stop in various places without the issue you
&gt; describe.
&gt;
&gt; you didn't mention which version of JACK you are using - the error
&gt; message makes it sound like jack1, but which release?

&gt; Yes, jackd1 -- from Ubuntu Natty (1:0.118+svn4104-1ubuntu2); jackd
&gt; --version reports 0.120.1

&gt; Subject: [Jack-Devel] RFC: fix for missing port registration
&gt; 	notifications	when switching master
&gt; Message-ID:&lt;[hidden]&gt;
&gt; Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
&gt;
&gt; The issue was reported in #213 (second issue/patch):
&gt;
&gt; jackdbus' internal graph representation is not properly kept in sync
&gt; with the engine's graph. In particular: ports are not properly removed
&gt; &gt; From the connection list when a client goes away; and ports
&gt; re-appearing after a "switch-master" are not being updated (Patch
&gt; 2/2).
&gt;
&gt; I think the proposed patch is wrong because AFAIK graph reorder is only
&gt; for ports present upon client activation. All following port
&gt; (un)registrations must cause the port registration callback to be
&gt; called. The proposed changeset [1] adds notification calls in the
&gt; Attach()/Detach() methods. The changeset is commited to a dedicated
&gt; branch [2]. The branch is (hopefully) a short living one with a signle
&gt; commit, so it makes sense to commit it directly to svn trunk (after
&gt; eventually rebasing it, of the svn trunk moved).
&gt;
&gt; Robin, I'd be glad if you can test&amp;  report whether my fix works for
&gt; you.
