Hi Jack Devs,

I was just introduced to your OS Jack
project and I was really inspired by what
you guys are doing. I thinks its great
that you're liberating audio from outdated
software-specific limitations.

I work at TheDJHookup.com and my
boss likes to sponsor cool stuff in the
industry and I definitely think this would
be up his alley.

I'm just wondering if you guys accept
sponsorship (i.e. we donate x amount
of gear or money in exchange for an
unobtrusive "sponsored by..." link on
the site). If so, please let me know
what your terms are, because I think
quarterly budget for this kind of stuff
may be about up.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
