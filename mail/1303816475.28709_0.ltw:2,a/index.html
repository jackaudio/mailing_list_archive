&gt; Hi Jack Devs,
&gt;
&gt; I was just introduced to your OS Jack
&gt; project and I was really inspired by what
&gt; you guys are doing. I thinks its great
&gt; that you're liberating audio from outdated
&gt; software-specific limitations.
&gt; I work at TheDJHookup.com and my
&gt; boss likes to sponsor cool stuff in the
&gt; industry and I definitely think this would
&gt; be up his alley.
&gt; I'm just wondering if you guys accept
&gt; sponsorship (i.e. we donate x amount
&gt; of gear or money in exchange for an
&gt; unobtrusive "sponsored by..." link on
&gt; the site). If so, please let me know
&gt; what your terms are, because I think
&gt; quarterly budget for this kind of stuff
&gt; may be about up.

We prefer not to run advertising on the JACK website unless it comes
from companies who make technology clearly interlinked with what JACK
is all about. But it depends a bit on the amount of money. If its an
amount that would make it more likely that one of the (existing or
potential) JACK developers could put aside other work and do something
substantive, that policy would not apply.

Thanks for your interest and potential support of JACK.

Paul Davis
