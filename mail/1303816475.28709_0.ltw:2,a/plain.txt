We prefer not to run advertising on the JACK website unless it comes
from companies who make technology clearly interlinked with what JACK
is all about. But it depends a bit on the amount of money. If its an
amount that would make it more likely that one of the (existing or
potential) JACK developers could put aside other work and do something
substantive, that policy would not apply.

Thanks for your interest and potential support of JACK.
