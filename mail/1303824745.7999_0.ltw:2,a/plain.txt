Hi Stephane !
Thanks !

As audio concerned, 4340 worked & works OK, I'll install the new one and continue tests
Midi had noticeable latency on 4340, let's see what's goin' on with 4356.
On my earlier posts I said about not being able to control two different apps with the same keyboard, even with MidiYoke.
For this I used KorgSG1D 88 with Romio II usb/midi device.
Yesterday I did the following and worked OK :
64bit Jack 4340
Yamaha Motif ES-6 (updated and its USB driver too) straight USB out.
EWQL Symphonic Orchestra Free edition 64bit
EWQL Symphonic Choirs earlier version Kompakt 32bit with Word builder separate
MidiYoke(32bit) - Though LoopMidi(32/64bit) and LoopBe1(32/64bit) are on my system too.

Both EWQL saw jackrouter. SO loopbe1 and ES and Builder MidiYoke and ES.
The Midi connection was : ES to Builder, ES to Orch. Builder with Yoke to Kompakt.
Both EWQL audio (Orch, Kompakt) to jackrouter.

Ah.... it worked FINE ! Audio was super , didn't engaged Jack Control .
Midi, everything controlled from ES and NO latency (USB straight is better than converted from Midi ). But I didn't engaged the -X winmme.

I'll try the same test with Midi from Jack to see any improvement on my previous one.

Thank you all for your amazing efforts !

Best
Panos

Hi Windows users.

Updated installer for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4356) on Windows 64 and 32 bits is available:

1) Pure 32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_32_setup.exe

2) Mixed 64/32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_64_setup.exe

- SVN 4356 : possibly jitter improvements in WinMME driver (Devin Anderson)

The Jack v 1.9.8/64bits/JackRouter.dll still has to be registered "manually" with regsvr32

Be sure to uninstall previous version before installing the new one.

Testing and feedback welcome!
