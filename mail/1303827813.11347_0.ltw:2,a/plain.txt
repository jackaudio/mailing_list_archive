Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installers for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4356) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Hi again.

  

Just finnished an early test with 4356.

No need to register the 64bit dll.......... it worked just like that (??!)

I'll double check again.....

Is it possible that windows remember my previous register?

  

Just added after -d portaudio the -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2".

Also my previous desktop shortcut icons (4340) worked with 4356 as they were - no need to delete and create new ones. Good.

  

In my last registration there wasn't a JackRouter64.dll, but a JackRouter.dll in a 64bits folder. So registration was : 

  

regsvr32 C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll

  

This is a succesfull registration with Command Line.

  

I also saw that in Jack Audio connection kit setup the jackd was preset 
with portaudio at 128/48000 !! giving latency bellow 6ms (5.33) !!!!!!! better than anything I got here when on 128/48000(=6ms usually).

Stephane, this is raw power....

  

Tests continuum....

  

Best

Panos

Hi Stephane !
Thanks !

As audio concerned, 4340 worked & works OK, I'll install the new one and continue tests
Midi had noticeable latency on 4340, let's see what's goin' on with 4356.
On my earlier posts I said about not being able to control two different apps with the same keyboard, even with MidiYoke.
For this I used KorgSG1D 88 with Romio II usb/midi device.
Yesterday I did the following and worked OK :
64bit Jack 4340
Yamaha Motif ES-6 (updated and its USB driver too) straight USB out.
EWQL Symphonic Orchestra Free edition 64bit
EWQL Symphonic Choirs earlier version Kompakt 32bit with Word builder separate
MidiYoke(32bit) - Though LoopMidi(32/64bit) and LoopBe1(32/64bit) are on my system too.

Both EWQL saw jackrouter. SO loopbe1 and ES and Builder MidiYoke and ES.
The Midi connection was : ES to Builder,
 ES to Orch. Builder with Yoke to Kompakt.
Both EWQL audio (Orch, Kompakt) to jackrouter.

Ah.... it worked FINE ! Audio was super , didn't engaged Jack Control .
Midi, everything controlled from ES and NO latency (USB straight is better than converted from Midi ). But I didn't engaged the -X winmme.

I'll try the same test with Midi from Jack to see any improvement on my previous one.

Thank you all for your amazing efforts !

Best
Panos

Hi Windows users.

Updated installer for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4356) on Windows 64 and 32 bits is available:

1) Pure 32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_32_setup.exe

2) Mixed 64/32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_64_setup.exe

- SVN 4356 : possibly jitter improvements in WinMME driver (Devin Anderson)

The Jack v 1.9.8/64bits/JackRouter.dll still has to be registered "manually" with regsvr32

Be sure to uninstall previous version before installing the new one.

Testing and feedback welcome!
