Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Installers for Jack 1.9.8 (SVN 4356) for Windows 64 and 32 bits

Thanks Stephane !

A little add. 512 is more reasonable, yes, but on Windows with Asio4all, the majority of users need dual and/or 4core CPU and above 4GBram to play with modern digital/virtual instruments & Hosts, so I don't know anyone who still uses 512 for buffer size...
Many with XP still go for 256 as standard, but on modern win7 128 tends to be the main size.
Sample rate is another element to consideration of course as for example with the latest Kontakt 4.2.2 where I cannot select anything else than 512 but I can alter the sample rate up to 196.000 !!!!, so here a good setting is 512(standard) with 96.000 getting just above 6ms. So your point at 512 standard makes sence.

With Jackd at 128/48000 giving 5.33ms I'm best here, it has to be tested with more windows users to see.
Come on gentlemen , please, do some test !

best
Panos

Well this was not really wanted... the code to setup default parameter was rewritten. I guess a default value of 512 frames is more reasonable.
