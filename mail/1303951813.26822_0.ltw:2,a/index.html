The hardware platform I have now is based on an Altera Cyclone III running a
NIOS2 softcore with an older version of Linux and GCC.
The problem with the C++ compiler being broken for NIOS2 have been solved in
more recent version of GCC.
I am going to use this platform to do a proof of concept then I will
redesign a new hardware platform.
I am probably going to stay with Altera because I have a very good
relationship with them and I already have licenses for all their tools.
My current platform is a 100% in house design but the new one will probably
be based on an off the shelf module to reduce the cost and design time.
I am currently looking at a module called "Mercury CA1" from a company
called Enclustra. The module has a Cyclone IV FPGA, flash, DDR2 and Gigabit
Ethernet.
The plan will be to plug the module to an in house designed carrier board
with several Analog IN/OUT, mutliple ADAT and multiple TDM streams to
connect to a DSP, with a total number of channels up to 128 IN and 128 OUT.

&gt; Are you definitely set on Alterra?  The Xilinx Microblaze processor has
&gt; support in current gcc.
&gt; There was another project that wanted all open source designs, so ended up
&gt; using the Mico32 processor from Lattice, but implementing on either Xilinx
&gt; or Altera FPGA.  Pretty sure Mico32 is supported by gcc, but I don't see
&gt; it listed in the 4.6 documentation, so I'm not sure of the current status.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like a very interesting project, please keep everyone informed on
&gt; your progress.
