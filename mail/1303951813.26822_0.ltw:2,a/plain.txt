The hardware platform I have now is based on an Altera Cyclone III running a
NIOS2 softcore with an older version of Linux and GCC.
The problem with the C++ compiler being broken for NIOS2 have been solved in
more recent version of GCC.
I am going to use this platform to do a proof of concept then I will
redesign a new hardware platform.
I am probably going to stay with Altera because I have a very good
relationship with them and I already have licenses for all their tools.
My current platform is a 100% in house design but the new one will probably
be based on an off the shelf module to reduce the cost and design time.
I am currently looking at a module called "Mercury CA1" from a company
called Enclustra. The module has a Cyclone IV FPGA, flash, DDR2 and Gigabit
Ethernet.
The plan will be to plug the module to an in house designed carrier board
with several Analog IN/OUT, mutliple ADAT and multiple TDM streams to
connect to a DSP, with a total number of channels up to 128 IN and 128 OUT.
