Hi,

On Thursday 28 April 2011 07:28:27 Timothy Godfrey wrote:
&gt; The jack_ringbuffer_t documentation says
&gt; 
&gt; "The key attribute of a ringbuffer is that it can be safely accessed
&gt; by two threads simultaneously -- one reading from the buffer and the
&gt; other writing to it -- without using any synchronization or mutual
&gt; exclusion primitives. For this to work correctly, there can only be a
&gt; single reader and a single writer thread. Their identities cannot be
&gt; interchanged. "
&gt; 
&gt; What are the specifics of these conditions? I am writing to the
&gt; ringbuffer in the process() callback of my application, and I am
&gt; reading from the ringbuffer in the main loop. Does this count as being
&gt; in different threads?

As the process()-callback is executed within the audio-thread jack creates for 
you inside your application, this counts as two different threads. And its 
exactly what the ringbuffer is created for.

&gt; For testing/education purposes, does it work to read and write to the
&gt; ringbuffer from within a single thread (to check that data went in
&gt; correctly, for example), without any other threads involved?

That is also possible. The things that don't work with a lock-free ringbuffer 
like the one in jack:
 - Multiple writers in several threads writing to the same ringbuffer.
 - Multiple readers in several threads reading from the same ringbuffer.

&gt; Would
&gt; constitute a violation of the rule, 'Their identities cannot be
&gt; interchanged'?

This rule is there because when one thread is the reader and then another 
thread starts reading, there is a chance that for a short time both threads 
read. And that is not safe without locks on the ringbuffer or somewhere else. 
(Same for writers.)

&gt; Will I run into trouble if I am mixing a c++ (jack2?) application with
&gt; a jack1 server?

That shouldn't give you any trouble...

Have fun,

Arnold
