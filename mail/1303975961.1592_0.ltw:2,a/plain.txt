Subject:     [Jack-Devel] rtprio troubles

Hello,
I am trying to run Jack (and utilities that use Jack) on a fresh install of LinuxMint LXDE Julia using the generic Linux kernel.
I installed Jack2, enabled realtime priority scheduling upon installation, modified my audio.conf as directed, added my login name to the audio group, etc but can't seem to get Jack to start as a real time process. For example, whenever I try to start it in realtime using jackd -R -d alsa, I get the following error message:
Cannot use real-time scheduling (RR/10)(1: Operation not permitted)
However, if I start using the same options with sudo, it will work just fine. 
Upon further inspection with ulimit -l -r command I get this:
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64real-time priority              (-r) 0
After entering command groups:
dylan adm dialout cdrom audio plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare
.. and just for reference,  output of command cat /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf:
# Provided by the jackd package.## Changes to this file will be preserved.## If you want to enable/disable realtime permissions, run##    dpkg-reconfigure -p high jackd
@audio   -  rtprio     95@audio   -  memlock    unlimited#@audio   -  nice      -19
I also tried adding the above lines to limits.conf, but to no avail... also tried changing group of jackd to audio, but that didn't work either. Any other ideas??
So far the only way I can get scel to work is by running terminal and running sudo emacs -sclang, which is rather annoying.
Best,Dylan
