&gt; &gt; This rule is there because when one thread is the reader and then another
&gt; &gt; thread starts reading, there is a chance that for a short time both
&gt; &gt; threads read. And that is not safe
&gt; Not even reading by two threads is safe? Why is that?
&gt; Do you mean 'getting' (removal) from the buffer? That makes sense.

"Reading" from ringbuffers seems to be widely accepted as "getting".

&gt; What about simple 'peek' operations (without removal), is that OK?

That can work, but it doesn't have to. What one thread sees while peeking is 
probably not the same it sees the next time it accesses the buffer if another 
thread is the real "reader" (the one who modifies the read-pointer).
Even worse: [thread A is the writer, thread B the reader, thread C the 
"peeker"]
 - Thread A writes something to the ringbuffer. Now the size is &gt; 0.
 - Thread C peeks and saves the pointer to the data it peeks at.
 - Thread B reads all available data from the buffer.
 - Thread A writes as much new data in the buffer as it can. The buffer is now 
filled with new data.
 - When Thread C accesses the memory from the peeking, the data in there is 
not what it was when it first peeked at it. There is even no guarantee that it 
now points to a valid "entry point" in the data stream. What was boundary of a 
double could now be in the middle of the bytes of a new double.

Simply put: Don't do that! Its not guaranteed to work.

&gt; &gt; without locks on the ringbuffer or somewhere
&gt; &gt; else. (Same for writers.)
&gt; 
&gt; MusE is using custom ring buffers.
&gt; (Admittedly I think we're breaking some of those rules in a few places.)
&gt; They have some code for atomization with locks, but it seems unused ATM.
&gt; I can turn it on, but I wonder if I should.
&gt; 
&gt; The ring buffers have a volatile size member.
&gt; What effect does the volatile keyword have, in general?
&gt; From the "Introduction to the Volatile Keyword" at Embedded dot com:
&gt; "A variable should be declared volatile whenever its value could change
&gt;  unexpectedly.  ...&lt;such as&gt; global variables within a multi-threaded
&gt;  application ...So all shared global variables should be declared
&gt; volatile."
&gt; I try to follow that rule, but I gather use of volatile may not be enough,
&gt;  that locks may be required in some cases?

The usage of 'volatile' prevents the compiler from optimizing the access to 
that variable. For example inside a loop you will see strange results when you 
access a variable that is changed from outside while the loop is running. 
Without 'volatile' some reads of that variable will not give what you expect 
as the compiler just makes the loop use the value from the last access. Or 
maybe even the value from before the loop started. (That behaviour even 
changes whether you enable debug compile or compile with optimizations.)
With volatile you tell the compiler to always access the variable.

However this is _no_ protection for ringbuffers (regardless whether they carry 
binary streams or messages) where there is more then one reader or more then 
one writer! This will not work without the usage of atomic locks.

But the size-member of ringbuffers is essentially useless, its only nice-to-
have. For writing to a ringbuffer, the size is only a first-order assumption how 
much data fits in (as reader-threads might read data while you write). What 
counts is the information "full" because you have to stop writing when the 
buffer is full.
For readers size is also only a first-order assumption as there might be new 
data written to the buffer while it reads. The only hard information here is 
"empty" when there is no data to read.
And the information "full" or "empty" is what you get from comparing the read- 
and write-pointers (doesn't matter whether these are real pointers, counting 
integers or iterators).
If the size-member is volatile this only prevents readers from reading to 
slow. But the real state information is in the pointers and these should 
therefor be volatile too. Or simply make the whole ringbuffer_t volatile...

Have fun,

Arnold
