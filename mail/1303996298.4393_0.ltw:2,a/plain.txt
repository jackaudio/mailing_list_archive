Hi Graham, Stephane and all
I got the same problem initialy with win7 64bit, but my error was that I was registering JackRouter64.dll and not 64bits\JackRouter.dll, then all OK.
At your XPx64 can you double click regsvr32 and run it as administrator?Here is not possible, all registrations done with command line from start menu.
My last 4356 installation was workin' out of the box (exept Asio) . Windows remembered my last registration it seems...

Hi Stéphane,

I created a completely new install of Windows XP 64-bit, then ran the
32/64-bit Jack Installer, then tried to register the 64-bit dll with

regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll"

And I get this error:

LoadLibrary("C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack
v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll") failed - The specified procedure could
not be found.

I then loaded Dependency Walker, and it found all the dependencies,
but is loading the 32-bit versions of kernel32.dll, users32.dll,
advapi32.dll, and ole32.dll from the c:\windows\syswow64 directory....
and not the 64-bit versions from system32.

Any ideas of what to try to get the 64-bit dll registered in WinXP 64-bit?

In Windows 7, I de-registered the dll, un-installed the last test
version, installed this version, and regsvr32 registered things just
fine. Jack works fine there too.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
