&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constitute a violation of the rule, 'Their identities cannot be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interchanged'?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This rule is there because when one thread is the reader and then
&gt; &gt; &gt; another thread starts reading, there is a chance that for a short time
&gt; &gt; &gt; both threads read. And that is not safe
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not even reading by two threads is safe? Why is that?
&gt; &gt; Do you mean 'getting' (removal) from the buffer? That makes sense.
&gt;
&gt; "Reading" from ringbuffers seems to be widely accepted as "getting".
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What about simple 'peek' operations (without removal), is that OK?
&gt;
&gt; That can work, but it doesn't have to. What one thread sees while peeking
&gt; is probably not the same it sees the next time it accesses the buffer if
&gt; another thread is the real "reader" (the one who modifies the
&gt; read-pointer). Even worse: [thread A is the writer, thread B the reader,
&gt; thread C the "peeker"]
&gt;  - Thread A writes something to the ringbuffer. Now the size is &gt; 0.
&gt;  - Thread C peeks and saves the pointer to the data it peeks at.
&gt;  - Thread B reads all available data from the buffer.
&gt;  - Thread A writes as much new data in the buffer as it can. The buffer is
&gt; now filled with new data.
&gt;  - When Thread C accesses the memory from the peeking, the data in there is
&gt; not what it was when it first peeked at it. There is even no guarantee that
&gt; it now points to a valid "entry point" in the data stream. What was
&gt; boundary of a double could now be in the middle of the bytes of a new
&gt; double.
&gt;
&gt; Simply put: Don't do that! Its not guaranteed to work.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; without locks on the ringbuffer or somewhere
&gt; &gt; &gt; else. (Same for writers.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MusE is using custom ring buffers.
&gt; &gt; (Admittedly I think we're breaking some of those rules in a few places.)
&gt; &gt; They have some code for atomization with locks, but it seems unused ATM.
&gt; &gt; I can turn it on, but I wonder if I should.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The ring buffers have a volatile size member.
&gt; &gt; What effect does the volatile keyword have, in general?
&gt; &gt; From the "Introduction to the Volatile Keyword" at Embedded dot com:
&gt; &gt; "A variable should be declared volatile whenever its value could change
&gt; &gt;  unexpectedly.  ...&lt;such as&gt; global variables within a multi-threaded
&gt; &gt;  application ...So all shared global variables should be declared
&gt; &gt; volatile."
&gt; &gt; I try to follow that rule, but I gather use of volatile may not be
&gt; &gt; enough, that locks may be required in some cases?
&gt;
&gt; The usage of 'volatile' prevents the compiler from optimizing the access to
&gt; that variable. For example inside a loop you will see strange results when
&gt; you access a variable that is changed from outside while the loop is
&gt; running. Without 'volatile' some reads of that variable will not give what
&gt; you expect as the compiler just makes the loop use the value from the last
&gt; access. Or maybe even the value from before the loop started. (That
&gt; behaviour even changes whether you enable debug compile or compile with
&gt; optimizations.) With volatile you tell the compiler to always access the
&gt; variable.
&gt;
&gt; However this is _no_ protection for ringbuffers (regardless whether they
&gt; carry binary streams or messages) where there is more then one reader or
&gt; more then one writer! This will not work without the usage of atomic locks.
&gt;
&gt; But the size-member of ringbuffers is essentially useless, its only
&gt; nice-to- have. For writing to a ringbuffer, the size is only a first-order
&gt; assumption how much data fits in (as reader-threads might read data while
&gt; you write). What counts is the information "full" because you have to stop
&gt; writing when the buffer is full.
&gt; For readers size is also only a first-order assumption as there might be
&gt; new data written to the buffer while it reads. The only hard information
&gt; here is "empty" when there is no data to read.
&gt; And the information "full" or "empty" is what you get from comparing the
&gt; read- and write-pointers (doesn't matter whether these are real pointers,
&gt; counting integers or iterators).
&gt; If the size-member is volatile this only prevents readers from reading to
&gt; slow. But the real state information is in the pointers and these should
&gt; therefor be volatile too. Or simply make the whole ringbuffer_t volatile...
&gt;
&gt; Have fun,
&gt;
&gt; Arnold

Also, I didn't consider multi-core cpus. That must change the game a bit.
(Looks at his P4 computer - "gotta upgrade!")  Thanks. OT-ish:

If one ever wonders what a ring buffer 'sounds' like, I love 'em for a different 
 reason - live T.D. pitch shifting. 
I think Ozzy uses one when he laughs like a baby at the end of Crazy Train.
That was 1980, a couple of years later I was doing that on 'home computers' 
 of the day. Shortly after that I saw Stevie Wonder use one live on a TV show, 
 so he could sing one of his childhood songs - as a child.
Maybe they were using analog filter banks and vocoders or tape tricks, but 
 you could hear that metallic-y sound which gave away this 'new' digital 
 technique. I just learned the other day in a ladspa plugins of a further 
 sinewave technique. (Dual-channel memory: Great for HW projects!)
