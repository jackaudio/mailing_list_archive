&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constitute a violation of the rule, 'Their identities cannot be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interchanged'?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This rule is there because when one thread is the reader and then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another thread starts reading, there is a chance that for a short
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time both threads read. And that is not safe
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not even reading by two threads is safe? Why is that?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you mean 'getting' (removal) from the buffer? That makes sense.
&gt; &gt; "Reading" from ringbuffers seems to be widely accepted as "getting".
&gt; &gt; &gt; What about simple 'peek' operations (without removal), is that OK?
&gt; &gt; That can work, but it doesn't have to. What one thread sees while peeking
&gt; &gt; is probably not the same it sees the next time it accesses the buffer if
&gt; &gt; another thread is the real "reader" (the one who modifies the
&gt; &gt; read-pointer). Even worse: [thread A is the writer, thread B the reader,
&gt; &gt; thread C the "peeker"]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - Thread A writes something to the ringbuffer. Now the size is &gt; 0.
&gt; &gt;  - Thread C peeks and saves the pointer to the data it peeks at.
&gt; &gt;  - Thread B reads all available data from the buffer.
&gt; &gt;  - Thread A writes as much new data in the buffer as it can. The buffer
&gt; &gt;  is
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; now filled with new data.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - When Thread C accesses the memory from the peeking, the data in there
&gt; &gt;  is
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; not what it was when it first peeked at it. There is even no guarantee
&gt; &gt; that it now points to a valid "entry point" in the data stream. What was
&gt; &gt; boundary of a double could now be in the middle of the bytes of a new
&gt; &gt; double.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Simply put: Don't do that! Its not guaranteed to work.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without locks on the ringbuffer or somewhere
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else. (Same for writers.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MusE is using custom ring buffers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Admittedly I think we're breaking some of those rules in a few
&gt; &gt; &gt; places.) They have some code for atomization with locks, but it seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; unused ATM. I can turn it on, but I wonder if I should.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The ring buffers have a volatile size member.
&gt; &gt; &gt; What effect does the volatile keyword have, in general?
&gt; &gt; &gt; From the "Introduction to the Volatile Keyword" at Embedded dot com:
&gt; &gt; &gt; "A variable should be declared volatile whenever its value could change
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  unexpectedly.  ...&lt;such as&gt; global variables within a multi-threaded
&gt; &gt; &gt;  application ...So all shared global variables should be declared
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; volatile."
&gt; &gt; &gt; I try to follow that rule, but I gather use of volatile may not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, that locks may be required in some cases?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The usage of 'volatile' prevents the compiler from optimizing the access
&gt; &gt; to that variable. For example inside a loop you will see strange results
&gt; &gt; when you access a variable that is changed from outside while the loop
&gt; &gt; is running. Without 'volatile' some reads of that variable will not give
&gt; &gt; what you expect as the compiler just makes the loop use the value from
&gt; &gt; the last access. Or maybe even the value from before the loop started.
&gt; &gt; (That behaviour even changes whether you enable debug compile or compile
&gt; &gt; with optimizations.) With volatile you tell the compiler to always
&gt; &gt; access the variable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However this is _no_ protection for ringbuffers (regardless whether they
&gt; &gt; carry binary streams or messages) where there is more then one reader or
&gt; &gt; more then one writer! This will not work without the usage of atomic
&gt; &gt; locks.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But the size-member of ringbuffers is essentially useless, its only
&gt; &gt; nice-to- have. For writing to a ringbuffer, the size is only a
&gt; &gt; first-order assumption how much data fits in (as reader-threads might
&gt; &gt; read data while you write). What counts is the information "full"
&gt; &gt; because you have to stop writing when the buffer is full.
&gt; &gt; For readers size is also only a first-order assumption as there might be
&gt; &gt; new data written to the buffer while it reads. The only hard information
&gt; &gt; here is "empty" when there is no data to read.
&gt; &gt; And the information "full" or "empty" is what you get from comparing the
&gt; &gt; read- and write-pointers (doesn't matter whether these are real pointers,
&gt; &gt; counting integers or iterators).
&gt; &gt; If the size-member is volatile this only prevents readers from reading to
&gt; &gt; slow. But the real state information is in the pointers and these should
&gt; &gt; therefor be volatile too. Or simply make the whole ringbuffer_t
&gt; &gt; volatile...
&gt; Also, I didn't consider multi-core cpus. That must change the game a bit.
&gt; (Looks at his P4 computer - "gotta upgrade!")  Thanks. OT-ish:

Hehe, my desktop at home is an old P4 too. And I gotta upgrade once I have 
time to decide what I want...

But multiple cores isn't the only thing that triggers the behaviour I sketched 
above, normal process-scheduling can do the same on a single-core system.
Heck, I learned the most about ringbuffers when I implemented my own to send 
and receive serial streams on a atmega8. Once you realize that its nice to 
append the data to the buffer within the receiving interrupt, you also realize 
that this can happen anytime while your main-thread works on the buffer. And 
then you love it when your ringbuffer works without locks, otherwise you risk 
loosing the received data.
The same for ringbuffers in audio, once you use locks inside the process()-
callback, you are f***ed...

Have fun,

Arnold
