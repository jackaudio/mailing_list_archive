Hehe, my desktop at home is an old P4 too. And I gotta upgrade once I have 
time to decide what I want...

But multiple cores isn't the only thing that triggers the behaviour I sketched 
above, normal process-scheduling can do the same on a single-core system.
Heck, I learned the most about ringbuffers when I implemented my own to send 
and receive serial streams on a atmega8. Once you realize that its nice to 
append the data to the buffer within the receiving interrupt, you also realize 
that this can happen anytime while your main-thread works on the buffer. And 
then you love it when your ringbuffer works without locks, otherwise you risk 
loosing the received data.
The same for ringbuffers in audio, once you use locks inside the process()-
callback, you are f***ed...

Have fun,

Arnold
