read the API docs:

  jack_port_by_id (jack_client_t*, jack_port_id_t);
  jack_port_by_name (jack_client_t*, const char* name);

threads for callbacks are one of the only areas where Jack1 and Jack2
appear different from a client perspective. they also differ between
OS X, Windows and other systems on which JACK runs. the following is a
table that i believe is correct:

1) Process Callback: ALWAYS called from the "process thread". There
may or may not be an "Other" thread running.

2) Other Server->Client Callbacks

                 OS X    Windows    *nix
----------------------------------------------
JACK1   |   Other     n/a            Process
JACK2   |   Oher      Other        Other


Finally, you should probably never make client->server calls from the
process callback. The API is not clearly marked with indications of
which functions involve client->server roundtrips. The best rule of
thumb is that functions involving a jack_client_t* argument are not
usable from within the process callback. This issue may go away
if/when Jack1 moves to an "always use 2 threads" model, but the
programming discipline that the rule provides is a good one. There is
some documentation on this within the refmanual.
