libjack is responsible for creating at least one thread to run the
process callback or the thread function used by the async API.

in JACK1, this is the only thread created by libjack, and all
server->client callbacks are executed there.

in JACK2, or in JACK1 on OS X, there are 2 threads: 1 handles process
callbacks, the other handles all other server->client callbacks.

there is no process callback when using the async API, so these are
not exceptions.
