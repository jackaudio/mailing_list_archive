Not really.  I don't have a Windows machine. :(  I assume that a
semaphore isn't signaling correctly.

&gt; Anyway, here are the latest results. &#xA0;It's a bit of a mixed bag compared with
&gt; the earlier test (4340 version). &#xA0;Average latency is down, average jitter is
&gt; up. &#xA0;My AudioFire4 is the only device on my Firewire bus and it's using the
&gt; latest Windows 7 Echo Audio driver.

Can you run JACK in verbose mode and send me the output of JACK?  I've
inserted debugging code around the MIDI output timer calls so that I
can figure out if the timer is the source of the jitter on Windows.

What I find most interesting is that this result:

&gt; Reported out-port latency: 11.61-12.63 ms (512-557 frames)
&gt; Reported in-port latency: 11.61-12.63 ms (512-557 frames)
&gt; Average latency: 45.98 ms (2028.04 frames)
&gt; Lowest latency: 32.13 ms (1417 frames)
&gt; Highest latency: 61.53 ms (2714 frames)
&gt; Peak MIDI jitter: 29.41 ms (1297 frames)
&gt; Average MIDI jitter: 6.10 ms (268.63 frames)

... and this result:

&gt;&gt; Reported out-port latency: 2.67-3.67 ms (128-176 frames)
&gt;&gt; Reported in-port latency: 2.67-3.67 ms (128-176 frames)
&gt;&gt; Average latency: 43.34 ms (2080.89 frames)
&gt;&gt; Lowest latency: 30.98 ms (1528 frames)
&gt;&gt; Highest latency: 68.25 ms (3195 frames)
&gt;&gt; Peak MIDI jitter: 37.27 ms (1667 frames)
&gt;&gt; Average MIDI jitter: 3.81 ms (166.13 frames)

... have similar latency and jitter values, but have completely
different reported in-port and out-port latency values, meaning that
you ran JACK with two different period-size/period-count/sample-rate
combinations, and yet the MIDI latency was still about the same, which
means there's something that's not changing with regards to latency.
I can think of a few possibilities:

1.) The timer code could be erroneous.  If I can see the JACK output
in verbose mode, then I can take steps in figuring out if this is the
problem.

2.) The timer resolution could be off.  The code attempts to set the
timer resolution to the lowest possible available resolution, but
Windows is not very good at doing things in realtime.  One possible
solution to this problem would be to explicitly set the process
priority.  I've talked a bit with St&#xE9;phane about this.  Seeing the
output of JACK in verbose mode will help me figure out if this is the
problem.

If this is the problem, then I can investigate the usage of other
Windows timing mechanisms.  Windows has a lot of different timers, but
it's not always clear which timers work well and which ones don't.
Right now, the code uses a "waitable timer", but it could use a queue
timer.  The multimedia timers are marked as obsolete for whatever
reason, though a lot of multimedia code still appears to use them.

3.) The offset I'm computing for received MIDI events could be off.
The WinMME library has this weird convention whereby it resets a
millisecond counter to 0 somewhere inside 'midiInStart', and all
received MIDI events then have a timestamp computed, which is
basically a millisecond offset to the time that the millisecond
counter was reset.  Unfortunately, there's no way to figure out what
the absolute time was when the counter was reset in 'midiInStart',
what the counter is at any time, and how much time passes between the
time that the driver "timestamps" the MIDI event, and the time that
the MIDI in callback is called with the message itself.  It's *very*
frustrating.

I've seen a few different schemes that attempt to solve this problem.
The scheme I'm using increases latency a bit, but *should* cause 0
jitter, which I think is more important than a bit of latency.

4.) The timing of the WinMME driver could be off.  This is the
worst-case scenario, as there's absolutely nothing that can be done
about this.

Anyway, if you (or anyone reading this) could send me the verbose
output, then I can get started on figuring out the problem.

Thank you for all of your help thus far.  I appreciate it a lot. :)
