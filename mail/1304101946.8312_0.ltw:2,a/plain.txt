Hm... I only use port_get_buffer() from the process routine.

From my experiments and looking at the source, even in the async
model, the user-specified process_thread is only called once
activation is finished (perhaps this should be documented BTW).

So what you describe should not be possible. Yet I did have some
segfaults right in port_get_buffer(), which went away when I
synchronized on port connection. I can't reproduce them anymore. I
will try some more experiments...
