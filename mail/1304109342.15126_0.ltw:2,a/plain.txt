If I may break in here... Overheating usually means dust build-up 
 between the fan and the radiator.
Best scenario: Disassemble the laptop and remove all the dust.
Next best: No disassemble? Use a can of compressed air and blow 
 into the exhaust vents - outdoors and away from face.
Some laptops are so dirty they have a 'carpet' layer of dust, between 
 the fan and the radiator, so thick you could walk on it. Thus no air 
 circulation at all! Disassembly is best there.
Do this soon because and save some grief because certain brands of laptops'
 video chipset bonding goes bad because of the overheating, besides other
 usual things which can go wrong.
A certain two-letter brand requires a bios update to scale the speed and 
 control the fan better.

Tim.
