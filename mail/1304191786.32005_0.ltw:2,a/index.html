Hi Devin,

http://dino.drealm.info/peter/jacklogs.7z contains:
jack-128-latency.log	- latency test for jackd run with -p 128
jackd-128.log		- jackd log for above
jack-latency.log	- latency test for jackd run without -p 128
jackd.log		- jackd log for above

Hope that's some help!

Cheers,

-- Peter

&gt;&gt; I tried using the alias names (e.g. "winmme:AudioFire4 MIDI:in2") and QJackCtl
&gt;&gt; showed the latency tester connecting to the ports.  However, it refused to run
&gt;&gt; the test, just sitting at "Waiting for connections ..." until I hit Ctrl-C.
&gt;&gt; Any ideas on that?
&gt; 
&gt; Not really.  I don't have a Windows machine. :(  I assume that a
&gt; semaphore isn't signaling correctly.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyway, here are the latest results.  It's a bit of a mixed bag compared with
&gt;&gt; the earlier test (4340 version).  Average latency is down, average jitter is
&gt;&gt; up.  My AudioFire4 is the only device on my Firewire bus and it's using the
&gt;&gt; latest Windows 7 Echo Audio driver.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you run JACK in verbose mode and send me the output of JACK?  I've
&gt; inserted debugging code around the MIDI output timer calls so that I
&gt; can figure out if the timer is the source of the jitter on Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find most interesting is that this result:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Reported out-port latency: 11.61-12.63 ms (512-557 frames)
&gt;&gt; Reported in-port latency: 11.61-12.63 ms (512-557 frames)
&gt;&gt; Average latency: 45.98 ms (2028.04 frames)
&gt;&gt; Lowest latency: 32.13 ms (1417 frames)
&gt;&gt; Highest latency: 61.53 ms (2714 frames)
&gt;&gt; Peak MIDI jitter: 29.41 ms (1297 frames)
&gt;&gt; Average MIDI jitter: 6.10 ms (268.63 frames)
&gt; 
&gt; ... and this result:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Reported out-port latency: 2.67-3.67 ms (128-176 frames)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Reported in-port latency: 2.67-3.67 ms (128-176 frames)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Average latency: 43.34 ms (2080.89 frames)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lowest latency: 30.98 ms (1528 frames)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Highest latency: 68.25 ms (3195 frames)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Peak MIDI jitter: 37.27 ms (1667 frames)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Average MIDI jitter: 3.81 ms (166.13 frames)
&gt; 
&gt; ... have similar latency and jitter values, but have completely
&gt; different reported in-port and out-port latency values, meaning that
&gt; you ran JACK with two different period-size/period-count/sample-rate
&gt; combinations, and yet the MIDI latency was still about the same, which
&gt; means there's something that's not changing with regards to latency.
&gt; I can think of a few possibilities:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.) The timer code could be erroneous.  If I can see the JACK output
&gt; in verbose mode, then I can take steps in figuring out if this is the
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.) The timer resolution could be off.  The code attempts to set the
&gt; timer resolution to the lowest possible available resolution, but
&gt; Windows is not very good at doing things in realtime.  One possible
&gt; solution to this problem would be to explicitly set the process
&gt; priority.  I've talked a bit with St&#xE9;phane about this.  Seeing the
&gt; output of JACK in verbose mode will help me figure out if this is the
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the problem, then I can investigate the usage of other
&gt; Windows timing mechanisms.  Windows has a lot of different timers, but
&gt; it's not always clear which timers work well and which ones don't.
&gt; Right now, the code uses a "waitable timer", but it could use a queue
&gt; timer.  The multimedia timers are marked as obsolete for whatever
&gt; reason, though a lot of multimedia code still appears to use them.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.) The offset I'm computing for received MIDI events could be off.
&gt; The WinMME library has this weird convention whereby it resets a
&gt; millisecond counter to 0 somewhere inside 'midiInStart', and all
&gt; received MIDI events then have a timestamp computed, which is
&gt; basically a millisecond offset to the time that the millisecond
&gt; counter was reset.  Unfortunately, there's no way to figure out what
&gt; the absolute time was when the counter was reset in 'midiInStart',
&gt; what the counter is at any time, and how much time passes between the
&gt; time that the driver "timestamps" the MIDI event, and the time that
&gt; the MIDI in callback is called with the message itself.  It's *very*
&gt; frustrating.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen a few different schemes that attempt to solve this problem.
&gt; The scheme I'm using increases latency a bit, but *should* cause 0
&gt; jitter, which I think is more important than a bit of latency.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.) The timing of the WinMME driver could be off.  This is the
&gt; worst-case scenario, as there's absolutely nothing that can be done
&gt; about this.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, if you (or anyone reading this) could send me the verbose
&gt; output, then I can get started on figuring out the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for all of your help thus far.  I appreciate it a lot. :)
