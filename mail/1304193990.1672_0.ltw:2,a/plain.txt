Thank you. :)

Interesting.  Both tests show that the timer wakes up within 1
millisecond of the ideal send time (sometimes early, sometimes late),
which means the timer code is introducing, at most, 2 milliseconds
peak jitter.  I can probably get that down to 1 millisecond of peak
jitter by introducing a second wait of 1 millisecond when the timer
wakes up early, but I don't think I can do better than that without
hackish busy-waiting due to Windows limitations on wakeup resolution.

That leaves incoming MIDI timestamp offsets and the MIDI device driver
as potential issues that I can see.

I'm going to take a look at the MIDI input handling code, and see if I
can find any problems.  If not, then I'll add debug statements that
will be output in verbose mode.  I would really appreciate another
test at that time if you're still willing to help. :)
