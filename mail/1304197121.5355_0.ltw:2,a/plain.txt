i recall sometime around 2000 reading some stuff in various electronic
music magazines about new timers in windows designed to get around
this, but then in 2001 steinberg and other companies came out with
dedicated hardware designed to "work around the limitations of the
windows timing system forever" (that hardware is long gone and windows
timing is still with us, naturally). i would have though that with the
HPET having been around for at least 7 or 8 years now, windows would
have found some way to export a better resolution timed wakeup, but
