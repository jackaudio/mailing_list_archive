Although I wrote the WinMME driver, I don't actually have a Windows
machine, so I don't really know what JACK apps run on Windows.  I
would guess that QJackCtl runs on Windows because Qt has Windows
bindings, but I'm not really sure.

If you're running JACK from the command line, then you just need to
add the '-v' switch to the command line when you start JACK.  The
output you see in the console is the output that I need to see.

If you're running JACK using QJackCtl, then you can probably do the following:

1.) Click on the 'Setup' button.
2.) Check the 'Verbose messages' checkbox.

When you run JACK, you can see its output in QJackCtl with the
'Messages' button.

You can cut and paste the output and send it to me.  Please *don't*
paste the output in a message to the mailing list, as that'll make a
lot of people unhappy.

I've already added debug code to MIDI input messages as well, but that
won't be merged until St√©phane has a chance to merge it.  At that
time, I'd love to see JACK output so I can continue to try to figure
out what's going on.

Thanks for all your help!
