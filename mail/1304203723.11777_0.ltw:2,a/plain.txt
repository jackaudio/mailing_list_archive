Devin and Peter,Thank you for your efforts ! I'm reading your posts with much interest !As I couldn't so far test the same things, I'm getting info on how to proceed too here.There's only Asio4All driver here, no external card and MME of course. Laptop PC win7 64bit dual core Intel 2.2GHz 4GBram.I'll see what I can do, to find some spare time to test too.....

Thank you. :)

Interesting.  Both tests show that the timer wakes up within 1
millisecond of the ideal send time (sometimes early, sometimes late),
which means the timer code is introducing, at most, 2 milliseconds
peak jitter.  I can probably get that down to 1 millisecond of peak
jitter by introducing a second wait of 1 millisecond when the timer
wakes up early, but I don't think I can do better than that without
hackish busy-waiting due to Windows limitations on wakeup resolution.

That leaves incoming MIDI timestamp offsets and the MIDI device driver
as potential issues that I can see.

I'm going to take a look at the MIDI input handling code, and see if I
can find any problems.  If not, then I'll add debug statements that
will be output in verbose mode.  I would really appreciate another
test at that time if you're still willing to help. :)
