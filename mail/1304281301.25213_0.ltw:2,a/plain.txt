Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack threads

hi all,

i just saw, that jack2 launches 3 different threads inside my client. 
especially, if i register a JackThreadInitCallback, this callback is called 
three times, not only once, as it is documented. is this a bug or are the docs 
not up to date?

thanks, tim
