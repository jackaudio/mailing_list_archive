Hi,

Thanks to Arnlod and Stephane for their replies to my last question
about the jack_ringbuffer_t. The good news is that my application now
works some of the time using the ringbuffers.

My challenge at the moment is that my application suddenly 'breaks'
after what appears to me to be a random amount of time. The symptoms
of breaking are that the application suddenly changes from playing
back audio to playing (something close to, but probably not strictly)
white noise.

A bit of background is probably in order to describe my problem. I am
working on transmitting audio streams reliably and with minimum
latency over a wireless network. I have heard of and read a bit about
netjack1 and netjack2 (and I have used them a little bit). I haven't
investigated thoroughly the possibility of modifying them or
contributing to them so that they work well over wireless networks. So
this is my signal flow from one end to another;

jack_port_t -&gt; ringbuffer -&gt; application layer network payload |
network link | application layer network payload -&gt; ringbuffer -&gt;
jack_port-t -&gt; loudspeakers

For testing I am playing back a variety of audio through pulseaudio
jack sinks into one side of my application, across the network and
into the other side of my application, and into the jack instance
running on that side.

As far as I can tell I have narrowed the problem down to the first
arrow in the signal flow above: getting audio out of the jack port and
into the ring buffer. To test this, I have created a couple of
'loopback' ports in the transmit side of my application, and I am
copying audio into those ports from two different 'places'. Here is
the chunk of code, from my process() callback, that does this (BPS is
'bytes per sample' and is defined in a header file as 4) :

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
	input[i] = (jack_default_audio_sample_t*)jack_port_get_buffer(input_port[i],
nframes);
	jack_ringbuffer_write(rb[i], (char*)input[i], nframes * BPS);
}


//put a copy of the left channel of audio onto a loopback port
memcpy(loopback1, input[0], nframes * BPS);

//read back the audio data from the ringbuffer and put it onto another
loopback port
jack_ringbuffer_get_read_vector(rb[0], readVector);
memcpy(loopback2, readVector[0].buf, readVector[0].len);
memcpy(loopback2 + readVector[0].len, readVector[1].buf, readVector[1].len);


So I am copying audio out of one of the ports into the ringbuffer,
also copying that audio directly to an output port, and then copying
the audio out of the ringbuffer into a another output port. (As an
aside, I couldn't get the peek function to work well, and even with
the method I am using as shown above the audio is a bit crap. The
audio is still good enough though to indicate when the application
breaks). When the application breaks The audio out of loopback1 keeps
playing perfectly, and the audio out of loopback 2 turns into white
noise. The white noise starts and stops with playback, and if I am
listening to a low level signal (like something a friend gave me that
is un-mastered), I can hear the rhythm and dynamics a bit in the quiet
sections of the audio. These things put together lead me to believe
that I am getting a sample 'alignment' problem. A shift one byte in
one direction would amplify the audio by 256 (2^8). A shift one byte
in the other direction would make the LSB from the previous sample the
MSB of the sample I am reading. Catastrophe and disaster, in either
case.

As I understand it, the ringbuffer works with bytes, and the buffer
pointers and count values all refer to bytes (char*). In some parts of
my application I have observed 'mysterious' behavior from the
ringbuffer like

if(jack_ringbuffer_get_read_space(rb) &gt; nframes){
   int bytesRead = jack_ringbuffer_read(rb, somePort, nframes);
   print("bytesRead: %d\n", bytesRead);
}

and getting "bytesRead: 100" printed out. I put this down to the whole
lockless phenomenon and details of execution outside the area of my
observation. These curtailed buffer copies don't seem to be correlated
with any audible glitches, and they don't appear to break the
application in the way I have described, so I am not entirely sure
what is going on there. But this leads me to wonder if there might be
a situation in which a write or read command to a ringbuffer reads or
writes a number of bytes that doesn't happen to fall on a sample
boundary.

So my question is, if I am using jack_default_audio_sample_t as the
content in a ringbuffer, how can I ensure the integrity of the samples
that span multiple bytes? Or rephrased, how can I make sure that the
write_ptr and read_ptr are always point to the start of samples (with
respect to each other), and ideally point to memory that is a multiple
of 4? What is the best way of checking that the buffer is empty enough
(for a write) or full enough (for a read): using the get_read_space
and get_write_space functions or by get_read_vector and
get_write_vector? (I am guessing that internally they probably do the
same thing, but seeing as things are not working the way I would
expect, I am happy to 'cast the net wide'.)

As an aside, would this situation be helped by creating a
parameterized ringbuffer, something like
jack_ringbuffer_t&lt;jack_default_audio_sample_t&gt;?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks for your time!
Tim
