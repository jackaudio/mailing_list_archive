this isn't an option and it isn't the current purpose of the callback.
it was created to handle systems where any thread might need to be
"registered" or have some setup done with it before it can run its
normal work function. there's no model of identifying the thread in
any way. i think this would be a mistake too, because it would mean
that if thread semantics changed in the future, your code would likely
break (imagine a future in which libjack initiates N "realtime"
threads and not just 1, for example).
