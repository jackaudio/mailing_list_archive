Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack2 on OSX Snow Leopard

Hello,

I would like to use Jack2 on OSX and in particular the audio over  
network function. Jacknet2 it is.

I downloaded the binary and it says the feature it for now disabled.

Questions:

1) When would the updated be possibly available?



2) I downloaded the source for 1.9.7 and found Jackdmp.xcodeproj  
within the macosx folder. I have xcode installed but not sure how to  
compile/develop this from here. Any instructions?

Thanks,
Thomas Czerny
