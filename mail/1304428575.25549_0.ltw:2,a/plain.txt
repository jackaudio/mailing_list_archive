Hi Dan,

As you are using MIDI Yoke I assume that you are using the 32-bit
Tester Install version of Jack for Windows.

I am also assuming that you are connecting the output audio from
Traktor 2 into Ableton live 8.

There are a few things that can be tweaked when starting the
JackPortAudio server that can make a big difference to latency and
stability of the audio stream. What settings are you using when
starting the Jack Portaudio server? What ASIO device is configured?
Are you configuring the Period size? :)

What are the symptoms of it going wrong?

Kind regards,
GrahamG
