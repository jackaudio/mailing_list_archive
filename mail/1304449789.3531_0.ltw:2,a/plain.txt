Hi,

Another problem with 1.9.8 but I don't know at what point it arose.

With 1.9.7, I can use netadaptor on Windows and the net driver on Linux to
connect two boxes:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.7>jackd -R -P 91 -S -X winmme -d portaudio
-d"ASIO::ASIO Echo FireWire" -r 48000 -p 64

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.7>jack_load netmanager
Starting Jack Network Manager.
Listening on '225.3.19.154:19000'
Waiting for a slave...

peter@dino:~/Source/wineasio/wineasio$ jackd -R -P 91 -S -d net
Sending parameters to dino ...
New NetMaster started.
**************** Network parameters ****************
Name : dino

etc.

In 1.9.8, it just "doesn't work".  I get the "Listening on
'225.3.19.154:19000'" message but no "Waiting for a slave..." after loading
netmanager.

When I try to connect from the Linux box, I get this on the Windows box:
Error : slave dino is running with a different protocol 1 != 2
Can't init new net master...
Waiting for a slave...

The linux box is running jackdmp 1.9.7 from 1.9.7~svn4067-1~frasten0 on Ubuntu
maverick.

Did the 'net' implementation change from 1.9.7 to 1.9.8?  I have some vague
memory that it might have.  Andrea Piccinelli doesn't appear to have updated
his PPA to 1.9.8, unfortunately.

If someone can confirm that the "1 != 2" indeed means I'll have to wait for
1.9.8 to make it to my Linux box, I'll relax and wait... :)

Thanks,

-- Peter

It can be activated in JACK server by using priorities over 90 like for instance: jackd -S -P 95 -d portaudio (or by adding "-P 95" in QjackCtl setup). When available this API is used in all RT threads, the backend (portaudio, net or dummy) one, MIDI backend (WinMME) and clients RT thread. It should be particularly useful when the JACK server is running with ASIO and small buffer sizes (like 64 frames).
