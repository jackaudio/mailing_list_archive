Subject:     [Jack-Devel] C++ development of Jack enabled applications--particularly SysExec

I originally posted these questions on the PlanetCCRMA list and it was
suggested to me that I should post it on the Jack-devel list by Devin
Anderson who has a similar interest in SysExec as I do and has written the
proposal for MIDI API Extensions.

I have lately taken on the C++-learning curve to do some programming with
Jack. If I keep having the free time I've had, another week should see me on
the down slop. I've started looking at the Jack API and the example code one
can find on Jack's site and Wiki. Three issues have already confronted me
that I'd like some thoughts on now as a newbee with the Jack API. Is this
where people tell me to ask over there? :-)

Firstly, since I am hoping to develop editor/librarians for external
hardware that will only be sending and receiving MIDI CCs and sysexec data,
Is incorporating the Jack API my only option or can I do something easier
with just ALSA and Jack will see it anyway? I read on the Jack Wiki that
Jack doesn't handle sysexec data very well and there is even a proposal to
give this some attention. *http://tinyurl.com/midi-sysexec-proposal *I want
to be able to use these applications while I have Jack running and I have
found you can't use the alsa utilities, if you are running Jack. Since
in QjackCtl
under the Connections everything, other than audio signals, are under the
ALSA tab anymore, has everyone dropped using Jack midi ports and Jack is
making midi connections with ALSA. What is that or the difference of those?
:-)

Secondly, I want to do this in C++ because I already have OOP in my brain
and I have run into some wiki discussions about needing to use a wrapper for
the best results. Considering my first question, what's the common trend on
that?

Lastly, since Jack has some issues with sysexec information, has anyone had
good luck with Jack and sysexec messages? I do send small sysexec messages,
say for one or two parameter changes, without a problem in Rosegarden, but
large amounts of data doesn't work so well.

Regards,

Sean
