ALSA midi still exists, its used by some apps, but JACK midi is preferred
for JACK-Capable apps, as the MIDI stays sample accurate with the Audio
stream. When using ALSA for MIDI & Jack for audio this is not the case. Most
newely released MIDI programs will support JACK midi.

I just use the standard  jack.h  c header, and wrote my own class around
that... there is a "jackmm" file up on sourceforge, I belive it works but
have no experience. Most of the docs online refer to the C API, so I'd stick
with that one to have a reference to look at.. Your choice though!

Currently JACK doesn't support large sys-ex messages. (Correct me if im
wrong JACK-devs..) but I think the reason is to do with the size of the MIDI
buffer that JACK uses. It wouldn't make sense to make it an arbitrary
"large" size, as one could technically over-flow the buffer. So at the
moment (again I'm not the most experienced) but I belive that JACK MIDI uses
a buffer that holds the standard "3 part" midi message, (ie: a bufffer that
contains 3 char's.)

Finally, you've set quite a high goal for yourself with the editors, I
personally wouldn't be up for a project so large as my first.. But if you
have program design experience & whatnot, don't let me discourage you!
Cheers, -Harry
