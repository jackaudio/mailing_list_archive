Thank you for the reply, Harry.

&gt;&gt; Since in c under the Connections everything, other than audio signals,
&gt;&gt; are under the ALSA tab anymore, has everyone dropped using Jack midi ports
&gt;&gt; and Jack is making midi connections with ALSA. What is that or the
&gt;&gt; difference of those? :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ALSA midi still exists, its used by some apps, but JACK midi is preferred
&gt; for JACK-Capable apps, as the MIDI stays sample accurate with the Audio
&gt; stream. When using ALSA for MIDI &amp; Jack for audio this is not the case. Most
&gt; newely released MIDI programs will support JACK midi.
&gt;


So, is my understanding correct that in the Connections window of QjackCtl
the MIDI tab is Jack MIDI and the ALSA tab has ALSA midi ports?


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Secondly, I want to do this in C++ because I already have OOP in my brain
&gt;&gt; and I have run into some wiki discussions about needing to use a wrapper for
&gt;&gt; the best results. Considering my first question, what's the common trend on
&gt;&gt; that?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I just use the standard  jack.h  c header, and wrote my own class around
&gt; that... there is a "jackmm" file up on sourceforge, I belive it works but
&gt; have no experience. Most of the docs online refer to the C API, so I'd stick
&gt; with that one to have a reference to look at.. Your choice though!
&gt;

You gave a lot of signposts to look for. It`s encouraging to hear you have
good results wrapping the C API and I won't sweat having to someone else's.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Lastly, since Jack has some issues with sysexec information, has anyone
&gt;&gt; had good luck with Jack and sysexec messages? I do send small sysexec
&gt;&gt; messages, say for one or two parameter changes, without a problem in
&gt;&gt; Rosegarden, but large amounts of data doesn't work so well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Currently JACK doesn't support large sys-ex messages. (Correct me if im
&gt; wrong JACK-devs..) but I think the reason is to do with the size of the MIDI
&gt; buffer that JACK uses. It wouldn't make sense to make it an arbitrary
&gt; "large" size, as one could technically over-flow the buffer. So at the
&gt; moment (again I'm not the most experienced) but I belive that JACK MIDI uses
&gt; a buffer that holds the standard "3 part" midi message, (ie: a bufffer that
&gt; contains 3 char's.)
&gt;

What an editor would really only be doing is taking parameter changes from
software that has graphical representations of pots, sliders, on/off buttons
and the like and sending CC# changes, NRPNs(LSB and MSB) with a value, and
system exclusive messages(varying amounts of data sent in hexadecimal
numbers encapsulated in a start and end id) and just sending it over a MIDI
channel(through Jack) to and from the hardware. The question is whether Jack
can handle the larger sysexec messages. I know ALSA does fine with them
because I can use amidi to do a global or program system dump and it saves
the information without a problem, but I have never gotten amidi to work
over a port while Jack was also running. Depending on how fast hardware does
a data dump maybe Jack can handle passing on the data in it's 3 chars(how
many hex numbers is that?) to a program that can collect them together.
Basically the editors aren't so complicated. A librarian would just be a
program that sends and receives sysexec data dumps to store to disk, read
from disk and send to a device and maybe a nice interface to view a
synths/hardware's patches.


&gt;
&gt; Finally, you've set quite a high goal for yourself with the editors, I
&gt; personally wouldn't be up for a project so large as my first.. But if you
&gt; have program design experience &amp; whatnot, don't let me discourage you!
&gt; Cheers, -Harry
&gt;

Yeah, I do have a few years behind me developing database
applications(mainly java/c#). It's the understanding of the Jack API,
wxWidgets and learning C/C++(or relearning it after over 10 years of not
using it since my undergraduate days) that are the main hurdles.
