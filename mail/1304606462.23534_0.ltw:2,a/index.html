&gt; So, is my understanding correct that in the Connections window of QjackCtl

This is correct.

&gt;&gt; I just use the standard  jack.h  c header, and wrote my own class around
&gt;&gt; that... there is a "jackmm" file up on sourceforge, I belive it works but
&gt;&gt; have no experience. Most of the docs online refer to the C API, so I'd stick
&gt;&gt; with that one to have a reference to look at.. Your choice though!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You gave a lot of signposts to look for. It`s encouraging to hear you have
&gt; good results wrapping the C API and I won't sweat having to someone else's.

Recommendation from a C++ fan:  stick with JACK's C API.

There aren't any good C++ API's for JACK.  The ones that 
exist are very limiting.  Plus, the C API is simple enough 
that it doesn't make a lot of sense to wrap the API.

&gt; channel(through Jack) to and from the hardware. The question is whether Jack
&gt; can handle the larger sysexec messages. I know ALSA does fine with them

The answer is: no.

This has been discussed a bunch on this list... so you might 
want to search through the archives.

&gt; Yeah, I do have a few years behind me developing database
&gt; applications(mainly java/c#). It's the understanding of the Jack API,
&gt; wxWidgets and learning C/C++(or relearning it after over 10 years of not
&gt; using it since my undergraduate days) that are the main hurdles.

Why wxWidgets?  I've never had a good experience with that.

I would recommend a Qt or GTK+ route.  You'll get more bang 
for your buck.
