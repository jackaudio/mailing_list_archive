This is correct.

Recommendation from a C++ fan:  stick with JACK's C API.

There aren't any good C++ API's for JACK.  The ones that 
exist are very limiting.  Plus, the C API is simple enough 
that it doesn't make a lot of sense to wrap the API.

The answer is: no.

This has been discussed a bunch on this list... so you might 
want to search through the archives.

Why wxWidgets?  I've never had a good experience with that.

I would recommend a Qt or GTK+ route.  You'll get more bang 
for your buck.
