&gt;  I just use the standard  jack.h  c header, and wrote my own class around

&gt;&gt;&gt; stick
&gt;&gt;&gt; with that one to have a reference to look at.. Your choice though!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You gave a lot of signposts to look for. It`s encouraging to hear you have
&gt;&gt; good results wrapping the C API and I won't sweat having to someone
&gt;&gt; else's.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Recommendation from a C++ fan:  stick with JACK's C API.
&gt;
&gt; There aren't any good C++ API's for JACK.  The ones that exist are very
&gt; limiting.  Plus, the C API is simple enough that it doesn't make a lot of
&gt; sense to wrap the API.


This is sounding better all the time. :-)

 channel(through Jack) to and from the hardware. The question is whether
&gt; Jack
&gt; can handle the larger sysexec messages. I know ALSA does fine with them
&gt;

The answer is: no.
&gt;
&gt; This has been discussed a bunch on this list... so you might want to search
&gt; through the archives.


Sorry, I should have checked first. At this point I'll take your word on it
though.


&gt;
&gt;  Yeah, I do have a few years behind me developing database
&gt;&gt; applications(mainly java/c#). It's the understanding of the Jack API,
&gt;&gt; wxWidgets and learning C/C++(or relearning it after over 10 years of not
&gt;&gt; using it since my undergraduate days) that are the main hurdles.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Why wxWidgets?  I've never had a good experience with that.
&gt;
&gt; I would recommend a Qt or GTK+ route.  You'll get more bang for your buck.
&gt;

I was thinking it may be a good route to take, so as to be portable to win
and os x also. I'm not all that familiar with the GUI libraries. I will
definitely listen to your recommendation.
