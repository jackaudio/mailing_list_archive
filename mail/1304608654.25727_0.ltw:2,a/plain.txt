I should probably be a little clearer too.

It *is* possible to deliver large sysex (or other) messages via JACK
MIDI, but the API does not provide you any help doing so. You will
have to break the message into chunks and send a bit out at every
process() callback. Most people would view this as "cannot be done" -
others might see it as a way to spend a glorious spring weekend having
fun :)
