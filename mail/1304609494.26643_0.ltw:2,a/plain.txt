JACK's MIDI API is simply awesome for everything BUT large 
sysex dumps.  However, there are workarounds (if you know 
the size in advance and don't mind starting/stopping the 
jack server).

GTK+ and Qt run great on Windows and OS X.

My preference is Qt (a C++ only API).  A lot of folks in the 
audio community really like GTK+ and gtkmm (a C++ wrapper). 
If you flip a coin, you won't go wrong with either one.
