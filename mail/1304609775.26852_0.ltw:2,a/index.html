&gt; &gt; The key point is that you cannot currently do what you want to do with
&gt; &gt; the JACK MIDI API. Its that simple. Devan has made some reasonable
&gt; &gt; looking proposals on extending the API to make this sort of thing
&gt; &gt; possible, but they are not currently implemented and as far as I know,
&gt; &gt; nobody is working on even a test implementation.
&gt;
&gt; I should probably be a little clearer too.
&gt;
&gt; It *is* possible to deliver large sysex (or other) messages via JACK
&gt; MIDI, but the API does not provide you any help doing so. You will
&gt; have to break the message into chunks and send a bit out at every
&gt; process() callback. Most people would view this as "cannot be done" -
&gt; others might see it as a way to spend a glorious spring weekend having
&gt; fun :)
&gt;

Well, hmm, would that be coming and going from both ends? That is, will I
have that ability from the hardware, which has no way of controlling the
rate or size of data being sent? It just dumps it. Sorry for the very green
question, but how big of chuck is Jack going to handle before it discards
stuff in bytes? If you know?
