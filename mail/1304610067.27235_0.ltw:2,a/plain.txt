the input side is bad news: the existing bridges (a2jmidid, -Xseq and
-Xraw) will either throw away or truncate long messages.

on the output side, you can call jack_port_type_buffer_size (client,
JACK_DEFAULT_MIDI_TYPE) to get the buffer size or you can just keep
calling jack_midi_event_reserve() until it fails (which you should
likely do anyway)
