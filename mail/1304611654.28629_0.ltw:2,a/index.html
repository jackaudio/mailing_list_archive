&gt;&gt; Sorry, I should have checked first. At this point I'll take your word on
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; though.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; JACK's MIDI API is simply awesome for everything BUT large sysex dumps.
&gt;  However, there are workarounds (if you know the size in advance and don't
&gt; mind starting/stopping the jack server).


If I have to, I'll see if I can take that on. Indeed, Jack MIDI and Audio
are awesome. That's why I want to stay with Linux for my needs. As much as I
am using Linux for audio, I am also using and love hardware. It's really
troublesome for me to keep another windows computer(only chosen because they
can be had for less than $50) around to control my hardware synths, however.
I am ready to step up to remedy that and want to do something that advances
my C++ skills anyway.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Why wxWidgets?  I've never had a good experience with that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would recommend a Qt or GTK+ route.  You'll get more bang for your
&gt;&gt;&gt; buck.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  I was thinking it may be a good route to take, so as to be portable to
&gt;&gt; win
&gt;&gt; and os x also. I'm not all that familiar with the GUI libraries. I will
&gt;&gt; definitely listen to your recommendation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; GTK+ and Qt run great on Windows and OS X.
&gt;
&gt; My preference is Qt (a C++ only API).  A lot of folks in the audio
&gt; community really like GTK+ and gtkmm (a C++ wrapper). If you flip a coin,
&gt; you won't go wrong with either one.
&gt;
&gt; -gabriel
&gt;

Thanks, the coin will land on the first one I understand first. ;-), but I
will, indeed, try to both.
