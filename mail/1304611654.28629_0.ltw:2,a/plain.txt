If I have to, I'll see if I can take that on. Indeed, Jack MIDI and Audio
are awesome. That's why I want to stay with Linux for my needs. As much as I
am using Linux for audio, I am also using and love hardware. It's really
troublesome for me to keep another windows computer(only chosen because they
can be had for less than $50) around to control my hardware synths, however.
I am ready to step up to remedy that and want to do something that advances
my C++ skills anyway.

Thanks, the coin will land on the first one I understand first. ;-), but I
will, indeed, try to both.
