One of the reasons I haven't been more motivated to create a test
implementation is that I didn't know, until now, whether or not either
of the two proposed solutions is reasonable. ;)

I've talked with St√©phane a bit about creating a JACK 2 implementation
for the second proposal, but haven't had time to sit down and write
the code.

Any more feedback I can get from the community on either of the two
solutions (especially the second solution) would be appreciated. :)
