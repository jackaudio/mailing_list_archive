this is not a reply to your question directly.

i think it is well past the time that the fledgling jack-on-windows
community puts together some basic document (possibly entries for the
JACK FAQ) that we can easily point people at who are curious about
JACK on Windows. interest in the technology has been growing steadily,
and its getting a little frustrating to have nothing to point people
at to get them clear on what JACK can do on Windows and to answer
basic usage questions.

i know that its been traditional to write such things on the trac wiki
first, and that's fine, but i would really like to migrate something
*soon* onto the main part of the website and be able to refer email
and IRC first-timers to it.

thanks.
