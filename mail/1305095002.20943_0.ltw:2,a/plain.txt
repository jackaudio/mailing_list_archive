Hi,

@Paul, I can get a document to you later on today for the 'Jack for
Windows' community. It will be based on the experiences of the jOrgan
Windows group. What format would you like it in (Wiki, HTML, or
something else)?

@focaltemporal
Take a look at my draft tutorial for the jOrgan group at
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jorgan/index.php?title=Instructions_on_using_the_Jack_Audio_Connection_Kit_in_Windows

The basic answer is Yes you can use Jack for ASIO applications by
using the JackRouter driver, but with some configuration required. I
don't have ableton live, but if it allows ASIO Input and Output, then
Yes.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
