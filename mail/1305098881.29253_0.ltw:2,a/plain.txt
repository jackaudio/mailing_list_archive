Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: jack, and...windows

Hi,
I'm using Jack on windows for more than a year now and for me is a great help on many occasions.
Grand Orgue, then jOrgan were the programs I started, but it can work with many many windows virtual instruments and effects.
I do not have Ableton, I'm a REAPER user, but as Jack can work great with Reaper I don't see why not with Ableton. Also MULAB, MTStudio and Orion work with Jack here (windows7)
Follow GrahamG's instructions on how to set JackPortaudio properties to Asio drivers (i'm using Asio4All v2.10), then it's easy. Jack Control will do all connections you want.

Best
Panos

hello, after many months struggling, seeking an opensource alternative to ableton live's intuitive, all-in-one features, i've surrendered.

so, now i'm back on windows (that's not the main reason I turned to the darkside again...) and I would like to use jack...

how can I make jack to work with asio drivers? can I plug it to ableton live?

thanks from portugal!
