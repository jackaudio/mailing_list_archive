Thanks. :)

I was thinking mostly in terms of JACK 2 drivers when I wrote this,
and didn't give as much consideration to the JACK 1 drivers (I don't
know the codebase very well - perhaps I should take some time to learn
about it) or the JACK client API; hence, the JACK 2-centric message.
In retrospect, I should have given them the same consideration.
