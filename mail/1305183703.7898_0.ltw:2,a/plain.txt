Given that Windows has different process priorities, why shouldn't the
user be able to set JACK's process priority in order to find the best
way for JACK to operate on his/her system?

I'm not sure this is an argument for not allowing the user to set a
process priority, given that I'm proposing that threads would still
receive relative priorities based on the jobs they're performing (i.e.
the critical MIDI thread would still have a higher priority than the
audio thread, which would still have a higher priority than the
callback thread, and so forth ...).  The process priority is an
absolute value, and the thread priority values change relative to the
process priority.

Ignoring MMCSS for a moment, there are two basic thread priority
values a thread can have in JACK 2: THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL (if a
thread doesn't request realtime) and THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL (if
a thread does request realtime) ... with nothing in between.  This
makes it impossible to create differences in realtime priorities in
threads.

MMCSS, when it's implemented, adds another sort of priority when the
-P switch is set to 90 or above.

I can't help but feel that the current situation is hackish and cheap.

Yes, but what about the differences in priority between the audio and
MIDI threads?

I see potential mappings to start with:

PRIORITY_AUDIO: the values taken from the CoreAudio audio thread
PRIORITY_MIDI_TERMINAL: the values CoreMIDI uses

:)

I can think of a potential practical use for this sort of thing.
Let's assume that someone wanted to write an audio driver for bindings
that were available on more than one operating system (i.e.
PortAudio), or wanted to write a MIDI driver for bindings that were
available on more than one operating system (i.e. PortMIDI, RtMidi).
Instead of creating a bunch of ugly #ifdef's, the driver could use the
appropriate constant to set the thread priority.
