&gt; Look at the table at the bottom of
&gt; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms685100(v=vs.85).aspx
&gt; (the "Base priority")
&gt;
&gt; Basically the way I understand is:
&gt;
&gt; - in *any* process priory class, the
&gt; THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL (currently used for audio and
&gt; MIDI RT) is actually 15
&gt;
&gt; - the only way to boost that value is to move the *entire process* to
&gt; REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS but then *all other threads* of this
&gt; process will get crazy values between 16 and 31, that is *above* any
&gt; THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL value that a process *below*
&gt; REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS would have taken... this is just wrong.

I'm not convinced that this is wrong in every case.  I think that
giving the choice to the user and letting him/her determine the best
process priority for his/her system is a good idea.  I think issuing a
very obvious warning containing lots of capital letters when running
in REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS is also a good idea. :)

The process priority is less important if MMCSS is available, but
that's not always the case.  It's my understanding that many Windows
pro audio users still use Windows XP.

&gt; - in the presence of MIDI and audio thread, what should we do? keep
&gt; the process in NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS , set the audio RT to
&gt; THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST (so actually 10) and the MIDI RT to
&gt; THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL (so actually 15). Not sure it
&gt; will improve the situation..

I think the process should run in NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS by default,
and that the process priority should be adjustable via a command line
argument.

I'm not totally convinced it will improve the situation either, but,
given that JACK 2 runs on Windows and is going to continue to run on
Windows, I would like to see the situation improve as much as it
possibly can.

&gt;&gt; MMCSS, when it's implemented, adds another sort of priority when the
&gt;&gt; -P switch is set to 90 or above.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can't help but feel that the current situation is hackish and cheap.
&gt;
&gt; So my feeling is that this process/thread priority description is
&gt; basically flawed on Windows, and this is probably the reason they
&gt; added another flawed concept like MMCSS...

I mostly agree with you, but I think MMCSS does help the situation a
bit.  When MMCSS is available, it should definitely be used, as it
solves the problem with process priorities that you identified
earlier; that is, that a higher process priority changes the priority
of *every* thread instead of the changing the priority of the threads
that need to have high priorities.

Some possible mappings using MMCSS:

PRIORITY_AUDIO: Task Name - "Pro Audio", AVRT_PRIORITY_HIGH
PRIORITY_CALLBACK: no MMCSS, THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL
PRIORITY_MIDI_TERMINAL: Task Name - "Pro Audio", AVRT_PRIORITY_CRITICAL

&gt;&gt; I can think of a potential practical use for this sort of thing.
&gt;&gt; Let's assume that someone wanted to write an audio driver for bindings
&gt;&gt; that were available on more than one operating system (i.e.
&gt;&gt; PortAudio), or wanted to write a MIDI driver for bindings that were
&gt;&gt; available on more than one operating system (i.e. PortMIDI, RtMidi).
&gt;&gt; Instead of creating a bunch of ugly #ifdef's, the driver could use the
&gt;&gt; appropriate constant to set the thread priority.
&gt;
&gt; Sure I agree with that, I'm just saying we can improve a bit (abstract
&gt; some OS specificities) but not expect miracles...

I don't expect any miracles.  However, since JACK 2 is running on
Windows, I would like to see Windows users get a fighting chance.
