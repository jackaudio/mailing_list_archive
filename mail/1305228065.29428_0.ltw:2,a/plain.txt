But you see on the http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms685100(v=vs.85).aspx table that *only* process REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS will actually change the actual value of the THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL right? But then *all threads* (even GUI ones...) of this process will by higher that any thread of *any* other lover priority process running on the machine... 

And the following is clearly written:

"You should almost never use REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS, because this interrupts system threads that manage mouse input, keyboard input, and background disk flushing. This class can be appropriate for applications that "talk" directly to hardware or that perform brief tasks that should have limited interruptions."

Using MMCSS in the appropriate manner will makes much more sense... I'll work more in that direction

And I really don"t think we can do better for XP users BTW.
