&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the process should run in NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS by default,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and that the process priority should be adjustable via a command line
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not totally convinced it will improve the situation either, but,
&gt;&gt;&gt; given that JACK 2 runs on Windows and is going to continue to run on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Windows, I would like to see the situation improve as much as it
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibly can.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; But you see on the
&gt;&gt; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms685100(v=vs.85).aspx table
&gt;&gt; that *only* process REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS will actually change
&gt;&gt; the actual value of the THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL right? But
&gt;&gt; then *all threads* (even GUI ones...) of this process will by higher that any
&gt;&gt; thread of *any* other lover priority process running on the machine...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; And the following is clearly written:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; "You should almost never use REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS, because
&gt;&gt; this interrupts system threads that manage mouse input, keyboard input,
&gt;&gt; and background disk flushing. This class can be appropriate for
&gt;&gt; applications that "talk" directly to hardware or that perform brief tasks
&gt;&gt; that should have limited interruptions."
&gt; 
&gt; I do see that.  I also see the absolute thread priority levels that
&gt; are issued when a process has REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS:
&gt; 
&gt;    THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE 16
&gt;    THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST 22
&gt;    THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL 23
&gt;    THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL 24
&gt;    THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL 25
&gt;    THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST 26
&gt;    THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL 31
&gt; 
&gt; ... and can see the absolute thread priority levels that are issued
&gt; with MMCSS (from
&gt; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx -
&gt; see the table at the bottom of the page):
&gt; 
&gt;    High
&gt;    23-26
&gt;    These threads run at a thread priority that is lower than only certain
&gt;    system-level tasks. This category is designed for Pro Audio tasks.
&gt; 
&gt; ... and I don't see much difference, save for THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL.
&gt; 
&gt; So, perhaps a mapping adjustment can be made when the process has a
&gt; priority of REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS:
&gt; 
&gt;   PRIORITY_AUDIO: THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL
&gt;   PRIORITY_CALLBACK: THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL
&gt;   PRIORITY_MIDI_TERMINAL: THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST
&gt; 
&gt; It's true that threads that don't need to have realtime priority will
&gt; have elevated priorities too,

Yes this is the main problem...

&gt; but I think it's important to take into
&gt; account what those specific threads are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; So, uh ... what are those specific threads doing? :)

Any GUI thread, disk access, main thread... Think about any standard audio application (Reason, Live....) that the user start using JackRouter ASIO/JACK bridge. If this process get REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS, then it will certainly cause problem for any other running application.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Using MMCSS in the appropriate manner will makes much more
&gt;&gt; sense... I'll work more in that direction
&gt; 
&gt; Very cool. :)
