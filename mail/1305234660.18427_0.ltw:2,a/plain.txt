OK this could make more sense, and would help for the audio/MIDI threads. 

But then I guess all other threads of JACK server (like the server/client communication one) should be lowered, possibly to THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE ( which is finally still 16, that is again... over THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL thread of any other process...) Hum... (1)

Then the Audio RT thread of clients should be handled in another process class,... hum (2) and we also have the issue that internal JACK clients running in the server process would be "boosted" so possibly behave differently than other out of process JACK clients Hum (3)...
