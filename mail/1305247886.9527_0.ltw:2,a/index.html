Salut St&#xE9;phane and list,

jack2 fails to build if libsamplerate is not present.

libsamplerate is checked and correctly marked as missing during
configure stage. However netlib build is still attempted:

-------------------------------------------

I've made a changeset that disables build of netlib, jack_net_slave and
jack_net_master when libsamplerate is not available. The commit is in
the git branch called fix-libsamplerate-less-build.

Feel free to correct/improve in that branch and remove it if it gets
merged to master/trunk.
