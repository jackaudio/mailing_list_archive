&gt; Salut St&#xE9;phane and list,
&gt; 
&gt; jack2 fails to build if libsamplerate is not present.
&gt; 
&gt; libsamplerate is checked and correctly marked as missing during
&gt; configure stage. However netlib build is still attempted:

&gt;        {task: cxx JackAudioAdapterInterface.cpp -&gt; JackAudioAdapterInterface_2.o}
&gt; -------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; I've made a changeset that disables build of netlib, jack_net_slave and
&gt; jack_net_master when libsamplerate is not available. The commit is in
&gt; the git branch called fix-libsamplerate-less-build.
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to correct/improve in that branch and remove it if it gets
&gt; merged to master/trunk.
&gt; 

Merged back on SVN trunk.

Thanks.

St&#xE9;phane
