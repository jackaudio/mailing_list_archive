&gt;&gt; - concerning OSX: as I said there is no priority setting in the RT 
&gt;&gt; class. But this is more "reservation" like approach, Basically a 
&gt;&gt; period, a "uninteruptible computation grain", and a "constraint" 
&gt;&gt; (which is basically equals to the period.

For what it matters, this kind of model is the same that we need to 
exploit the deadline-based scheduler we're experimenting on Linux 
(presented during the last LAC): we identified the resource requirements 
of jackd and all of the involved client threads, in terms of how much 
computation-time is needed every period, and we've set-up parameters 
into the scheduler accordingly.
AFAICS, currently this fComputation value is set-up statically to a 
random value ("500*1000"), or sometimes computed in a way I hope 
somebody can explain:

   driver-&gt;fEngineControl-&gt;fComputation = 
driver-&gt;fEngineControl-&gt;fPeriod * driver-&gt;fComputationGrain;

Perhaps there's a chance to reuse a part of this deadline-based work on 
Linux also for setting up some more meaningful values on OS-X. However, 
that needs to be crossed with info about what the kernel actually does 
with those parameters. With Linux, that was easy: the whole set of 
threads were getting (at least) that required computation-time every period.

&gt;&gt; Periodic tasks (like the audio ones) have to defines their period, 
&gt;&gt; MIDI task don"t need that (period = 0).

Probably I don't know much about how MIDI is coming in the loop: when 
are MIDI clients "polled" by Jack, as compared to the periodic main 
audio cycle ?
If I have both a MIDI-enabled and an audio-enabled client, let's say a 
synthesizer (MIDI inputs and audio outputs), then does it have now 2 
jack threads (one activated for processing MIDI the other for audio) ?

Thanks,

     T.
