&gt;&gt;&gt; Any GUI thread, disk access, main thread... Think about any standard

&gt;&gt; Oh! &#xA0;I see where there's a miscommunication.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that JACK 2 should set the process priority of client
&gt;&gt; processes; I'm saying that JACK 2 should allow its *own* process
&gt;&gt; priority to be set via a command line argument.
&gt;
&gt; OK this could make more sense, and would help for the audio/MIDI
&gt; threads.
&gt;
&gt; But then I guess all other threads of JACK server (like the server/client
&gt; communication one) should be lowered, possibly to
&gt; THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE ( which is finally still 16, that is again... over
&gt; THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL thread of any other process...)
&gt; Hum... (1)

How much processing does the server do?  How much would it get in the
way of other JACK clients?  Maybe this question is dependent on a
person's particular usage of JACK, such that REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS
might work for some people and not for others.

&gt; Then the Audio RT thread of clients should be handled in another
&gt; process class,... hum (2)

Maybe.  Other client processes can potentially gain higher process
priorities too.  JACK 2 can't really control what happens in this
case, which makes it more important for the process priority of JACK 2
to be configurable.

&gt; and we also have the issue that internal JACK clients running in the
&gt; server process would be "boosted" so possibly behave differently
&gt; than other out of process JACK clients Hum (3)...

How might they behave differently?
