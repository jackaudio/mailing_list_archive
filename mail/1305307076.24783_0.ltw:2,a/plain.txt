How much processing does the server do?  How much would it get in the
way of other JACK clients?  Maybe this question is dependent on a
person's particular usage of JACK, such that REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS
might work for some people and not for others.

Maybe.  Other client processes can potentially gain higher process
priorities too.  JACK 2 can't really control what happens in this
case, which makes it more important for the process priority of JACK 2
to be configurable.

How might they behave differently?
