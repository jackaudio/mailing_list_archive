&gt; Le 4 avr. 09 &#xE0; 10:23, Macintosh User a &#xE9;crit :
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; First of all, I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this  
&gt; &gt; question. I am using JACK to beam audio from my laptop macbook pro  
&gt; &gt; to a linux box connected to speakers. After I got everything set  
&gt; &gt; up, I was very happy to see that itunes works great. Better than  
&gt; &gt; esound daemon I might add. But if I try to watch a flash movie from  
&gt; &gt; youtube in firefox or safari, the video is all sped up like fast  
&gt; &gt; forward and the sound is all choppy.
&gt; 
&gt; This is known problem with the Flash player badly interacting with  
&gt; "JackRouter", the bridge JACK/CoreAudio component that is used to  
&gt; have CoreAudio applications become JACK clients on OSX.
&gt; 
&gt; It was working correctly with an older version of Flash, and stopped  
&gt; with more recent ones. It also works correctly with some video and  
&gt; don't work with some others.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to debug that an entire day, but could not find the reason...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My question is basically if there's a way to get youtube sound to  
&gt; &gt; work over the network using JACK. With esound it worked, but  
&gt; &gt; sometimes it would be out of sync, or the sound would crackle and pop.
&gt; 
&gt; Try to report the problem to Adobe, so that at some point we may have  
&gt; a contact with technical people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If it is relevant I am using JackOSX on the Mac and Jack2 on the  
&gt; &gt; linux box connected to speakers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;

Not sure if this is helpful but I've been seeing this for a while on 
my own system very annoying! - don't think it's been fixed has 
it? I've found if you wait until the whole video has been loaded 
and then go back, the sound works perfectly, but the video is 
still too fast. The sound will continue playing far after the video
has completed. Almost like they are relying on the polling (I think
 core audio is inherently poll based right?) to determine playback 
rate for both when first streaming, but only video once the movie 
has been completely downloaded.... Seeking in the video is 
also correct, but again video playback goes bonkers once started.

Will send a similar message to Adobe - hopefully their people 
can provide some insight into what they might be expecting 
from the router.
