Not sure if this is helpful but I've been seeing this for a while on 
my own system very annoying! - don't think it's been fixed has 
it? I've found if you wait until the whole video has been loaded 
and then go back, the sound works perfectly, but the video is 
still too fast. The sound will continue playing far after the video
has completed. Almost like they are relying on the polling (I think
 core audio is inherently poll based right?) to determine playback 
rate for both when first streaming, but only video once the movie 
has been completely downloaded.... Seeking in the video is 
also correct, but again video playback goes bonkers once started.

Will send a similar message to Adobe - hopefully their people 
can provide some insight into what they might be expecting 
from the router.
