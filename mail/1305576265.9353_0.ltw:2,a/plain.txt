While I did rewrite the CoreMIDI driver for JACK 2, I had no way of
testing it and I've never used it.  So, the following might be bogus.

With JACK 2, you can specify a number of virtual inputs and a number
of virtual outputs as arguments to the JACK CoreMIDI driver.
Unfortunately, I have no idea how those arguments might be set, as
MIDI drivers can't take arguments at the command line.  It's my
understanding that `jackdbus` can handle slave driver arguments, but I
don't know if `jackdbus` runs on any other platform besides Linux, or
if there is an equivalent on Mac.

Stéphane and Nedko may have more to say about this.
