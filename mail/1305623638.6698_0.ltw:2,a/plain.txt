I think we should distinguish several things, in JACK2:

1) what happens on server side : the code for signal management is located in two functions jackctl_setup_signals and jackctl_wait_signals (part of the so called "control API")

2) on server side, the desire to precisely control the signal setup, depending of the kind of process that is going to use the "libjackserver" library (up to now: jackd or jackdbus)

3) what happens on client (libjack) side: right now the SIGPIPE signal is filtered to avoid JACK clients receive a SIGPIPE when trying to access a died server (see JackLibGlobals constructor in JackLibGlobals.h)

4) an additional somewhat separated issue is the use of non appropriate API (like "sigprocmask" instead of "pthread_sigmask")

We should probably try to refine 1) and 2) to see if  jackctl_setup_signals and jackctl_wait_signals have to be redesigned to be more flexible. What are the precise constraints for jackdbus? Nedko can you refine?  3) should be possibly redesigned (is "chaining handlers" mandatory in this case?)  4) is probably easy (API adaptation).
