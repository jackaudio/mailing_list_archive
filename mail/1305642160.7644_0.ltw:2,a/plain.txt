There is a distinction between the "input", "output" and "system" default devices

iTunes uses the "output default" (not the "system default")

This is clearly possible since ITunes uses the "output default" device. With running JACK server, you'll just have to select "JackRouter" as the "output default"  device (BTW JackRouter cannot be used as system default")
