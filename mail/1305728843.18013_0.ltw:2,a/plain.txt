Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JackSession - feedback

Hi,

Thanks again for your work on JackSession.

Some feedback / questions.

It's a pitty that you can 't open session saved by qjackctl with 
pyjacksm and vice versa. We should avoid such compatibility issues in 
LAU | LAD as much as possible imho.

Qjackctl:

* I find it a bit strange that there is no option to quit the session, 
like you have in jacksmtray. It's only possible to 'save and quit'.
* When I save a session, I have to make a folder and save it. If I save 
it a second time, qjackctl session opens the filebrowser *inside* that 
folder, so I have to go one folder level back and then save it. I think 
it should open the folder where the session folders are located. (also 
true for 'load').

*
A session with Qtractor, did save ok the first time, but not the second 
time:

16:06:44.793 Session could not be saved to 
"/home/derick/linuxaudio/JackSessions/qtractortest2/Qtractor/Funk.qtz". 
Sorry.

16:06:48.009 Save session: 
"/home/derick/linuxaudio/JackSessions/qtractortest2/Qtractor/Funk.qtz".


So reloading the session didn't reload the Funk.qtz file (qtractor has 
removed that in 'the archive')

* Yoshimi seems to work ok, so does a test -- not-yet-released -- 
version of Pianoteq (shortly tested).

Pyjacksm:

* I couldn't load sessions yet (discussed on IRC)
* Couldn't find a button to quit jacksmtray


Regards,
