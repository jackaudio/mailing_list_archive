&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again for your work on JackSession.
&gt;
&gt; Some feedback / questions.
&gt;
&gt; It's a pitty that you can 't open session saved by qjackctl with
&gt; pyjacksm and vice versa. We should avoid such compatibility issues in
&gt; LAU | LAD as much as possible imho.
&gt;

qjackctl and pyjacksm session description files (session.xml) are *not* 
compatible with each other. although they both relate the very same 
things in principle, they just do it with slightly different enough markup.

under qjackctl you can have any directory in your file-system for saving 
a jack-session. last time i look, pyjacksm does a fixed directory for 
all jack-sessions as sub-dirs.


&gt; Qjackctl:
&gt;
&gt; * I find it a bit strange that there is no option to quit the session,
&gt; like you have in jacksmtray. It's only possible to 'save and quit'.

yes, that's been deliberate: qjackctl does not implement the just-quit 
jack-session option. what's the use case of it anyway, may i ask?


&gt; * When I save a session, I have to make a folder and save it. If I save
&gt; it a second time, qjackctl session opens the filebrowser *inside* that
&gt; folder, so I have to go one folder level back and then save it. I think
&gt; it should open the folder where the session folders are located. (also
&gt; true for 'load').
&gt;

yes, that's awful true. but read above: there's no central point "where 
session folders are located" notion on qjackctl, it just picks on the 
last one one you saved or loaded.

i reckon the qt4 directory selector dialog is not a prime in 
intuitiveness for this very purpose. yes, you have to go back one parent 
folder and hit "new folder.." button there to create a brand new session 
directory--that's a fact and maybe annoying for some ;)


&gt; *
&gt; A session with Qtractor, did save ok the first time, but not the second
&gt; time:
&gt;
&gt; 16:06:44.793 Session could not be saved to
&gt; "/home/derick/linuxaudio/JackSessions/qtractortest2/Qtractor/Funk.qtz".
&gt; Sorry.
&gt;
&gt; 16:06:48.009 Save session:
&gt; "/home/derick/linuxaudio/JackSessions/qtractortest2/Qtractor/Funk.qtz".
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So reloading the session didn't reload the Funk.qtz file (qtractor has
&gt; removed that in 'the archive')
&gt;

WARNING:

there's a serious issue on qtractor 0.4.8 re. saving a jack-session over 
an existing one that you saved earlier and reloaded as current.

by default and until very recently, qtractor was saving its own session 
state into a zip-archive which bundles all media content into one single 
file (.qtz suffix).

adding horror to tragedy, qjackctl wipes out everything under an 
existing directory after prompting for any jack-session save process. so 
when you agree to save and replace over that, and there's where it comes 
to tragedy then horror, all media content will be toast!

again, this is a qtractor 0.4.8 issue, an ugly and serious one--as you 
might already inferred there's an awful high risk of permanent data loss 
in there--alas, this has all been already addressed in current svn trunk.

meanwhile, please avoid as much as you can to save and replace a 
jack-session over an existing directory, specially one which the 
currently qtractor loaded one participates--ALWAYS create a brand new 
one (new jack-session directory)--at least until an update from the 
latest qtractor svn trunk is in place ;)

cheers
