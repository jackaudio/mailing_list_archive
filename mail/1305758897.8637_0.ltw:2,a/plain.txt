You fixed this bug in qtractor, but what about other apps? Wouldn't it be 
easier to have some kind of versioning inside the qjackctls session format, 
where each version gets its own version and old versions are only removed when 
the new ones are saved okay? And apps are only responsible to copy/move/link 
all the data belonging to their session.

Have fun,

Arnold
