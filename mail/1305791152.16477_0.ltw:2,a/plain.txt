From somebody who has never used jack-session:

    1. Load an existing session
    2. Modify something
    3. Decide you want to discard all changes

Isn't "quit-without-save" exactly this? If quitting always means
"overwrite my settings", how would you implement a rollback? (without
revision control in the file system?)

Needless to say that many programs out there have separate "save" and
"quit" buttons. "You have unsaved changes. Do you really want to quit?"


WRT interoperability between pysmjack (or however it is called) and
qjackctl's save file: From a user's point of view, it seems justified to
expect transparency. Maybe some XML translation magic (xslt?) can
translate between the two formats when adapting the formats itself isn't
possible.
