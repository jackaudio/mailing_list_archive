&gt; You fixed this bug in qtractor, but what about other apps? Wouldn't 
&gt; it be
&gt; easier to have some kind of versioning inside the qjackctls session 
&gt; format,
&gt; where each version gets its own version and old versions are only
&gt; removed when
&gt; the new ones are saved okay? And apps are only responsible to 
&gt; copy/move/link
&gt; all the data belonging to their session.
&gt;

 this is kind of specific to this qtractor-session file format (.qtz 
 bundle) where all live media content is unzipped below the jack-session 
 subdirectory...

 when you save and replace a jack-session directory you'll be wiping out 
 all content either from disk (qjackctl) or from sight (pyjacksm renames 
 the old directory iirc) so you'll end with a broken qtractor-session 
 state file anyway.

 afaict, on the jack-session protocol, applications are not responsible 
 to copy, move or link their data anyway as they never know whether 
 they're replacing any previously existing jack-session directory or 
 not--from their pov it's all a brand new jack-session coming up.

 a /highly/ responsible jack-session manager would do better to create a 
 temporary session directory first, then call all apps to store their 
 data there and only after that it would rename the old and new 
 jack-session directories, or copy, move or link all stored application 
 state data from thereafter. qjackctl might try this in the future :)

 anyways, qtractor's tragic issue has been solved by regression to old 
 and regular session state file format, which refers to all media content 
 as found on their original file-system location, ie. relative to 
 qtractor-session directory, which must *not* be the same as the 
 jack-session directory at all. lesson learned :)
