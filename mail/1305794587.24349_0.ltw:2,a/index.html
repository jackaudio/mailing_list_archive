&gt; &gt;&gt;adding horror to tragedy, qjackctl wipes out everything under an

&gt; &gt;&gt;when you agree to save and replace over that, and there's where
&gt; &gt;&gt;it comes
&gt; &gt;&gt;to tragedy then horror, all media content will be toast!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You fixed this bug in qtractor, but what about other apps?
&gt; &gt;Wouldn't it be
&gt; &gt;easier to have some kind of versioning inside the qjackctls
&gt; &gt;session format,
&gt; &gt;where each version gets its own version and old versions are only
&gt; &gt;removed when
&gt; &gt;the new ones are saved okay? And apps are only responsible to
&gt; &gt;copy/move/link
&gt; &gt;all the data belonging to their session.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; this is kind of specific to this qtractor-session file format (.qtz
&gt; bundle) where all live media content is unzipped below the
&gt; jack-session subdirectory...
&gt; 
&gt; when you save and replace a jack-session directory you'll be wiping
&gt; out all content either from disk (qjackctl) or from sight (pyjacksm
&gt; renames the old directory iirc) so you'll end with a broken
&gt; qtractor-session state file anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; afaict, on the jack-session protocol, applications are not
&gt; responsible to copy, move or link their data anyway as they never
&gt; know whether they're replacing any previously existing jack-session
&gt; directory or not--from their pov it's all a brand new jack-session
&gt; coming up.
&gt; 
&gt; a /highly/ responsible jack-session manager would do better to
&gt; create a temporary session directory first, then call all apps to
&gt; store their data there and only after that it would rename the old
&gt; and new jack-session directories, or copy, move or link all stored
&gt; application state data from thereafter. qjackctl might try this in
&gt; the future :)

thats what pyjacksm does.
however some programs actually called jack_session_reply() before
saving their data. 
resulting in pyjacksm pulling the directory away underneath them.
it looks like i am seeing this kind of behaviour with a debian version
of yoshimi, although i dont see it in the source.
&gt; 
&gt; anyways, qtractor's tragic issue has been solved by regression to
&gt; old and regular session state file format, which refers to all media
&gt; content as found on their original file-system location, ie.
&gt; relative to qtractor-session directory, which must *not* be the same
&gt; as the jack-session directory at all. lesson learned :)
&gt; 
&gt; cheers
