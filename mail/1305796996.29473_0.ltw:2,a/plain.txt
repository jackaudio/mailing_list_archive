Add apps that don't copy their data on save, but try to create hard-links for 
big files.
Add folders that have a timestamp or other uuid in the name.
Remove the automatic removal of the previous sessions folder.
Add a nice "go back" button/functionality to your session managment apps.

Then you get what I tried to explain yesterday evening...

Have fun,

Arnold
