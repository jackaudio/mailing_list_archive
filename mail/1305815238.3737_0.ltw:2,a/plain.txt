its a wierd piece of behaviour by the kernel. i remember seeing this
is in a different context (ardour uses the same basic mechanisms
internally) and could never figure out why the kernel would return
EAGAIN for some reads from a pipe. i've not seen it in a long time.

do you have a new kernel or any other low-level system updates that
happened recently?
