jackdbus can handle them but only the svn version (or git version from
ladi-experimental branch).

I'm not aware of anybody that ran jackdbus on any other platform
besides Linux. It is probably perfectly possible on MacOS because AFAIK
dbus is in macports. For Windows I think there is attempt of complete
rewrite of D-Bus but I don't know the details. IMO jackdbus matters
mainly on Linux. Using D-Bus on other systems even if possible may not
be the best approach.
