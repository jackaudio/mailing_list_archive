This filtering should be performed ONLY in libjack-created threads,
and only via the correct per-thread API calls. As long as this is
true, I think I have no objection (except that it needs to be spelled
out clearly in the docs.)

[ Perhaps this is already true. I had a problem with signals when I
sent the original e-mail, searched the Jack codebase for API calls,
discovered what I have already reported, then realized my problem was
due to something else. ]


Best,
Dan
