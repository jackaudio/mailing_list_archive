Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK 0.120.2 released

Jack 0.120.2 is now available.

      http://jackaudio.org/downloads/jack-audio-connection-kit-0.120.2.tar.gz

This is primarily a bug fix release, though some of the bugs are important.

Fixes/Changes

    * Fix issues with stack initialization in client threads that
stole large chunks of the stack from applications.
    * if the ALSA backend finds that a device is busy, try to tell the
user what application(s) are using it (via stderr).
    * Reimplement the jack_cycle_wait/jack_cycle_signal() API for OS
X, where in previous versions it was completely non-functional.
    * extended documentation for the transport API data structures.
    * extended documentation for the JACK Session API
    * more useful warning message when duplicate port registration is attempted
    * fix logic for setting up device parameters in the ALSA backend
(fixes JACK startup on some ALSA-supported devices that would report
"impossible sample width (1) discovered" during startup).
