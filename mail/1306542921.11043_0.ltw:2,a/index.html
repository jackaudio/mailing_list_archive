&gt;&gt;&gt;  I think we should distinguish several things, in JACK2:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) what happens on server side : the code for signal management is
&gt;&gt;&gt; located in two functions jackctl_setup_signals and
&gt;&gt;&gt; jackctl_wait_signals (part of the so called "control API")
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) on server side, the desire to precisely control the signal
&gt;&gt;&gt; setup, depending of the kind of process that is going to use the
&gt;&gt;&gt; "libjackserver" library (up to now: jackd or jackdbus)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) what happens on client (libjack) side: right now the SIGPIPE
&gt;&gt;&gt; signal is filtered to avoid JACK clients receive a SIGPIPE when
&gt;&gt;&gt; trying to access a died server (see JackLibGlobals constructor in
&gt;&gt;&gt; JackLibGlobals.h)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) an additional somewhat separated issue is the use of non
&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriate API (like "sigprocmask" instead of "pthread_sigmask")
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; We should probably try to refine 1) and 2) to see if
&gt;&gt;&gt; jackctl_setup_signals and jackctl_wait_signals have to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; redesigned to be more flexible. What are the precise constraints
&gt;&gt;&gt; for jackdbus?  Nedko can you refine?
&gt;&gt;  jackdbus needs to have a loop. jackd has no loop, it calls
&gt;&gt; jackctl_wait_signals(signals). AFAICS jackctl_wait_signals() cannot
&gt;&gt; be used for jackdbus because it will block the D-Bus loop.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Maybe dbus loop can be implemented in a separate thread but I'd like
&gt;&gt; to avoid this, if possible.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; To remember: jackctl_setup_signals/ jackctl_wait_signals was designed
&gt; as a "restructuration" of jack1 initial signal code handling: the code
&gt; was just separated as 2 functions.

The signal issue is present in jack1dbus as well. Back when I proposed
the dbus.patch for jack1 and it got refused, there was absolutely no
sense to change the jack1 jackd from sigwait to a real main loop. Even
these days some people don't understand why jackdbus needs a main loop
and thus is not really compatible with jackd, from the POV of user that
tends to look in the process monitor for a process with a name that
starts with "jack".

&gt; If this API is not usable in dbus context, then either 1) you just
&gt; don't use is at all..

I had impression that this is not really an option because the threads
that jack creates will get wrong signal setup.

&gt; 2) this signal handling API has to be
&gt; redesigned to be used in different context.

I never got the information about the reasoning behind design of the
signal setup in jack1 (IIRC in jack2 it is almost the same, copied
From jack1).

&gt; I still don't have a clear view of what is the correct approach: do
&gt; you think 2) will make some sense? if yes, do you have any proposal to
&gt; change the API?

I think 2) is better but I dont know how to do it. The bad news here is
that I never got motivation to investigate how to fix the issue. Mainly
because it is not that important compared to other issues that have to
be fixed.
