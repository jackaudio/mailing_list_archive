but there seems to be some sense, to fix the control api now, for
jack-dbus. 
all that jackd cared about was that the threads it creates ignore all
signals. jack doesnt need signals. it just used SIGUSR1 to communicate
that the backend died, and shutdown is indicated.

this whole jackctl_setup_signals/ jackctl_wait_signals is completely
useless.
jackctl_server_start() needs to make sure, that the threads it creates
block all signals.
"backend died" just needs to be a callback. than any jackctl user can take
appropriate actions.

just clean up that api. 
we dont need signals in jack. 
(maybe we need to make sure that the main thread doesnt get SIGPIPE...
but its probably safer to just document, that SIGPIPE might be
generated and any jackctl user needs to either ignore them, or if it
needs them itself, needs to be prepared for spurious occurances.

yes. the stuff that jackctl_setup_signals() does, needs to be done inside 
jackctl_server_start() before it calls pthread_create() and then undone.
