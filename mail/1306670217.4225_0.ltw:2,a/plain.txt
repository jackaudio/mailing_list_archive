no. as said, there's no "quit" whatsoever, just "save_and_quit". maybe 
pyjacksm is ditching the saved data, but i doubt that's a good thing to do.

anyway, this is all torbenh's call, isn't it?

otoh, i'm the least interested into reading python code anyway :)

i wonder, just a guess, aren't you confusing this "quit" command as a 
simple pyjacksm's exit() and not as a full-fledged "quit session" at all?
