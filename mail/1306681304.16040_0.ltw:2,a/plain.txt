The issue with "just quit" is that some apps pop up a "Are you sure"
question upon quitting with *non-saved* data. So to deal with this jack
session just doesn't support it. It was mentioned that an SM could save the
session into /tmp and then just rm -rf it.

I don't like that idea, and am a strong supporter of letting the user just
save to an arbitrary place and rm -rf it themselves if they feel so
inclined. I'd happily do that 200 times, rather than losing some awesome
edits to a session, and having to try and repeat the work. :)
