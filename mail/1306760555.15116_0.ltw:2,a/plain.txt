you need a session manager *always* to start a session. if you have
one that can be used on the command line, then yes.

depends on the session manager, but i believe that torben's python
proof-of-concept will do a very basic "save state" for clients that
have no session callback. it can certainly determine all the
connections. i'm not sure how it can find out the command to start the
client.

torben will likely enlighten us.
