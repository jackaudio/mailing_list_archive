drobilla was experimenting with a tool (or addition to jack_connect)  
which would enable converting a session to a script. 
not sure how this will work out.

for pyjacksm, it would easily be possible to write a commandline client
(not sure about the state of that one, i was there at some point, but i
didnt do much work on pyjacksm recently. i dont know.

it cant find out the command. but you can configure the command in the
config file.
however, the apps wont save their state, so this only works for simple
and stateless clients.
