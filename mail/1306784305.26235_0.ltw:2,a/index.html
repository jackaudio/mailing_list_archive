&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Two usability questions:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Is it possible to start a session from the command line? How?
&gt;&gt; you need a session manager *always* to start a session. if you have
&gt;&gt; one that can be used on the command line, then yes.

More specific, it is possible to start qjackctl with a certain session, 
something like

qjackctl --session mysession.session

So you can integrate it in a bash session script for instance, to deal 
with non-supported apps, which is the problem I think about here.

&gt; drobilla was experimenting with a tool (or addition to jack_connect)
&gt; which would enable converting a session to a script.
&gt; not sure how this will work out.
&gt;
&gt; for pyjacksm, it would easily be possible to write a commandline client
&gt; (not sure about the state of that one, i was there at some point, but i
&gt; didnt do much work on pyjacksm recently. i dont know.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Is it possible to use apps without jacksession support in a JackSession?
&gt;&gt; depends on the session manager, but i believe that torben's python
&gt;&gt; proof-of-concept will do a very basic "save state" for clients that
&gt;&gt; have no session callback. it can certainly determine all the
&gt;&gt; connections. i'm not sure how it can find out the command to start the
&gt;&gt; client.
Restoring the connections would be a good thing and it would be nice if 
the apps can be started.

&gt; it cant find out the command. but you can configure the command in the
&gt; config file.
&gt; however, the apps wont save their state, so this only works for simple
&gt; and stateless clients.
Could you be a bit more specific? E.g. what can I do at the moment or in 
the near future, with non supported apps in a Jacksession (using 
qjackctl or pyjacksm). Could you give an example?
