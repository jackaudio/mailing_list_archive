More specific, it is possible to start qjackctl with a certain session, 
something like

qjackctl --session mysession.session

So you can integrate it in a bash session script for instance, to deal 
with non-supported apps, which is the problem I think about here.

Restoring the connections would be a good thing and it would be nice if 
the apps can be started.

Could you be a bit more specific? E.g. what can I do at the moment or in 
the near future, with non supported apps in a Jacksession (using 
qjackctl or pyjacksm). Could you give an example?
