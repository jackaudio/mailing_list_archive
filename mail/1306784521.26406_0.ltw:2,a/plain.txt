i'm not sure if you aware of the level of disagreement that exists in
the world of digital audio regarding the value of these scaling
factors.

JACK has the values that it does today more as a matter of default and
deference to the most authoritative argument in favor of them.
Preferences for the other arguments may change over time. I know at
least one very experienced and highly skilled digital audio programmer
(i don't believe he is on this list) who refuses to use libsndfile,
for example, because in his (very strong) opinion it makes the wrong
choice about which scaling factors to use.
