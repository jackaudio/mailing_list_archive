&gt;&gt; So, for now (October 2008) we use 2^(N-1)-1 as the scaling factor.

&gt;&gt; Which is part 1 of my point -- unless Jack promises *never* to change
&gt;&gt; this scaling strategy, it should be available for those apps that need
&gt;&gt; bit-exactness.
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK, the only point about bit-exactness is for legal purposes,
&gt; when you have to prove that some data is 'original' by comparing
&gt; its cryptographic digest to a certified one. Which means you
&gt; can't modify it in any way, and there's no point sending it
&gt; throuhg Jack.
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from that, there is nothing magical about the bit patterns
&gt; produced by an AD converter. Change the analog gain by 0.1 dB and
&gt; you get completely different samples and roundoff errors, for the
&gt; same input signal. They are neither better nor worse than the
&gt; original ones.

Well, yes and no. The bits coming off an A/D converter are what they
are, but whatever they are, the fact remains that a subsequent
undithered truncation introduces distortion. Also, A/D converters aren't
the only source of audio data - if you're processing a
beautifully-mastered recording then you might want to take some degree
of care with it.

In this regard, I don't see bit-exactness as an end in itself, but it IS
a means to guaranteeing you don't end up with needless undithered
truncations in the I/O path. As it stands, the float/int conversion
performed by JACK is one of these.

(It could be avoided of course by using a power-of-two as the scaling
factor, but from what I can gather, the majority of developers/users
value having the full numerical range [-1, 1] available above avoiding
this error)

I don't want to start a flame war, but FWIW, I will say that by some
people, and for some applications, bit-exactness IS genuinely valued,
and is genuinely valuable. I've tried arguing this point in the past
(possibly it was on the PortAudio list), but few seemed to share my view :)
