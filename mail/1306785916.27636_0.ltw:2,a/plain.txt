Yes, I am aware. I am glad you have symmetrical scaling, by the way.

That's exactly what I thought. So perhaps the scaling factor should be
query-able, so an app (a specialized one admittedly, working in a
specialized Jack graph) can behave 5 years from now as it does today.

I am of the same opinion, but sndfile is configurable (at least
nowadays) and quite convenient otherwise.
