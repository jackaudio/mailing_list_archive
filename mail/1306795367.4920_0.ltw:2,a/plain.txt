Thanks for that - I've seen that post before, actually. While I agree
with many of Bjorn's points, I do have some issues with the arguments
and have been meaning to write up a similar blog post for a while.
Perhaps I should try and get around to that. Whether anyone cares at
this point is another matter :)

I would propose that the important fact is really the semantic meanings
of sample values, in terms of their being elements of a finite field. I
need to construct a number-theoretic argument formalising the point, as
I'm sure that's correct framework for this.

Certainly, as Bjorn points out, linearity has to be the key issue.
Linearity in the mean (as would be obtained using any scaling factor
with proper dither) is sufficient for most purposes, but of course is
not as strong as the honest-to-goodness semantic equality provided by
the 2^n scaling factor.
