freewheeling means that the backend (whatever it is - ALSA, CoreAudio,
FFADO etc) no longer waits for the audio/network interface to be ready
for data, and instead simply runs the process cycle over and over,
with no realtime constraints. each client can take as long as it wants
to, nobody will be evicted AND as soon as they are all done, another
process cycle will start up.

its used for doing things like exporting data from a DAW by running it
throught the exact same data flow pathway that happens normally, but
without any issues with realtime (and more notably, the distinct
likelihood that it will actually run faster than realtime).
