&gt; &gt; I was trying to study the way Jack sever works. I was unable to understand
&gt; &gt; what Freewheel is. Let me more specific.
&gt; 
&gt; freewheeling means that the backend (whatever it is - ALSA, CoreAudio,
&gt; FFADO etc) no longer waits for the audio/network interface to be ready
&gt; for data, and instead simply runs the process cycle over and over,
&gt; with no realtime constraints. each client can take as long as it wants
&gt; to, nobody will be evicted AND as soon as they are all done, another
&gt; process cycle will start up.
&gt; 
&gt; its used for doing things like exporting data from a DAW by running it
&gt; throught the exact same data flow pathway that happens normally, but
&gt; without any issues with realtime (and more notably, the distinct
&gt; likelihood that it will actually run faster than realtime).

In that scenario (exporting data from a DAW), is it
safe to accidentaly press play on some other program and has ports
connected, and that would normally produce some audio output?
IOW, and as e.g., if doing an export on ardour, and I press play
on audacity (connected to jack), can that mess up the export?
