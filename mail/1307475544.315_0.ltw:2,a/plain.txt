In that scenario (exporting data from a DAW), is it
safe to accidentaly press play on some other program and has ports
connected, and that would normally produce some audio output?
IOW, and as e.g., if doing an export on ardour, and I press play
on audacity (connected to jack), can that mess up the export?
