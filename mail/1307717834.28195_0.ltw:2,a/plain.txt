there is another implementation strategy that i've implemented in
ardour for syncing to timecode, which is to guesstimate how long it
will take to sync, aim "ahead" by roughly half that much, wait for the
master to get within a range where ardour can do "fast sync" (i.e.
change some data pointers rather than read new data), and then do that
sync and keep going. its complex and heuristic, so i can't recommend
it.
