Yes, I guess a stop & immediate restart would accomplish exactly this.
Or perhaps a seek of +1 frame or +1 period... Either are necessarily
disruptive for other clients of course.

I've thought about the heuristic strategy too -- in fact depending on
the application it might not be too bad. And if the guesstimate turns
out to be too low, one can double it and retry.

Thanks Paul.
