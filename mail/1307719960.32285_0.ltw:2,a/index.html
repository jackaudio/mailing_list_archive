&gt; The whole slow-start system is IMHO fundamentally flawed, because
&gt; checking for readyness is done only when the transport is supposed
&gt; to have already started. This makes it impossible to start on cue,
&gt; unless you are lucky and all clients involved happen to be ready.

Presumably what you mean is explained by this next paragraph:

&gt; 1. Clients capable to catch up and sync by themselves if the transport
&gt; &#xA0; starts when they are not ready, probably outputting silence until
&gt; &#xA0; they have synced (that would also solve your case).

having implemented this in ardour, i can testify that its really quite
complex, and the slow-sync client "abstraction" is much, much easier
for most people and comes with little cost except when the locate
really is very costly (and this is rare, extremely rare).

&gt; 2. Clients that, when transport is stopped and locates to a new
&gt; &#xA0; position, get ready to start without delay at that position
&gt; &#xA0; instead of waiting for a transport start (many probably do
&gt; &#xA0; this already, but it's not required and can't be checked),

there's no reason to check it unless you believe that the check on
client-is-read-to-roll takes too long. the client will be ready the
first time the server asks if it does this (and indeed, its hard to
imagine a client that didn't - deferring an actual data i/o operation
until transport start is ... well, its braindead.

&gt; 3. A way for clients to indicate their readyness to start without
&gt; &#xA0; delay _while transport is stopped_.

necessary only if you believe the check is too slow. i can't imagine
situations where it would be too slow - if you're trying to sync with
an external timesource, you won't care about this kind of delay, i
think.
