&gt; &gt; The whole slow-start system is IMHO fundamentally flawed, because
&gt; &gt; checking for readyness is done only when the transport is supposed
&gt; &gt; to have already started. This makes it impossible to start on cue,
&gt; &gt; unless you are lucky and all clients involved happen to be ready.
&gt; 
&gt; Presumably what you mean is explained by this next paragraph:

No, not really. The next paragraph merely describes a fallback
that could be used if a client is started while it is not ready
to start.
 
&gt; &gt; 1. Clients capable to catch up and sync by themselves if the transport
&gt; &gt; &#xA0; starts when they are not ready, probably outputting silence until
&gt; &gt; &#xA0; they have synced (that would also solve your case).
&gt; 
&gt; having implemented this in ardour, i can testify that its really quite
&gt; complex, and the slow-sync client "abstraction" is much, much easier
&gt; for most people and comes with little cost except when the locate
&gt; really is very costly (and this is rare, extremely rare).

It needn't be complex. If there's no constraint on how long the
client could take to sync, it could just skip ahead say 10 seconds,
have 10 seconds to prepare itself and then start rolling at the
right moment and be in sync. Even that would in many cases be
preferred to blocking all others to start. 

&gt; &gt; 2. Clients that, when transport is stopped and locates to a new
&gt; &gt; &#xA0; position, get ready to start without delay at that position
&gt; &gt; &#xA0; instead of waiting for a transport start (many probably do
&gt; &gt; &#xA0; this already, but it's not required and can't be checked),
&gt; 
&gt; there's no reason to check it unless you believe that the check on
&gt; client-is-read-to-roll takes too long. the client will be ready the
&gt; first time the server asks if it does this (and indeed, its hard to
&gt; imagine a client that didn't - deferring an actual data i/o operation
&gt; until transport start is ... well, its braindead.

&gt; &gt; 3. A way for clients to indicate their readyness to start without
&gt; &gt; &#xA0; delay _while transport is stopped_.
&gt; 
&gt; necessary only if you believe the check is too slow. i can't imagine
&gt; situations where it would be too slow - if you're trying to sync with
&gt; an external timesource, you won't care about this kind of delay, i
&gt; think.

I agree that preparing to start (e.g. buffer the necessary data) only
when the start command arrives is sort of braindead, and I'd expect 
clients to prepare as soon as possible instead. But the point here is
that

1. The current transport system doesn't require a client to do this,
2. Not doing it is encouraged by the current system allowing clients
   to make others wait if they are not ready themselves, instead of
   forcing them to sync later if they can't start immediately (or fail).
3. There is no way for a client to report not-ready-to-start without
   actually trying to start it.

The last one is probably the most important. When under interactive
control of a human operator this sort of problem can be anticipated
and the human operator probably can handle it. This is *not* the case
in automated systems - any software controlling clients and wanting
to a) either start them exactly on cue or b) not at all if there's a
problem, would need to  know the ready-or-not state of all involved
clients *before* sending the start command. 

Adding the exra state (not ready to start without delay) does not
complicate things at all. It does NOT imply that clients should be
able to sync on their own if started in non-ready state. They could
just fail instead - these are separate issues.

 
Another SEPARATE but related issue:

Ardour's OSC control seems to have some race conditions. Making it
locate while running sometimes works, and sometimes Ardour just does
the locate and then stops. Sending a transport start immediately after
the locate doesn't help - it's ignored unless delayed by 20 ms or so.
That's just one, there seem to be more of those race conditions.

Ciao,
