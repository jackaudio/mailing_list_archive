You're kidding, right?  Everyone does mistakes once in a while.
Deleting random files for the user is always a recipe for disaster.

While not having ever used a qjackctrl with session management, I
still can't avoid asking:

Why is qjackctrl deleting a whole directory and its contents,
instead of only deleting the files it knows about, and needs to?
And then if it feels like removing the top specified directory,
do it only if the directory ends up empty?

Does qjackctrl warn you that it'll wipe everything under the
directory you specify?

Certainly a better way to avoid this nasty scenario can be
devised.
