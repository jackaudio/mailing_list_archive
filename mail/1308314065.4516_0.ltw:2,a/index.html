&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; As reported on IRC, there is a guy who seems to have lost his /home
&gt;&gt;&gt; folder by choosing /home as session folder for a session! Pyjacksm seems
&gt;&gt;&gt; to have a special folder for the sessions... wise thing...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; and this guy responded with "ok" when asked for replacing his session
&gt;&gt; directory "/home" ?... wise guy... :/
&gt;
&gt; You're kidding, right?  Everyone does mistakes once in a while.
&gt; Deleting random files for the user is always a recipe for disaster.
&gt;
&gt; While not having ever used a qjackctrl with session management, I
&gt; still can't avoid asking:
&gt;
&gt; Why is qjackctrl deleting a whole directory and its contents,
&gt; instead of only deleting the files it knows about, and needs to?
&gt; And then if it feels like removing the top specified directory,
&gt; do it only if the directory ends up empty?
&gt;
&gt; Does qjackctrl warn you that it'll wipe everything under the
&gt; directory you specify?
&gt;
&gt; Certainly a better way to avoid this nasty scenario can be
&gt; devised.
&gt;

qjackctl wipes the session directory when you are replacing a previously 
saved session directory.

i also find this outrageous but the root of the danger, so to speak, is 
*inside* the jack-session save logic and not in qjackctl.

afaic, jack (and not qjackctl) expects an empty session directory when 
saving clients states, otherwise it will fail.

one could ask why jack expects an empty session directory in the first 
place, and yes i've argued about that long ago on #jack irc. the 
argument for was that it would be a greater "danger" if it would be 
allowed to leave cruft/dead state data under the session directories. i 
just thought to my self, who cares? alas, destroying data was the argued 
solution and boy was i disgruntled too (*grin*)

and yes, qjackctl prompts the user whether he/she really wants to 
replace an existing non-empty session directory.

cheers
