qjackctl wipes the session directory when you are replacing a previously 
saved session directory.

i also find this outrageous but the root of the danger, so to speak, is 
*inside* the jack-session save logic and not in qjackctl.

afaic, jack (and not qjackctl) expects an empty session directory when 
saving clients states, otherwise it will fail.

one could ask why jack expects an empty session directory in the first 
place, and yes i've argued about that long ago on #jack irc. the 
argument for was that it would be a greater "danger" if it would be 
allowed to leave cruft/dead state data under the session directories. i 
just thought to my self, who cares? alas, destroying data was the argued 
solution and boy was i disgruntled too (*grin*)

and yes, qjackctl prompts the user whether he/she really wants to 
replace an existing non-empty session directory.

cheers
