well... you just start it ?
via commandline or icon or whatever.

if you save a session, it will be saved, if its running while you save
the session. Thats like with all normal jack-session clients too.
the only special thing about infra clients is that they are singletons.
there can be only one. so if its already running while you load a
session, there wont be another instance, the already running instance
will be connected to.


NOTE that jacksmdaemon only reads its configfile when its started.
it will continue to run even if you kill jackd, and jacksmtray.

So you better make sure, that it doesnt run, if you change the
configfile and expect something to happen.
