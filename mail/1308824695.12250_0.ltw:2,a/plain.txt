Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack_ringbuffer_create size

Hi,

no big deal, but I see that jack_ringbuffer_create() treats the passed
size only as a hint and always allocates power-of-2's. In this case
the documentation should state that it "allocates a ringbuffer data
structure of AT LEAST the specified size", and perhaps there should be
a function to query the actual ringbuffer size. The actual size can be
measured using write_space() + 1 right after creation, of course, but
that means depending on implementation details.
