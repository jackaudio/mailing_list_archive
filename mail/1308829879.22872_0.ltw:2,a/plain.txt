Ah useful information! :)

It seems to work as expected. It looks like you can have infra clients 
in .pyjacksmrc without necessarily using them, which is a good thing imo.

Only comments about jacksmtray is that you can't stop a session without 
saving it. Moreover it saves it automatically when you quit a session 
without telling you that it is actually saving.

Also useful would be to have a button in jacksmtray to stop jacksmtray 
and maybe even to stop/ restart jacksmdaemon.

So far so good. Thanks for your work!
