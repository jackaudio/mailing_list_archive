you can tell the jackdbus process to quit by executing
"jack_control exit". laditools (laditray) and gladish have menu items
for doing it as well. if jackdbus is not responsive, you will have to
kill the process with SIGKILL, by executing "killall -9 jackdbus" for
example. If mandriva does not have "killall", then you will have to use
"kill" and find the actual jackdbus pid.

jackdbus process being started does not mean that jack server is
started. you can check whether jack server is started by executing
"jack_control status". to stop the server, use "jack_control stop". to
start the jack server, use "jack_control start". laditools provides a
mean to start/stop the jack server through a GUI menu. ladish provides a
mean to start/stop jack server by starting/stopping the currently loaded
ladish "studio".
