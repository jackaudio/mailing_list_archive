JACK 0.121.0 is now available at:

    http://jackaudio.org/downloads/jack-audio-connection-kit-0.121.0.tar.gz

It contains a couple of important bug fixes, a small but
nice new piece of functionality, and some unfinished work.

FIXES

    * Fix memory overrun when calling jack_get_ports() with
      arguments that lead it to return all existing ports.

    * Remove client-&gt;control-&gt;nframes data element and use
      control-&gt;engine-&gt;buffer_size. This fixes erroneous
      behaviour when trying to get the buffer size
      associated with JACK port types.

CHANGES

    * More relaxed zombification rules: clients will only be
      zombified if they consume more than 1 period of time
      by themselves. Suppose the period duration is 10msec,
      and there are two clients. If each client takes 6
      msec, then JACK will run with continual xruns, even
      though neither client is taking "too long" on its
      own. With the old rules, one of the clients (which one
      is not defined) will be zombified to try to allow JACK
      to operate without xruns. With the new rules, neither
      client will be zombified, since neither one of them is
      doing anything wrong.

    * Continuous xrun "timeout": designed for use in
      conjuction with the new zombification rules, the -C
      flag can now be passed to the server with an argument
      that specifies a number of milliseconds. If used, JACK
      will stop processing clients if it cannot complete the
      process cycle in time (typically caused by CPU
      overloading or misbehaved clients). The optional time
      argument specifies the number of miliseconds, during
      which consectutive process cycles must fail before
      JACK gives up (if the argument is not given, it
      defaults to 250). Processing will resume on the next
      change to the port graph (i.e. a port is added,
      removed, connected or disconnected)

    * There are also changes in the code to support the
      control API and slave drivers, features previously
      found only in JACK2, but this work is not finished at
      this time. However, it has already made possible ...

    * jackd.py .. a new "wrapper" around the regular JACK
      server that uses the control API to start, stop and
      reconfigure the server. This includes dynamically
      changing the backend in use (both the device and the
      backend used to support it). jackd.py also has support
      for D-Bus and can interact with PulseAudio to
      "correctly" share the audio device on Linux. At this
      time, jackd.py is still a command line prototype, and
      is totally undocumented. However, it does illustrate
      how to provide all this functionality in the way that
      was originally envisaged when the control API was
      designed, and can act as the basis for improved
      versions, including perhaps a "systray"
      widget/controller.

Almost all of the work in this release was done by Torben Hohn. Thanks
to David Robillard for noticing the memory overrun.
