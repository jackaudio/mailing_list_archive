Your message doesn't mention which version of JACK you are running on
your new machine, or which version of JACK you ran on your old
machine.  That data might be helpful.

If your period size is smaller than the amount of messages retrieved
from your ringbuffer during a process call, then your timestamp (i /
MidiMessageSize) will become out-of-bounds.  However, at least with
JACK 2, the error wouldn't increment the lost event count.

With JACK 2, events may be considered "lost" 1.) during mixdown, when
two or more MIDI buffers are having their contents transferred to
another MIDI buffer and a MIDI message can't be transferred to the
MIDI buffer, and 2.) when space cannot be reserved in the MIDI buffer
for your event when calling 'jack_midi_event_write' or
'jack_midi_event_reserve'.  You can find the relevant code here:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/trunk/jackmp/common/JackMidiAPI.cpp

... and here:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/trunk/jackmp/common/JackMidiPort.cpp

The second case is the only case that matters in this situation, as
you're calling 'jack_midi_clear_buffer' on the output buffer at the
beginning of every process call, which will reset the lost event count
to zero. You can check for the second case by checking if the return
value of 'jack_midi_event_write' is -ENOBUFS.

FYI, 'jack_ringbuffer_reset' is not thread-safe.  Calling it in a
process callback is probably a bad idea.
