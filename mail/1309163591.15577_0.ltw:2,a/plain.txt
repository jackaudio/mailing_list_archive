Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Mixed Windows / Linux system

Dear list,


I would like to use Hauptwerk on a powerful Core i7 Windows PC. Computers
with this performance level are costly and noisy, so I would like to use my
small Ubuntu netbook at the keyboard, have its MIDI output sent over the LAN
to the Windows PC and have Hauptwerk digest it. The output of Hauptwerk, in
turn, must be sent back to the netbook. The resulting setup would be dead
quiet at the keyboard. Good.

Initially, I played with the option of USBIP exposing the USB MIDI interface
and an USB soundcard to the Windows PC directly, but I failed to properly
export any USB device but a memory stick.

So I was thinking of using Jack. I got 1.9.7 running on the netbook and
installed 1.9.7. on the Windows machine (which runs VIsta Ultimate 64-bit).

It doesn't work, but I think that is mostly due to me. Therefore, I have
summarized these questions:

1. Is it correct that the setup with the audio output (i.e. the Linux
netbook) must be the master ?

2. I end up with the master (Linux netbook) running 'jackd -dalsa' and
'jack_netsource -H 192.168.16.101', and the slave (Windows PC - IP
192.168.16.101) running 'jackd -dnet'. The master's jack_netsource says 'Not
connected' and the slave ends up saying 'Waiting for a master...'. Is this a
normal status ? How can I tell if the system works at the link layer level ?
Must I run 'jack_load netmanager' perhaps ? (BTW I seem to be unable to
launch the jackd server in Windows from Jack Control, so I start it from a
Command Prompt window.)

3. I think it would be more useful for you that I use 1.9.8. I can install
the test version on the Windows PC, but I have no ubuntu package for 1.9.8.
I did get the SVN source for 1.9.8, but I do not seem to find any build
instructions (such as ./configure and make, which don't work). Running the
1.9.8 Windows slave with the 1.9.7. Linux master seems to produce protocol
incompatibility errors on the master (in qjackctl's message window). Is
building Jack 1.9.8 a sensible thing to do ?

4. I need to patch the netbook's MIDI interface and hw:0 device into Jack.
What's the procedure (running jackd, patchbay, connect - which one first, is
input and output referring to the local jackd) for this ?

5. What do I need to patch into the Windows slave. I think I can't use ASIO,
as I'm using the 'net' backend. How do I connect the virtual MIDI and audio
to Hauptwerk ? Is this where VST comes in ?

I'm willing to do (at least Linux) software builds, test and report but I
fear I need your help to understand the system architecture.

TIA,


Jeroen.
