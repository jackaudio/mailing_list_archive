Hi Jeroen,

Just to summarize - you'd like to use JackNet to pipe MIDI from your
Ubuntu netbook through to your Windows Vista Ultimate (64-bit) Jack
for Windows -&gt; Hauptwerk (are you running HW in 32-bit or 64-bit??)
and then pipe the resulting Audio out from Hauptwerk -&gt; NetJack to
your Ubunut netbook Jack system?

I'm asking this for clarity for other users as I have not used Netjack
so can't help with those specifics.

2) I have to start Jackd from the command prompt in Windows too, so
that is expected behavior until such time and Qjackctl catches up with
some of the windows development.

3) If you are using Hauptwerk in 64-bit, then you will not be able to
connect the audio out from HW to Jack 1.9.7 and you will need 1.9.8

4) For Ubuntu I would suggest using Jack Control to automatically run
jackd and load a patchbay configured with the various connections
needed.

You will also need 'virtual midi cables' or software midi cables to
connect HW to Jack - I suggest you take a look at loopMidi
(http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/loopMIDI.html) as it supports 64-bit
Windows.

Sorry I can't help more as I have not yet tried a setup like this...

&gt; Dear list,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I would like to use Hauptwerk on a powerful Core i7 Windows PC. Computers
&gt; with this performance level are costly and noisy, so I would like to use my
&gt; small Ubuntu netbook at the keyboard, have its MIDI output sent over the LAN
&gt; to the Windows PC and have Hauptwerk digest it. The output of Hauptwerk, in
&gt; turn, must be sent back to the netbook. The resulting setup would be dead
&gt; quiet at the keyboard. Good.
&gt;
&gt; Initially, I played with the option of USBIP exposing the USB MIDI interface
&gt; and an USB soundcard to the Windows PC directly, but I failed to properly
&gt; export any USB device but a memory stick.
&gt;
&gt; So I was thinking of using Jack. I got 1.9.7 running on the netbook and
&gt; installed 1.9.7. on the Windows machine (which runs VIsta Ultimate 64-bit).
&gt;
&gt; It doesn't work, but I think that is mostly due to me. Therefore, I have
&gt; summarized these questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is it correct that the setup with the audio output (i.e. the Linux
&gt; netbook) must be the master ?
&gt;
&gt; 2. I end up with the master (Linux netbook) running 'jackd -dalsa' and
&gt; 'jack_netsource -H 192.168.16.101', and the slave (Windows PC - IP
&gt; 192.168.16.101) running 'jackd -dnet'. The master's jack_netsource says 'Not
&gt; connected' and the slave ends up saying 'Waiting for a master...'. Is this a
&gt; normal status ? How can I tell if the system works at the link layer level ?
&gt; Must I run 'jack_load netmanager' perhaps ? (BTW I seem to be unable to
&gt; launch the jackd server in Windows from Jack Control, so I start it from a
&gt; Command Prompt window.)
&gt;
&gt; 3. I think it would be more useful for you that I use 1.9.8. I can install
&gt; the test version on the Windows PC, but I have no ubuntu package for 1.9.8.
&gt; I did get the SVN source for 1.9.8, but I do not seem to find any build
&gt; instructions (such as ./configure and make, which don't work). Running the
&gt; 1.9.8 Windows slave with the 1.9.7. Linux master seems to produce protocol
&gt; incompatibility errors on the master (in qjackctl's message window). Is
&gt; building Jack 1.9.8 a sensible thing to do ?
&gt;
&gt; 4. I need to patch the netbook's MIDI interface and hw:0 device into Jack.
&gt; What's the procedure (running jackd, patchbay, connect - which one first, is
&gt; input and output referring to the local jackd) for this ?
&gt;
&gt; 5. What do I need to patch into the Windows slave. I think I can't use ASIO,
&gt; as I'm using the 'net' backend. How do I connect the virtual MIDI and audio
&gt; to Hauptwerk ? Is this where VST comes in ?
&gt;
&gt; I'm willing to do (at least Linux) software builds, test and report but I
&gt; fear I need your help to understand the system architecture.
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Jeroen.
