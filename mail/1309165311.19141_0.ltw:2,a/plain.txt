Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Mixed Windows / Linux system

Hi Jeroen,

Just to summarize - you'd like to use JackNet to pipe MIDI from your
Ubuntu netbook through to your Windows Vista Ultimate (64-bit) Jack
for Windows -> Hauptwerk (are you running HW in 32-bit or 64-bit??)
and then pipe the resulting Audio out from Hauptwerk -> NetJack to
your Ubunut netbook Jack system?

I'm asking this for clarity for other users as I have not used Netjack
so can't help with those specifics.

2) I have to start Jackd from the command prompt in Windows too, so
that is expected behavior until such time and Qjackctl catches up with
some of the windows development.

3) If you are using Hauptwerk in 64-bit, then you will not be able to
connect the audio out from HW to Jack 1.9.7 and you will need 1.9.8

4) For Ubuntu I would suggest using Jack Control to automatically run
jackd and load a patchbay configured with the various connections
needed.

You will also need 'virtual midi cables' or software midi cables to
connect HW to Jack - I suggest you take a look at loopMidi
(http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/loopMIDI.html) as it supports 64-bit
Windows.

Sorry I can't help more as I have not yet tried a setup like this...
