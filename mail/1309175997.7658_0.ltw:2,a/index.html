&gt; Dear list,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to use Hauptwerk on a powerful Core i7 Windows PC. Computers
&gt; with this performance level are costly and noisy, so I would like to use my
&gt; small Ubuntu netbook at the keyboard, have its MIDI output sent over the LAN
&gt; to the Windows PC and have Hauptwerk digest it. The output of Hauptwerk, in
&gt; turn, must be sent back to the netbook. The resulting setup would be dead
&gt; quiet at the keyboard. Good.
&gt; 
&gt; Initially, I played with the option of USBIP exposing the USB MIDI interface
&gt; and an USB soundcard to the Windows PC directly, but I failed to properly
&gt; export any USB device but a memory stick.
&gt; 
&gt; So I was thinking of using Jack. I got 1.9.7 running on the netbook and
&gt; installed 1.9.7. on the Windows machine (which runs VIsta Ultimate 64-bit).
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn't work, but I think that is mostly due to me. Therefore, I have
&gt; summarized these questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is it correct that the setup with the audio output (i.e. the Linux
&gt; netbook) must be the master ?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. I end up with the master (Linux netbook) running 'jackd -dalsa' and
&gt; 'jack_netsource -H 192.168.16.101', and the slave (Windows PC - IP
&gt; 192.168.16.101) running 'jackd -dnet'. The master's jack_netsource says 'Not
&gt; connected' and the slave ends up saying 'Waiting for a master...'. Is this a
&gt; normal status ? How can I tell if the system works at the link layer level ?
&gt; Must I run 'jack_load netmanager' perhaps ? (BTW I seem to be unable to
&gt; launch the jackd server in Windows from Jack Control, so I start it from a
&gt; Command Prompt window.)

on jack2 -dnet means netjack2
on linux your are using jack_netsource, which is netjack1
so either use jack2 -d netone
or do jack_load netmanager on linux, so you have netjack2

if you have jack1 on linux you only have netjack1

&gt; 
&gt; 3. I think it would be more useful for you that I use 1.9.8. I can install
&gt; the test version on the Windows PC, but I have no ubuntu package for 1.9.8.
&gt; I did get the SVN source for 1.9.8, but I do not seem to find any build
&gt; instructions (such as ./configure and make, which don't work). Running the
&gt; 1.9.8 Windows slave with the 1.9.7. Linux master seems to produce protocol
&gt; incompatibility errors on the master (in qjackctl's message window). Is
&gt; building Jack 1.9.8 a sensible thing to do ?
&gt; 
&gt; 4. I need to patch the netbook's MIDI interface and hw:0 device into Jack.
&gt; What's the procedure (running jackd, patchbay, connect - which one first, is
&gt; input and output referring to the local jackd) for this ?
&gt; 
&gt; 5. What do I need to patch into the Windows slave. I think I can't use ASIO,
&gt; as I'm using the 'net' backend. How do I connect the virtual MIDI and audio
&gt; to Hauptwerk ? Is this where VST comes in ?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm willing to do (at least Linux) software builds, test and report but I
&gt; fear I need your help to understand the system architecture.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jeroen.
