 Hello Graham,



&gt; Just to summarize - you'd like to use JackNet to pipe MIDI from your
&gt; Ubuntu netbook through to your Windows Vista Ultimate (64-bit) Jack
&gt; for Windows -&gt; Hauptwerk (are you running HW in 32-bit or 64-bit??)
&gt; and then pipe the resulting Audio out from Hauptwerk -&gt; NetJack to
&gt; your Ubunut netbook Jack system?


Correct. I've installed 64-bit HW.


&gt; I'm asking this for clarity for other users as I have not used Netjack
&gt; so can't help with those specifics.
&gt;
Well, my problem is that Netjack is apparently merged into Jack now.


&gt; 2) I have to start Jackd from the command prompt in Windows too, so
&gt; that is expected behavior until such time and Qjackctl catches up with
&gt; some of the windows development.
&gt;

Aha. Good to hear that. Is it also acceptable to have three 'Not a
driver' .dll error codes with return value 127 ?


&gt;
&gt; 3) If you are using Hauptwerk in 64-bit, then you will not be able to
&gt; connect the audio out from HW to Jack 1.9.7 and you will need 1.9.8


In that case I will need to build Jack 1.9.8 from SVN and I still need some
hints on how to do that: I can't seem to manage to produce a Makefile for
the build.


&gt; 4) For Ubuntu I would suggest using Jack Control to automatically run
&gt; jackd and load a patchbay configured with the various connections
&gt; needed.
&gt;

In fact, I have serious difficulty understanding the concepts behind the
patchbay, connect and session windows. Anywhere I can find this explained ?
The jackaudio.org documentation was no help to me.

As far as I understand now, it would be sufficient to use the Connect box.


&gt; I suggest you take a look at loopMidi
&gt; (http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/loopMIDI.html) as it supports 64-bit
&gt; Windows.
&gt;

Thanks a lot for this link.


&gt; Sorry I can't help more as I have not yet tried a setup like this...
&gt;

I'm still a bit confused over the Windows PC configuration I have to make
with HW.

What input and output device do I have to use in HW ? What drivers
(JackRouter, ASIO, loopMIDI) should I load ? Do I need WinMME ?

The problem is: I have understood that, when using the 'net' backend, I
cannot use local physical audio resources and I'm unclear if the JackRouter
is one of them (or whether JackRouter is only available with the 'portaudio'
backend).


Jeroen.
