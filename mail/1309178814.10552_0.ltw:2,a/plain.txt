 Hello Graham,

Correct. I've installed 64-bit HW.

Well, my problem is that Netjack is apparently merged into Jack now.

Aha. Good to hear that. Is it also acceptable to have three 'Not a
driver' .dll error codes with return value 127 ?

In that case I will need to build Jack 1.9.8 from SVN and I still need some
hints on how to do that: I can't seem to manage to produce a Makefile for
the build.

In fact, I have serious difficulty understanding the concepts behind the
patchbay, connect and session windows. Anywhere I can find this explained ?
The jackaudio.org documentation was no help to me.

As far as I understand now, it would be sufficient to use the Connect box.

Thanks a lot for this link.

I'm still a bit confused over the Windows PC configuration I have to make
with HW.

What input and output device do I have to use in HW ? What drivers
(JackRouter, ASIO, loopMIDI) should I load ? Do I need WinMME ?

The problem is: I have understood that, when using the 'net' backend, I
cannot use local physical audio resources and I'm unclear if the JackRouter
is one of them (or whether JackRouter is only available with the 'portaudio'
backend).


Jeroen.
