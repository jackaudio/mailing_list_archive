Hi Jeroen,

In order to be able to map the Windows MIDI ports you will need to
start Jack with the 'winmme' option.

For example:
jackd.exe -v -R -S -X winmme -d portaudio -p 512 -d "ASIO::Saffire
1394 ASIO x64"

Then, in Hauptwerk you must use 'JackRouter' as the Audio device as is
this what sends the audio signal to the Jack Audio Connection Kit
server. You also need to use the loopMIDI port in Hauptwerk and then
map it using Jack Control MIDI panel.

JackRouter brings the Audio into the Jack Audio Server.... using the
-X winmme option captures the MIDI. The winmme option is only
available in the latest 1.9.8 testing versions...

Hope that helps (and that I got it correct myself!)

&gt;  Hello Graham,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just to summarize - you'd like to use JackNet to pipe MIDI from your
&gt;&gt; Ubuntu netbook through to your Windows Vista Ultimate (64-bit) Jack
&gt;&gt; for Windows -&gt; Hauptwerk (are you running HW in 32-bit or 64-bit??)
&gt;&gt; and then pipe the resulting Audio out from Hauptwerk -&gt; NetJack to
&gt;&gt; your Ubunut netbook Jack system?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Correct. I've installed 64-bit HW.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm asking this for clarity for other users as I have not used Netjack
&gt;&gt; so can't help with those specifics.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Well, my problem is that Netjack is apparently merged into Jack now.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2) I have to start Jackd from the command prompt in Windows too, so
&gt;&gt; that is expected behavior until such time and Qjackctl catches up with
&gt;&gt; some of the windows development.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Aha. Good to hear that. Is it also acceptable to have three 'Not a
&gt; driver' .dll error codes with return value 127 ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3) If you are using Hauptwerk in 64-bit, then you will not be able to
&gt;&gt; connect the audio out from HW to Jack 1.9.7 and you will need 1.9.8
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In that case I will need to build Jack 1.9.8 from SVN and I still need some
&gt; hints on how to do that: I can't seem to manage to produce a Makefile for
&gt; the build.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4) For Ubuntu I would suggest using Jack Control to automatically run
&gt;&gt; jackd and load a patchbay configured with the various connections
&gt;&gt; needed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In fact, I have serious difficulty understanding the concepts behind the
&gt; patchbay, connect and session windows. Anywhere I can find this explained ?
&gt; The jackaudio.org documentation was no help to me.
&gt;
&gt; As far as I understand now, it would be sufficient to use the Connect box.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I suggest you take a look at loopMidi
&gt;&gt; (http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/loopMIDI.html) as it supports 64-bit
&gt;&gt; Windows.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks a lot for this link.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry I can't help more as I have not yet tried a setup like this...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm still a bit confused over the Windows PC configuration I have to make
&gt; with HW.
&gt;
&gt; What input and output device do I have to use in HW ? What drivers
&gt; (JackRouter, ASIO, loopMIDI) should I load ? Do I need WinMME ?
&gt;
&gt; The problem is: I have understood that, when using the 'net' backend, I
&gt; cannot use local physical audio resources and I'm unclear if the JackRouter
&gt; is one of them (or whether JackRouter is only available with the 'portaudio'
&gt; backend).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Jeroen.
