Hi Jeroen,

In order to be able to map the Windows MIDI ports you will need to
start Jack with the 'winmme' option.

For example:
jackd.exe -v -R -S -X winmme -d portaudio -p 512 -d "ASIO::Saffire
1394 ASIO x64"

Then, in Hauptwerk you must use 'JackRouter' as the Audio device as is
this what sends the audio signal to the Jack Audio Connection Kit
server. You also need to use the loopMIDI port in Hauptwerk and then
map it using Jack Control MIDI panel.

JackRouter brings the Audio into the Jack Audio Server.... using the
-X winmme option captures the MIDI. The winmme option is only
available in the latest 1.9.8 testing versions...

Hope that helps (and that I got it correct myself!)
