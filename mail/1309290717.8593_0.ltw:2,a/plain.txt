I managed to compile jackd2 1.9.8 from SVN 4473. I removed the Ubuntu 11.04
jackd2 package so I could register the shared libraries.

I regret to inform Torben that netjack1 on Windows does not connect, whereas
netjack2 does.

I now have two questions:

1. How do I get qjackctl installed in Ubuntu, without having jackd (1.9.7)
installed as well ? (or maybe: how do I replace an installed jackd2 1.9.7
with 1.9.8)

2. I would like to resolve the 'Initing net driver fails...' problem. Any
clues for where to look ? What toolchain do I need to build (looks like
Code::Blocks is needed) ?

Thanks for your help.
