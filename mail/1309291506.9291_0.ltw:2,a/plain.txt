Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack_client_close error...

With libjack2, I've noticed that jack_client_close returns nonzero
(error) when running the "temporary" server.  As far as I can tell
(which is probably not all that far), this is because the method for
quitting is to throw a JackTemporaryException, which is then caught,
the server is quit, and a nonzero error code is returned.  Is this
expected behavior?  When running the temporary server, is there a way
to tell the difference between normal server quit and an actual error
(like a broken socket) on close?

Cheers,

Evan
