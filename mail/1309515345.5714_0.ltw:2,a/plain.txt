Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [ANN] QjackCtl 0.3.8 released!

Howdy!

JACK Session versioning is quite simply the most interesting new feature 
for this release. It's optional but enabled by default. One can just 
turn it off and keep the bad old take-no-prisoners behavior :)

Never is too late,

   QjackCtl 0.3.8 has been released!

Enjoy.

Change-log:

- Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.
- Session "Save" button now a drop-down menu, replacing the session save 
type combo-box/drop-down list selection. Also, an early session 
directory versioning/numbering scheme is now in place, although optional.
- Probable fix to debian bug report #624198 - segfault when pressing the 
stop button (by Grant Adrian Diffey, after a patch from Adrian Knoth, 
thanks).
- Desktop environment session shutdown (eg. logout) is now tapped for 
graceful application exit, even though the main window is active 
(visible) and minimizing to system tray is enabled. Both were causing 
first shutdown/logout attempt to abort. Not anymore, hopefully ;).
- Make sure all activated patchbay definition files are in their 
complete and absolute directory path forms.
- Connections refresh button now does an immediate and true 
reconstruction of all clients and their respective ports and 
connections, unconditionally.
- Command line server start option (-s, --start) is now made independent 
from configuration setup option (cf. Setup/Misc /Start JACK audio server 
on application startup).
- Now handling cable socket types properly to let patchbay definitions 
work correctly, whenever having sockets with the very same literal name 
(twisted from patch #3183467, by Karsten, thanks;).
- Abrupt focus behavior when any of the keyboard modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, 
Alt, Caps Lock) is hit while on Connections client/port aliases editing 
(rename) has been fixed.
- Russian (ru) translation updated (by Alexandre Prokoudine).
- Added include "errno.h" alegedly missing for BSD style systems 
(applying patch for bug #3126091).

Cheers && Enjoy
