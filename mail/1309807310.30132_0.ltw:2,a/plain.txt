agreed. but that page is an introductory one. for basic processing, no
locks are needed. i don't doubt for a second that are scenarios where
locks are required, but trying to describe this on a page aimed at
someone who doesn't really understand JACK (or the basic concepts it
is using) seems like a mistake.

trying to describe it at all is tricky, because it *is* tricky to even
know for sure if you need them.
