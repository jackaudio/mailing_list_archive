Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK 1.9.8 targets / MIDI Driver status?

Hey all,

I've been running with the 20110509 release of jack2 for windows for a while
now and, apart from the rather noisy diagnostics when not passing "-X WinMME",
I've not hit any problems in general use.

Is there anywhere tracking outstanding tasks before release I can follow?  I've
time on my hands right now, so if there's anything I can do, I'd like to know
where my efforts are best expended.

Thanks,

-- Pete
