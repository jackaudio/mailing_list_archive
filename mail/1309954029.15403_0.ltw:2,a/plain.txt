Hi,

One thing I noticed when launching two instances of Rakarrack, the 
second one makes connections to JACK automatically (I think I turned 
this off when lauching Rakarrack the first time). As Torben pointed out:

"a jack session client is not supposed to do any connections itself.
if a flag to disable it already exist, just include this flag in the
jack-session reply."


I got into problems when launching two instances of Rakarrack with JACK2 
(with disable autoconnect patch by Nedko for Ladish). Jack freezes etc.
With Jack1 I don't have the freeze problems.

There was also a Yoshimi - Jack-Rack session which didn't load with 
JACK2. I tried to make a new session, but it didn't load. Making a new 
version with Jack1, yoshimi and jack-rack, did load ok, so I switched to 
Jack1.

Regards,
