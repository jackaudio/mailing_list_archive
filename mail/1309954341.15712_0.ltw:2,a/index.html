&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have recently added jack session support to rakarrack ...   I was check with jack1 ...and  session is restored perfectly even if I use a lot of rakarrack instances with others apps .... but ... I have problems with jack2 ... if I use more than one instance of rakarrack ... sometimes works ... but most times some instances of rakarrack are unable to open jack client ...  believe me I changed everything to try to fix but I really don't know why that happens .... you know me I'm not a programmer ..  :-(
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If someone can tell me something about how to fix that I will really appreciate :-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I use debian with the lastest svn jackmp installed in /usr/local .. also I have the jack1 debian package installed in /usr ..  I dont know if that can be a problem ...  anyway the jack2 server runs perfect ... in fact normally I use jack2 because runs better on my computer ... and of course I can open manually all the rakarrack instances I want ....
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I noticed when launching two instances of Rakarrack, the second one makes connections to JACK automatically (I think I turned this off when lauching Rakarrack the first time). As Torben pointed out:
&gt; 
&gt; "a jack session client is not supposed to do any connections itself.
&gt; if a flag to disable it already exist, just include this flag in the
&gt; jack-session reply."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I got into problems when launching two instances of Rakarrack with JACK2 (with disable autoconnect patch by Nedko for Ladish). Jack freezes etc.
&gt; With Jack1 I don't have the freeze problems.
&gt; 
&gt; There was also a Yoshimi - Jack-Rack session which didn't load with JACK2. I tried to make a new session, but it didn't load. Making a new version with Jack1, yoshimi and jack-rack, did load ok, so I switched to Jack1.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; \r

It would be interested to know is this is a "jack session" in JACK2 specific issue. Can you possibly debug the "freeze" and see in what part of the code it happens?

Thanks

St&#xE9;phane
