If would be interesting to know if MMCSS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Class_Scheduler_Service version) helps a bit for Real Time performance.

The code for thread management now activates MMCSS if priority (the -P parameter) is more that 90. 

So you could possibly try to use -P over 90 (in QjackCtl or in a terminal when launching jackd) then is the system support MMCSS "MMCSS API used to acquire RT for thread" will be printed.

It would to see if they are less XRuns with this mode especially with small buffer size.
