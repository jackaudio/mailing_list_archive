Hi, I think this depends on the fact that only the first instance of
rakarrack uses your personal configuration file... ever noticed how if
you change theme colors and you launch multiple instances only the first
will have the new colors?

And in the default configuration file there's the Autoconnect feature
turned on (under the Jack tab in Preferences IIRC).

Just noticed this today too... would it be possible that all instances
use the same configuration file? 

Also as rosea points out, maybe a better default for the Autoconnect
would be off 

cheers
