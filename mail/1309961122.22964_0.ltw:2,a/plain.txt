Hi Guys,

Just a quick question in regard to Jack2 in Windows - I've told
everyone I'm in contact to start jackd from a command line before
starting Jack Control as I've not been able to successfully select the
audio device from within Jack Control before staring the jack server.

Has anyone been able to successfully start the Jack server from within
Jack Control?

(and David, did that Windows tutorial ever go live on the Wiki?)

Kind regards,
GrahamG
