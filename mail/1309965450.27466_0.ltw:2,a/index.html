Hi Graham,

&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Just a quick question in regard to Jack2 in Windows - I've told
&gt; everyone I'm in contact to start jackd from a command line before
&gt; starting Jack Control as I've not been able to successfully select the
&gt; audio device from within Jack Control before staring the jack server.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone been able to successfully start the Jack server from within
&gt; Jack Control?

I was about to agree and say I've had no luck and have a separate start menu
option for the server (which I do).  I thought I'd try qJackCtl again.  And, er
um, it worked!
&gt; 16:04:06.083 jackd.exe -R -S -P 91 -X winmme -R -dportaudio -d"ASIO::ASIO Echo FireWire" -r48000 -p256

In setup, I have "Server path" as "jackd.exe -R -S -P 91 -X winmme", Driver as
"portaudio" and Interface as "\"ASIO::ASIO Echo FireWire\"" (pardon the
quotes!), with Frames/Period "256" and Sample Rate "48000".  With a start delay
of 4 seconds, it even managed to run "jack_load netmanager" successfully.

This is with the 9th May JACK2 installer version of qJackCtl - I've not picked
up any later versions.  I thought I'd previously tested it and had still
experienced problems with it passing the portaudio device name.  Perhaps it's
because I've turned on aliases?

&gt; 
&gt; (and David, did that Windows tutorial ever go live on the Wiki?)
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; GrahamG
&gt;
