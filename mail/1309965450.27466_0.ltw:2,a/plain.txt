I was about to agree and say I've had no luck and have a separate start menu
option for the server (which I do).  I thought I'd try qJackCtl again.  And, er
um, it worked!

In setup, I have "Server path" as "jackd.exe -R -S -P 91 -X winmme", Driver as
"portaudio" and Interface as "\"ASIO::ASIO Echo FireWire\"" (pardon the
quotes!), with Frames/Period "256" and Sample Rate "48000".  With a start delay
of 4 seconds, it even managed to run "jack_load netmanager" successfully.

This is with the 9th May JACK2 installer version of qJackCtl - I've not picked
up any later versions.  I thought I'd previously tested it and had still
experienced problems with it passing the portaudio device name.  Perhaps it's
because I've turned on aliases?
