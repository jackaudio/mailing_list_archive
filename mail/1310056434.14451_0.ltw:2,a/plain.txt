Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK 2 crashes after a long time?

I've had limited ability to test this in detail.

Last year when I was playing with convolution reverb to augment a room's 
acoustics, I found that JACK 2 would crash after 8 -9 hours of 
operation. The computer would lock up hard and would not respond to 
anything but the reset button.

Last night I thought I would check to see if it still did this, and was 
astonished to find my computer still working after 14 hours and 15 
minutes! And within seconds of moving the mouse, the computer froze.

I realize super-long sessions are probably not common, but at some point 
in the future I'm going to want to use Ardour to record uninterrupted 
multi-day sessions, so I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to 
chase this down and resolve it?

Thanks,
