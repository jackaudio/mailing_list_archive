&gt; I've had limited ability to test this in detail.
&gt;
&gt; Last year when I was playing with convolution reverb to augment a room's
&gt; acoustics, I found that JACK 2 would crash after 8 -9 hours of operation.
&gt; The computer would lock up hard and would not respond to anything but the
&gt; reset button.
&gt;
&gt; Last night I thought I would check to see if it still did this, and was
&gt; astonished to find my computer still working after 14 hours and 15 minutes!
&gt; And within seconds of moving the mouse, the computer froze.
&gt;
&gt; I realize super-long sessions are probably not common, but at some point in
&gt; the future I'm going to want to use Ardour to record uninterrupted multi-day
&gt; sessions, so I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to chase this down
&gt; and resolve it?

i have no specific data or suggestions, but i will say that my
hand-wavy gut-instinct is that this sort of thing tends to be often
associated with the ALSA device driver as much as with JACK. you've
got some (very painful) debugging ahead of you.

for whatever its worth (not much) i run jack1 on my machine typically
for 4-7 days at a time (RME HDSP interface), occasionally longer.
