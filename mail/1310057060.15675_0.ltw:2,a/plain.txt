i have no specific data or suggestions, but i will say that my
hand-wavy gut-instinct is that this sort of thing tends to be often
associated with the ALSA device driver as much as with JACK. you've
got some (very painful) debugging ahead of you.

for whatever its worth (not much) i run jack1 on my machine typically
for 4-7 days at a time (RME HDSP interface), occasionally longer.
