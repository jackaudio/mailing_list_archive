&gt;&gt; I've had limited ability to test this in detail.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Last year when I was playing with convolution reverb to augment a room's
&gt;&gt; acoustics, I found that JACK 2 would crash after 8 -9 hours of operation.
&gt;&gt; The computer would lock up hard and would not respond to anything but the
&gt;&gt; reset button.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Last night I thought I would check to see if it still did this, and was
&gt;&gt; astonished to find my computer still working after 14 hours and 15 minutes!
&gt;&gt; And within seconds of moving the mouse, the computer froze.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I realize super-long sessions are probably not common, but at some point in
&gt;&gt; the future I'm going to want to use Ardour to record uninterrupted multi-day
&gt;&gt; sessions, so I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to chase this down
&gt;&gt; and resolve it?
&gt; i have no specific data or suggestions, but i will say that my
&gt; hand-wavy gut-instinct is that this sort of thing tends to be often
&gt; associated with the ALSA device driver as much as with JACK. you've
&gt; got some (very painful) debugging ahead of you.
&gt;
&gt; for whatever its worth (not much) i run jack1 on my machine typically
&gt; for 4-7 days at a time (RME HDSP interface), occasionally longer.
Yeah, my next thought was to try jack 1. I'll set that test up now...
