Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] How does jackdmp set CPU affinity ?

Thanks a lot for the prompt reply Stéphane.

Please correct me if my understanding is incorrect.

Let me refer to Figure 1 in
http://www.grame.fr/Ressources/pub/Jackdmp-lac2005.pdf. Once client Input's
out ports are filled, it signals both  A and B by signalling their
JackSynchro objects. A and B  may run on different CPU's as the actual CPU
assignment is managed by the underlying Linux scheduler. After A and B
complete, both try to Signal client C, however client C only gets signalled
only once its activation counter gets decremented twice and reaches the
expected value.

I have not studied jack1, but was this scenario serialized in jack1 ? Would
jack1 have signal client A which would run and then signal client B which
would run and then signal client C ?

Regards,
Karthik Poduval
