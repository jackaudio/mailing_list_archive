Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack ringbuffer, what to do when bytes returned < expected?

Hi,

The documentation of jack_ringbuffer_read and jack_ringbuffer_write
suggest failures to write an entire 'item' to the buffer might occur.
Can I assume - in what I shall label as 'regular circumstances' - that
if a ring buffer is created which is a multiple of sizeof(item), that
the read/write on the buffer will never be partial, that is, it will
either fail completely, or succeed completely - the return value will
either be 0 or sizeof(item).

Can I assume that the return value of these functions would be >0 && <
expected only in 'irregular circumstances' where items of differing
sizeof()s are read/written (though who'd want the pain of that I'll
never (want to) know)?

If in 'regular circumstances' I can expect the return values to be > 0
&&  < expected, I take it another call should take care of it, without
having to resort to the more manual methods of accessing the
ringbuffer?

Cheers,
James.
