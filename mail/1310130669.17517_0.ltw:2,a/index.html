&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; The documentation of jack_ringbuffer_read and jack_ringbuffer_write
&gt; suggest failures to write an entire 'item' to the buffer might occur.
&gt; Can I assume - in what I shall label as 'regular circumstances' - that
&gt; if a ring buffer is created which is a multiple of sizeof(item), that
&gt; the read/write on the buffer will never be partial, that is, it will
&gt; either fail completely, or succeed completely - the return value will
&gt; either be 0 or sizeof(item).

the jack ringbuffers are sized in bytes, not items. if you were using
an "item-sized" buffer and only writing whole items, then you could
assume this, but the jack ringbuffers are not item-sized. Ardour has a
C++ ringbuffer (actually two of them) that work that way. for jack,
the "item" is 1 byte, and since you can't write less than a byte on
any relevant machine the same rules apply, but the result is not that
useful.

&gt; Can I assume that the return value of these functions would be &gt;0 &amp;&amp; &lt;
&gt; expected only in 'irregular circumstances' where items of differing
&gt; sizeof()s are read/written (though who'd want the pain of that I'll
&gt; never (want to) know)?

yes, but the return value could be 0 if the buffer is full.

&gt; If in 'regular circumstances' I can expect the return values to be &gt; 0
&gt; &amp;&amp; &#xA0;&lt; expected, I take it another call should take care of it, without
&gt; having to resort to the more manual methods of accessing the
&gt; ringbuffer?

no, because time plays a role. if it returns &lt; expected, there's no
way to know when you will be able to write the remaining data. you
need to either sleep, or do something else for a while, or block on
some kind of communication/sync primitive that will let you know when
space is available.
