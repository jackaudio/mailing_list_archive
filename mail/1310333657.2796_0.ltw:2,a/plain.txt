Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Audio Driver Hard IRQ Priority

Hi All,

I was reading about manually setting the priorities of Hard-IRQ threads in
the RT kernel from the following page.
http://subversion.ffado.org/wiki/IrqPriorities

Although the page explains about the firewire driver, my question is that
would doing such a setting for ALSA driver be recomended ?
Also what about the the differed functions/ bottom halves, is it used in the
alsa kernel driver?  In yes won't their priority also have to be raised if
we are raising the priority of the hardirq thread ?
