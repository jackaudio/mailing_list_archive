Subject:     [Jack-Devel] how often should one call jack_port_get_latency_range()

G'day!

I have a JACK client with a single audio-input-port (no output). This
input is used to parse Linear-Time-Code. For synchronization the
application needs to know the capture-latency of said audio-port.

So the question is: how often should the application call
jack_port_get_latency_range() ?

Currently it does so in every process_callback.

Is this the correct solution?

The overhead may be minimal, but still it feels somewhat wrong to poll
it during every process() cycle. Is there a callback that can be
subscribed to to get notified of changes to port-latencies?

TIA,
robin
