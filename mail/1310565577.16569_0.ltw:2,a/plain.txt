From the same documentation:

  | Clients that meet any of the following conditions do NOT need to
  | register a latency callback:
  |
  |  * have only input ports
  |  * ..

All of the criteria are matched in my app (xjadeo), but it's somewhat
misleading as these criteria are only concerned with the client
_setting_ the latency.

It would be helpful to mention that this callback can also be used to
query it.

On that note: In which order is this callback executed?
Can one query the jack_port_get_latency_range() from within this
callback? - It seems possible that some clients may not yet have updated
their latency when the callback is invoked in some other client.

Is this correct?

If so a client only interested in querying the latency should set a flag
in in the latency_callback function and [later] query the new port
latency during the process_callback IFF this flag is set, right?

ciao,
