Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jackd2+ardour3 - tracking down "JackActivationCount::Signal value = 0 ref = INT"

Hi there,

I'm occasionally experiencing
  JackActivationCount::Signal value = 0 ref = <INT>
errors with jackdmp 1.9.8

They seem more frequent when running in synchronous mode
 'jackd -S ..' or 'jackcfg engine sync boolean true'
and mostly with (but not limited to) ardour3.

I hazard a guess that it's related to high DSP load:
  I can almost always reproduce it by adding a couple of CPU intense
foo-yc20 organs as LV2 plugin in ardour3. It works OK for a while
but once the first of these messages appear it goes downward:
ardour3 adds to the [CPU] load by printing those frequent messages to
the log-window; which in turn produces more "JackActivationCount"
messages until the ardour becomes almost completely unresponsive.

Is the assumption right that "JackActivationCount" is related to
DSP-load/x-runs?  How could one track this down?

TIA,
robin
