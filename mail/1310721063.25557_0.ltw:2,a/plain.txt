Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK on windows: how do native window audio apps connect?

hi everyone!


life's a bitch, so i have to run JACK on windows... i've used it on 
macos to great effect, where i could create a coreaudio-like jack device 
which native clients like max/msp then connected to.

is there an equivalent mechanism for JACK on windows? i briefly 
installed a jackdmp package, but i couldn'd figure out if or how it 
would interoperate with native windows audio clients.

the purpose is to pipe audio from a proprietary 3d video player to a 
linux ambisonic rendering machine via netjack.


best,


jörn
