In-Reply-To: Jörn Nettingsmeier [Jack-Devel] JACK on windows: how do native window audio apps connect? (1310721063.25557_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK on windows: how do native window audio apps connect?

Hi Jörn,

I'm a Jack for Windows user, not a Dev.... but in Windows all ASIO
audio apps are catered for via the JackRouter driver (ASIO -> JACK
Audio Server). There are two native Jack apps out there. See the
http://www.jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows page for more info.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
