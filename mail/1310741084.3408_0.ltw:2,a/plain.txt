Ok, this makes much more sense!

They are still not "strict XRun": in asynchronous mode XRuns are detected by the server which just checks that all clients have be run previous cycle. It then print something like:

"JackEngine::XRun : client = XXX was not run: state = 2"

Don't you see there kind of messages along the "JackActivationCount...." ones?

OK this can be done quite easily...

Yes -S for "synchronous" is a server setting. It can actually be used with different kind of backend.
