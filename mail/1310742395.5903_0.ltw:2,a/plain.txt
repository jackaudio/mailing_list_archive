yes.

jackd verbose log:
 JackEngine::XRun: client = ardour was not run: state = 2
 JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
 JackEngine::XRun: client = ardour was not run: state = 2
 JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error

ardour log:
 [ERROR]: JACK: JackActivationCount::Signal value = 0 ref = 3
 [ERROR]: JACK: JackActivationCount::Signal value = 0 ref = 3

Good!

This is only really relevant when DSP load is ~ 85-95%.

Well, I do launch jackdbus and then call
    jack_control eps sync true
_before_ starting the engine. There's no "-S" parameter involved.
