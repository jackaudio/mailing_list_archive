Yes. (BTW. Could one disable those as well? Does jack have a "quiet"
mode that only logs fatal errors?)

Yes; usually those x-runs are just a transient condition.

AFAIK, logging of Xruns by jackdbus is done in the non-RT thread which
does not add to DSP load.

One could view this change as a workaround for apps that catch and print
"JackActivationCount" messages (I guess even from the RT thread). Known
susceptible apps are pure-data and ardour2/3 and there are possibly a
few more.

It makes me wonder: Why are the Xrun messages exclusively in jack.log
and the "JackActivationCount" messages exclusively in the application
log? Here the latter do not show up in jack.log.


Thanks,
robin
