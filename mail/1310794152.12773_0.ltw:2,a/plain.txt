Jack2 has 3 kinds of messages printed by : 

- jack_error (real important ones..)

- jack_info : informative purpose

- jack_log: for debugging purposes...


BTW, how does jack1 displays XRun ? (or any  fatal errors)

This is in jackdbus right? How the info/log/error message are handled can be configurated with the jack_set_error_function/jack_set_info_function from jack.h API. You should look in how jackdbus configure them. And/or ask Nedko...
