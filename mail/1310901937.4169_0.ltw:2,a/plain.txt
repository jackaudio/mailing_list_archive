ATM jackdbus has same control over what is logged as jackd. I'd be happy
if jackdbus is able to configure what is logged on-the-fly (without
restarting the server).

AFAIK messages that are logged in server don't end up in client log
callbacks. jackdbus sets log callabacks so the messages that originate
in server go to the jackdbus log file. messages that originate in client
(libjack) are still logged at client side, either through default
callback that prints to stdout/stderr or through a custom callback that
makes them appear in a GUI window for example (ardour).
