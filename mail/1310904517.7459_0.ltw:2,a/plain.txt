I guess you mean jackdbus not jackd. jackdbus is designed and
implemented as singleton. It could be extended to allow multiple servers
but I never got enough info about how this setup is supposed to be used
and I don't know how to design it properly.

When you set any parameter, engine(server) or driver one, it is recorded
in jackdbus memory and also saved in the ~/.config/jack/conf.xml
file. When you start server, parameters that are set in memory are
used. When jackdbus process is activated it reads settings from the
config file.

If you somehow manage to start second jackdbus instance, it will use the
same config and files. Hopefully it is evident why this is not a good
thing to do.
