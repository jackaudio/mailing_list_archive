Maybe, or have better logging in jack2. Inspecting several old lines on
each new log line is probably waste of CPU. Do you have a motivation to
implement such supersmart logger?

If this error log line sequence is generated in single thread, error
messages can be collected and then logged as a single line. Not sure how
viable such solution is in the C++ do-it-right (tm) land. C++ exceptions
are not universally accepted.

This indicates issue with jack2 itself. Either genuinely wrong logic
somewhere or it gets fooled by external events. IMO.
