HI,

is it still the case that:

"changing the SR is not implemented and we have no plans at present to
implement it. it was added to the API at the outset, and over time is
has become clear that it causes a lot of pain for many apps if we were
to implement it. neither jack2 nor jack1 actually does anything when a
client makes this request. however we have still not definitively
decided whether or not it should be a functioning part of the API,
hence the misleading situation you see at present."

James.
