I second Chris' enthusiasm on seeing updates on this project! Do you have a page
or blog where you are documenting your updates?

I don't really know how, yet, to be able to help, but I would like to at some
point! For my personal tastes, a specification of 16-32 channels in and 2-8 out
would be perfect as it could form the central point of a recording studio, and
also some portability (for example, taking the unit out of the studio and using
it with a laptop for recording a live concert) would make it a very attractive
piece of hardware!

I've seen commercial development of a couple of audio over ethernet systems,
such as Focusrite's RedNet series, but upon enquiry they don't seem to be
interested in venturing into Linux as well as Windows and OSX, but a system like
this that uses JACK on all platforms can only improve the desirability of this
hardware.

Looking forward to hear more,

Dan
