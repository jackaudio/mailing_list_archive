Subject:     [Jack-Devel] colons in port names

looking for a consensus on whether or not JACK should allow/disallow
colons in port names, and how stringently it should enforce a ban if
there is one.

at present, it is legal to use a colon in the port name (but not the
client name), which can allow the formation of a port name like

  client:foo: bar

JACK doesn't have any issues with this name - it always uses the
left-most colon as the separator between the client name and the port
name.

should we:

    1) do nothing
    2) note that its unwise to use colons in the documentation, but nothing more
    3) enforce a no-colon rule
