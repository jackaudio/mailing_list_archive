Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Windows / Linux in 32 bit

Hi,


A while ago, I wanted to send MIDI to Hauptwerk (Windows Vista x64) from a
small Linux machine. The resulting audio was also to be routed back from
Windows back to the Linux machine.

I could not make it work in 64 bit (1.9.8). but in the meantime I did
succeed in 32 bit (1.9.7) using Hauptwerk 32 bit. But now, at least, I know
how the system is supposed to work (JackRouter, ASIO, loopMIDI,
audioadapter).

I have three questions:


1. The main problem with getting 64 bits going is JackRouter. No matter what
I try, I can't get JackRouter.dll registered. I even tried building the
.dll, but for that, you also need the .libs and in CodeBlocks I got for
every target:

'libjackserver - Win32 Release 64bits" uses an invalid compiler. Probably
the toolchain path within the compiler options is not setup correctly?!
Skipping...'

If anyone can help me out so I can test 64 bits again, feel free. Mind you,
I have only Visual Studio Express 2010.


2. I was hinted earlier to use loopMIDI. It works great, but only if the
sending end of the MIDI loop is already opened by Hauptwerk *before* jackd
-X winmme is started. Otherwise jackd will gobble it up, making it
unaccessible for Hauptwerk. Unfortunately, running Hauptwerk without the
JackRouter running first always makes Hauptwerk forget its ASIO setup.

So currently I must first start HW without jackd, in order to lock the MIDI
port. Then I start 'jackd -R -S -X winmme -dnet -i1 -C0 -P2'. Then I leave
HW,  start 'jack_load audioadapter', restart HW and reselect the ASIO
config.

Very cumbersome. Would it be possible to instruct jackd not to eat all MIDI
ports available ?


3. The round-trip delay from key to sound is a bit long (100..200ms). Any
hints on how to improve this or diagnose it ?


Thanks,


J.
