(3), without reservation.


And while we are at it, I'd like to add the following recommendations:

1. Hierarchical port names should be composed the way Ardour does it,
   using '/' to separate components of the name.

2. Ports which are part of a multichannel group should have names of
   the form

   clientname:groupname.channel

so that one day (dreaming) tools like qjackctl could recognise such
groups, present them as one port (unless the user expands them), and
do the 'right thing' when connecting them which is to connect ports
with the same channel name. This format is already being used by my
Ambisonic tools for example (where a group could easily be 16 or 25
channels - a pain to connect manually). It makes sense even for
stereo: "master/out.L", "master/out.R".

Ciao,
