I am generally for restricting identifiers (and this is an identifier,
not a "friendly name") wherever there's any reason at all to do so.  In
this case, I could go either way.  Precisely what characters are
allowed, and how to parse the full name, definitely needs to be defined
though.

Things you can't map to a good old fashioned file path (or scripting
language identifier) are annoying and anti-UNIX and all that, but we're
using slashes in practise, so that's already out the window I suppose.

Grouping should be done with a more expressive/explicit/etc mechanism
than doing things based on the name; namely simple key/value metadata
for ports (which nicely solves several other things we've longed for).
Ditto "friendly names".  To do this correctly you need something a bit
better, since short of very strictly enforcing names for channels (L? l?
left? left_out? out_left?) you can't tell which port is which channel
anyway.  As I like to say, Jack doesn't really even support stereo at
present :)

That said, a naming convention for groups would be good, anyway.  This
one looks nice.  Sold.
