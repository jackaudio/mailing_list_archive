Hi Jeroen,

If you are having problems registering the 64-bit jackRouter dll then
you may have registered it in the past and need to unregister it
first...

This is the command that I use for registering the dll

regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll"

regsvr32 /u "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll"
would then be used to unregister the dll....

jackd -X winmme is rather new to me, so I have no idea what to advise
for you in regard to LoopMIDI and Hautpwerk JackRouter. Perhaps
Stephane can comment? Same goes for the round-trip delay... as I have
not done this myself I can't give you tips.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
