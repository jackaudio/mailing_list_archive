I did all that (although it seems you can unregister a dll as many times as
you like...) I also made sure my regsvr32.exe originates from
c:\windows\system32.

That one I got fixed. It is *imperative* to run the whole thing in realtime
/ with locked down memory. (You can improve already some using smaller
periods, but it quickly leads to overruns.) My server command now reads:

   pasuspender -- jackd -R -dalsa -p256 -r44100 -Xseq

and reports no errors or warnings now.

Thanks very much for your input.


Jeroen.
