You're sure this works? Last time I rebased a published branch and
pushed the results, it made commits show up multiple times with new
SHAs. Which more or less makes sense, since rebase changes commits.

Here:

   http://repo.or.cz/w/ffado.git/shortlog/refs/heads/debug-cleanup

Four times "LIBRAW1394". Given that a rebase changes the starting point
in history, everyone who has the mob branch would need to change it,
too.

I read a bit on the Internet the other day:

   https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Why_won.27t_.22git_push.22_work_after_I_rebase_a_branch.3F


But maybe I miss something?


Cheers
