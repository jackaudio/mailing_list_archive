&gt;  It looks to me that NetJack only relies on UDP. That will keep memory
&gt; requirements in your IP stack down. But for 128 channels you need to
&gt; transmit at least 4*128*48000 = 25MB/sec (Jack uses floats - just consider
&gt; that part of the 'learning exercise' ;-) ) That's a massive amount of data
&gt; for a network stack, let alone an embedded one running on a softcore. And
&gt; you need GbE.
&gt;
&gt; The hard part is going to be the synchronisation. However, you're in the
&gt; unique position to be able to vary your clock...
&gt;
&gt; Therefore: why not run your system as a *slave*, doing only 8 channels or
&gt; so ?
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering if you would be able to send/receive only broadcast MAC
&gt; traffic (to/from FF:...:FF) to initiate the UDP communications with the
&gt; master and then strip the orig. MAC address from the server's response to
&gt; set up the final link without ARP. You may be able to drop the software IP
&gt; stack entirely in that case, allowing you to keep your program really small.
&gt;
&gt; I think you could get that going on a cheap 144-pin Cyclone III EP3C5 or
&gt; EP3C10 without any external memories, interfacing to e.g. a CS5368 and a
&gt; Fast Ethernet PHY. And a MIDI port.
&gt;
&gt; The hard part (making connections, doing qjackctl) remains on the server.
&gt;
&gt; Need more channels ? Connect more slaves to a (gigabit) Ethernet switch.
&gt; You cannot do that with Jack servers.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, lets you keep away from Gigabit on your board as well.
&gt;
&gt; Just my initial thoughts. Feel free to comment.

Thanks for your response and your expertise Jeroen!

I agree in that 128 channels for one unit is going to be quite a challenge,
technically, and for someone like me who intends on having a modest project
studio, I doubt that I would ever need more than 16 channels (32 at the
extreme) to be sent in. For most orchestra configurations, even if you had
one microphone per performer, 40 would be certainly feasible!

I did also wonder about Leeloo's approach in terms of having the hardware
device being the master, rather than the computer. In one way I can
understand it in that the hardware clock may be more reliable, but with a
Linux machine that has a programmable kernel timer, so the flexibility there
would definitely supersede that.

So, in your slave scenario, would you have the device instantly begin to
send UDP data once it starts? Removing the MAC traffic certainly sounds like
an efficient way of doing it - to have a running status. Although, would
that create problems if you had more that one of these devices running into
the same master computer?

I will research the components that you have listed as well. For the use of
the MIDI port, would that be intended to send MIDI data from a keyboard or
controller, or do you mean more for synchronisation purposes? Do you
recommend any development boards that may be suitable for this project?

Already, for me this is starting to feel more feasible, given the educated
real-world response. Please feel free to comment as well, as I am sure there
are many things I'll need to learn before I start to get somewhere with this
project!

I look forward to hearing more!

Kind Regards,

Dan
