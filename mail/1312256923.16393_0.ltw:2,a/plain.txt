Thanks for your response and your expertise Jeroen!

I agree in that 128 channels for one unit is going to be quite a challenge,
technically, and for someone like me who intends on having a modest project
studio, I doubt that I would ever need more than 16 channels (32 at the
extreme) to be sent in. For most orchestra configurations, even if you had
one microphone per performer, 40 would be certainly feasible!

I did also wonder about Leeloo's approach in terms of having the hardware
device being the master, rather than the computer. In one way I can
understand it in that the hardware clock may be more reliable, but with a
Linux machine that has a programmable kernel timer, so the flexibility there
would definitely supersede that.

So, in your slave scenario, would you have the device instantly begin to
send UDP data once it starts? Removing the MAC traffic certainly sounds like
an efficient way of doing it - to have a running status. Although, would
that create problems if you had more that one of these devices running into
the same master computer?

I will research the components that you have listed as well. For the use of
the MIDI port, would that be intended to send MIDI data from a keyboard or
controller, or do you mean more for synchronisation purposes? Do you
recommend any development boards that may be suitable for this project?

Already, for me this is starting to feel more feasible, given the educated
real-world response. Please feel free to comment as well, as I am sure there
are many things I'll need to learn before I start to get somewhere with this
project!

I look forward to hearing more!

Kind Regards,

Dan
