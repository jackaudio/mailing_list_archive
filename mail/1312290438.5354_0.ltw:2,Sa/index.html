&gt;&gt;  It looks to me that NetJack only relies on UDP. That will keep memory
&gt;&gt; requirements in your IP stack down. But for 128 channels you need to
&gt;&gt; transmit at least 4*128*48000 = 25MB/sec (Jack uses floats - just consider

Given that you're most likely writing your own RX/TX code, you can
forget about floats and stick to your ADC/DACs data format, which
probably means 24bit integer, maybe 16.

You then do float&lt;-&gt;int conversion in your RX/TX software module. OTOH,
any modern FPGA shouldn't be too stressed by floats, so you could
offload this work to your hardware.

&gt;&gt; The hard part is going to be the synchronisation. However, you're in the
&gt;&gt; unique position to be able to vary your clock...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Therefore: why not run your system as a *slave*

I second this. Especially since the ADC should always be the driving
clock. I assume the DAC shares the clock signal on the PCB.

Of course, adding multiple of those boards to the same network without
synchronization on the audio side could be cumbersome and sooner or
later would lead to AVC, but let's keep things simple and assume a
single unit or external (digital) syncing for now. (unless you're aiming
for the one-fits-all solution)

&gt; I did also wonder about Leeloo's approach in terms of having the hardware
&gt; device being the master, rather than the computer.

Go for it, it saves you a lot of trouble.

&gt; In one way I can understand it in that the hardware clock may be more
&gt; reliable, but with a Linux machine that has a programmable kernel
&gt; timer, so the flexibility there would definitely supersede that.

See, time is just an idea, it only exists in the real world, the whole
digital side has no notion of time whatsoever. It only counts state
changes. And your only relation to the real world is at the ADC/DAC
ports.

That said, you clock inside the audio box, send it to the PC, let it
process it and feed the result back to the audio box. No woe about
resampling.

&gt; So, in your slave scenario, would you have the device instantly begin to
&gt; send UDP data once it starts?

This should do the trick, yes. And if you add timestamps (in a sense of
presentation time, IOW, when the audio signal hit (left) the ADC or will
hit the DAC), you can reuse this timestamp in your RX/TX backend, add
your jackd buffer size and send it back to the audio box for the
outgoing stream. (mind the hw-rx buffers in your device)
