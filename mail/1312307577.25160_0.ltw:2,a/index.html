I've had a similar idea for a while, but slightly different: I have 
wanted to use a newer ARM chip (like what's in a modern smart phone) as 
the central design piece of the box.

It could run Linux (and therefore netjack) directly, so it wouldn't 
require a bunch of FPGA design.

If there's enough CPU left over, or a second core, perhaps it could even 
do some processing via LV2 or LADSPA within the box... maybe it has 8 
inputs and 8 outputs, and it acts as a network-programmed effects box 
with network sends for recording.

If the design is flexible enough, maybe there's an 8-channel power 
amplifier that gets its signal over the network, and it handles its own 
digital crossover, with EQ, delay, whatever there's CPU power for.

A number of people who are knowledgeable in this field have pooh-poohed 
this idea, so I've put it out of my mind for the most part . . . But if 
there were, say, a 4-in, 4-out model for $299, or 8x8 for $499, or 16x16 
for $799, and a 4-channel high-power amplifier that could run off either 
a 12-volt car system or a standard 120 or 240 AC setup, I'd buy lots and 
lots of them.

So why don't we design this thing using free and open-source tools, 
publish the design under an open hardware license, and sell finished, 
polished products, which people could also build on their own if they 
really wanted to?

&gt;&gt;&gt;   It looks to me that NetJack only relies on UDP. That will keep memory
&gt;&gt;&gt; requirements in your IP stack down. But for 128 channels you need to
&gt;&gt;&gt; transmit at least 4*128*48000 = 25MB/sec (Jack uses floats - just consider
&gt; Given that you're most likely writing your own RX/TX code, you can
&gt; forget about floats and stick to your ADC/DACs data format, which
&gt; probably means 24bit integer, maybe 16.
&gt;
&gt; You then do float&lt;-&gt;int conversion in your RX/TX software module. OTOH,
&gt; any modern FPGA shouldn't be too stressed by floats, so you could
&gt; offload this work to your hardware.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The hard part is going to be the synchronisation. However, you're in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; unique position to be able to vary your clock...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore: why not run your system as a *slave*
&gt; I second this. Especially since the ADC should always be the driving
&gt; clock. I assume the DAC shares the clock signal on the PCB.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, adding multiple of those boards to the same network without
&gt; synchronization on the audio side could be cumbersome and sooner or
&gt; later would lead to AVC, but let's keep things simple and assume a
&gt; single unit or external (digital) syncing for now. (unless you're aiming
&gt; for the one-fits-all solution)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I did also wonder about Leeloo's approach in terms of having the hardware
&gt;&gt; device being the master, rather than the computer.
&gt; Go for it, it saves you a lot of trouble.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; In one way I can understand it in that the hardware clock may be more
&gt;&gt; reliable, but with a Linux machine that has a programmable kernel
&gt;&gt; timer, so the flexibility there would definitely supersede that.
&gt; See, time is just an idea, it only exists in the real world, the whole
&gt; digital side has no notion of time whatsoever. It only counts state
&gt; changes. And your only relation to the real world is at the ADC/DAC
&gt; ports.
&gt;
&gt; That said, you clock inside the audio box, send it to the PC, let it
&gt; process it and feed the result back to the audio box. No woe about
&gt; resampling.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, in your slave scenario, would you have the device instantly begin to
&gt;&gt; send UDP data once it starts?
&gt; This should do the trick, yes. And if you add timestamps (in a sense of
&gt; presentation time, IOW, when the audio signal hit (left) the ADC or will
&gt; hit the DAC), you can reuse this timestamp in your RX/TX backend, add
&gt; your jackd buffer size and send it back to the audio box for the
&gt; outgoing stream. (mind the hw-rx buffers in your device)
&gt;
&gt;
