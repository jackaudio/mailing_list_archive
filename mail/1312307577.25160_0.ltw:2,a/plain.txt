Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Ethernet-based audio interface using (net)jack idea

I've had a similar idea for a while, but slightly different: I have 
wanted to use a newer ARM chip (like what's in a modern smart phone) as 
the central design piece of the box.

It could run Linux (and therefore netjack) directly, so it wouldn't 
require a bunch of FPGA design.

If there's enough CPU left over, or a second core, perhaps it could even 
do some processing via LV2 or LADSPA within the box... maybe it has 8 
inputs and 8 outputs, and it acts as a network-programmed effects box 
with network sends for recording.

If the design is flexible enough, maybe there's an 8-channel power 
amplifier that gets its signal over the network, and it handles its own 
digital crossover, with EQ, delay, whatever there's CPU power for.

A number of people who are knowledgeable in this field have pooh-poohed 
this idea, so I've put it out of my mind for the most part . . . But if 
there were, say, a 4-in, 4-out model for $299, or 8x8 for $499, or 16x16 
for $799, and a 4-channel high-power amplifier that could run off either 
a 12-volt car system or a standard 120 or 240 AC setup, I'd buy lots and 
lots of them.

So why don't we design this thing using free and open-source tools, 
publish the design under an open hardware license, and sell finished, 
polished products, which people could also build on their own if they 
really wanted to?
