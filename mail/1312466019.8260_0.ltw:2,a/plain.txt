OK... after further thought, I retract my proposal.

When using the read/write vectors... the programmer must never EVER:

  - Assume that the read/write vector jack_ringbuffer_data_t::buf
    is aligned.

  - Directly cast jack_ringbuffer_data_t::buf to anything with
    a size > 1 byte.

I.e. the read/write vectors are only suitable for memcopying the data
to a properly aligned float* buffer.  Therefore, I'll instead submit a
documentation patch... to warn about this.

p.s. I made this programming error while playing around with
read/write vectors in trying to create a test case for memory ordering
issues.  (No flames or continued discussions, I was just having some
fun.)
