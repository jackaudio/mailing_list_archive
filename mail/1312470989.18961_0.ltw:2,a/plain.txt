Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Lost JACK and Linux Newbie

All,

Please forgive the breach of ettiquette in using this forum for purposes other than development, but I would like to ask if someone would be willing to provide some help via email or even remote desktop for getting JACK and software synthesis (MIDI) working on an OpenSUSE machine.  (I'd like to get Rosegarden woring with MIDI while Ardour's MIDI capabilities are under development.)

I have an IT background in Windows but am learning my way around Linux.  I have to think that overcoming the difficulty of getting music software to do in Linux what Windows Media Player does with no user configuration at all would go a long way to increasing donations to keep Paul on the job.  If someone would be kind enough to walk me through, perhaps my development contribution (as an act of contrition for using the development mailing list!) could be to write some more documentation.

Thanks!

Steven
