Hi Stefan,

Please note that JACK is primarily designed for "pro" work, ie: recording
studios, live performances, and other demanding audio tasks. To get "Linux
Media Player", there is a *huge* range of programs, (banshee, rhythmbox,
Exaile to name 3 big ones). Save yourself some effort, and use those for
audio, you do not *need* jack for this. It can be done, but its not the easy
way to start.

Feel free to email me if a quick google doesn't answer your question ( & off
list please!) -Harry
