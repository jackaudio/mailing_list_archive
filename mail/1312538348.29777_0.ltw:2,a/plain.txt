Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack_get_ports, jack_connect, etc. & client reference

Hi,

I'm working on fixing a known issue with the Java bindings I emailed
about earlier this week, and wondered if I could get some advice about
something in the Jack API.

Currently, my equivalents of jack_get_ports, jack_connect,
jack_disconnect, etc. don't require a client to be passed in.
Instead, I'm using a cached and inactive client within the wrapper to
pass in, however this is failing because of some invalid caching if
the Jack server is restarted during the lifetime of the application.
I know how to fix this caching problem, but I'm wondering whether this
is the best approach - others would seem to be to register a temporary
client on every call, or to change the API and force the user to pass
in a client reference as Jack itself does.  Any advice?  I can't say
I'm entirely sure why these function (and some others) require a
client passed in, and can't seem to find anything in the documentation
to explain why this client is required - apologies if I've missed
something obvious.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best wishes,  Neil
