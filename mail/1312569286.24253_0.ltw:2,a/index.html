&gt; I think there are a few more companies looking at this kind of 
&gt; technology now, and as mentioned in my initial post, Focusrite are 
&gt; using such technology based on reference designs from Audinate: 
&gt; http://www.focusrite.com/rednet/
Rednet looks pretty cool. But they only mention it working with 
CoreAudio or ASIO, so it's obviously not good enough for us ;-)
&gt; Of course, their approach is quite extensive in terms of remote 
&gt; control of devices beyond adjustment of gain, but I agree with the 
&gt; notion that this (our idea here) could become an open-source project. 
&gt; ARM is certainly an option, and a couple of years ago I was made aware 
&gt; of the Beagle Board systems, which are pretty flexible.
Beagleboards are great. I lean towards a solution based on ARM because 
there could be a full JACK server on each client--so everything from 
basic routing to DSP could be done inside that box and potentially not 
have to go over the network at all.

Aside: Remote gain control is a hard problem to solve. I think it would 
actually make the most sense to have 3 or 4 preamps on each signal, 
permanently set to specific gain levels, and then digitally recombine 
them into signal that exposes the whole gain range. I haven't written 
anything up on that, yet, because I don't have any mic duplicators here...

&gt; I'm not sure if that's my intent though - it might be better to take 
&gt; the approach of something that is quite robust, with a minimal amount 
&gt; of software.

If all you need is more distance for a digital signal, you can get some 
line driver chips from National that will take the TTL level signal from 
a TOSLINK connector and drive it over CAT5 or equivalent for 100 meters 
or more. (I've actually wanted to do that for a while, but it doesn't 
solve remote gain at all.)

&gt; On the network side, using a switch to route the network traffic to 
&gt; the computer sounds like a very good method of combining multiple 
&gt; units. The company I work for at the moment make use of TrendNet 
&gt; switches, and from their 8-port PoE units to their 48-port 1Gbps in 
&gt; both directions units, they seem to make some very reliable hardware, 
&gt; and certainly these and other reliable brands could be used as the 
&gt; 'backbone' of a good audio network.

There are some 802.1 and 802.3 specs that just came out last year for 
audio over routable ethernet. They're not really relevant to this 
conversation, but I bring it up because the hardware they specifically 
mention is a modified Netgear 24-port gigabit switch--the same one you 
can get on-line for $200 or so--and all it has is better firmware so it 
knows how to implement that protocol.

Make sure the switch has enough backbone. Some larger gigabit switches 
only have a 2-gigabit backbone, which will not suffice.

&gt; I've found a couple of ADC and DAC circuits through my searches on the 
&gt; internet, so replicating those would certainly make this an 
&gt; open-source project! However, the analogue side of this scenario is 
&gt; always the easy side, at least for me. In order for a system like this 
&gt; to work, and based from what I've read about the JACK system so far, 
&gt; would I need to 'spoof' some kind of audio interface that JACK would 
&gt; connect to?

Depending on the ARM chip you went with, you could use an off-the-shelf, 
consumer-grade ADC and DAC for a 2-in, 2-out unit; maybe more, even 
2-in, 8-out or something like that.

To get more than that, you will almost certainly have to add an FPGA to 
the board (just a little cheap one will suffice) and have someone who 
knows about those things program the FPGA to translate ADC signals to 
something the ARM chip can understand, like PCIe, and then translate the 
PCIe back into signals for the DACs to send out. Paul Davis might know 
something about that, having written the first Linux driver for the RME 
Hammerfall series of cards, which use an FPGA setup to make ADAT signals 
available to the CPU. Faberman (whose real name escapes me ATM) might 
also know.

&gt; Another 'guess' of mine is that if we're going to approach this 
&gt; hardware as a slave device to the main computer, are we going to need 
&gt; some kind of bi-directional connection when it comes to the 
&gt; synchronisation? Or, is it feasible for the whole system, given that 
&gt; low latency is a requirement (or at least a desirable element) that we 
&gt; could have the machine send out the 'master clock' signals, and assume 
&gt; that they reach the end unit as intended?

Oh yeah, that's the other thing you'll use the FPGA for: to generate a 
wordclock signal to match what's coming through the network.

The new 802.1 standards do define how to keep a single wordclock present 
across an entire network, but that all requires new and specialized 
(read: stupidly expensive) NICs and switches, so I'm not sold on that.

&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Dan

Let's please make this happen. If someone made the product we were 
talking about here, I would buy a bunch of them right off the bat!
