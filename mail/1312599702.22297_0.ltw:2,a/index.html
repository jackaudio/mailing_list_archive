&gt;&gt; Of course, their approach is quite extensive in terms of remote control of
&gt;&gt; devices beyond adjustment of gain, but I agree with the notion that this
&gt;&gt; (our idea here) could become an open-source project. ARM is certainly an
&gt;&gt; option, and a couple of years ago I was made aware of the Beagle Board
&gt;&gt; systems, which are pretty flexible.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Beagleboards are great. I lean towards a solution based on ARM because
&gt; there could be a full JACK server on each client--so everything from basic
&gt; routing to DSP could be done inside that box and potentially not have to go
&gt; over the network at all.
&gt;
&gt; That sounds like a good idea! The amount of data that can be sent over the
network is always going to be limited, so more is less is more in this case
- which is a good thing! :-)


&gt; Aside: Remote gain control is a hard problem to solve. I think it would
&gt; actually make the most sense to have 3 or 4 preamps on each signal,
&gt; permanently set to specific gain levels, and then digitally recombine them
&gt; into signal that exposes the whole gain range. I haven't written anything up
&gt; on that, yet, because I don't have any mic duplicators here...
&gt;
&gt; That's true - I think the angle that I'm coming from is to have an audio
interface that is configured in such a way that the audio signals don't
clip, but then the 'gain' of each signal is then controlled in the host
application, such as Ardour. Seeing as the work is ending up there, and I
may use a system like this in a portable fashion, not having a mixing desk
would be definitely beneficial, and the analogue signal path then remains
much shorter and more direct.

&gt;
&gt; If all you need is more distance for a digital signal, you can get some
&gt; line driver chips from National that will take the TTL level signal from a
&gt; TOSLINK connector and drive it over CAT5 or equivalent for 100 meters or
&gt; more. (I've actually wanted to do that for a while, but it doesn't solve
&gt; remote gain at all.)
&gt;
&gt; Distance wasn't really the fundamental core of my thoughts on this project,
more the saving of cables, and using non-proprietary hardware so that it's
not limited to the people who 'throw money at it' :-) having a system
transport data over a long distance would certainly be an option, as that
wouldn't be limited to our hardware; we can use switches and repeaters
already available on the market for that task.

&gt;
&gt; There are some 802.1 and 802.3 specs that just came out last year for audio
&gt; over routable ethernet. They're not really relevant to this conversation,
&gt; but I bring it up because the hardware they specifically mention is a
&gt; modified Netgear 24-port gigabit switch--the same one you can get on-line
&gt; for $200 or so--and all it has is better firmware so it knows how to
&gt; implement that protocol.
&gt;
&gt; Make sure the switch has enough backbone. Some larger gigabit switches only
&gt; have a 2-gigabit backbone, which will not suffice.
&gt;
&gt; Interesting - I'll have to read up on those specifications as I wasn't
aware of that. I agree though, seeing as JACK sends its data via UDP
packets, the performance of any switch or router will mostly depend on their
ability to translate that traffic. It might be a bit of an overkill to have
a large switch for an audio network (unless there were many one or
two-channel devices, such as 'stage box' style interfaces), but again that's
certainly something that's worth considering!

&gt;
&gt;  I've found a couple of ADC and DAC circuits through my searches on the
&gt;&gt; internet, so replicating those would certainly make this an open-source
&gt;&gt; project! However, the analogue side of this scenario is always the easy
&gt;&gt; side, at least for me. In order for a system like this to work, and based
&gt;&gt; from what I've read about the JACK system so far, would I need to 'spoof'
&gt;&gt; some kind of audio interface that JACK would connect to?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Depending on the ARM chip you went with, you could use an off-the-shelf,
&gt; consumer-grade ADC and DAC for a 2-in, 2-out unit; maybe more, even 2-in,
&gt; 8-out or something like that.
&gt;
&gt; To get more than that, you will almost certainly have to add an FPGA to the
&gt; board (just a little cheap one will suffice) and have someone who knows
&gt; about those things program the FPGA to translate ADC signals to something
&gt; the ARM chip can understand, like PCIe, and then translate the PCIe back
&gt; into signals for the DACs to send out. Paul Davis might know something about
&gt; that, having written the first Linux driver for the RME Hammerfall series of
&gt; cards, which use an FPGA setup to make ADAT signals available to the CPU.
&gt; Faberman (whose real name escapes me ATM) might also know.
&gt;
&gt; I certainly would like to see if Paul chimes in on this thread - especially
if something could be produced that he approves of for Ardour. Like with
RME's use of Xilinx FPGAs, we could certainly have a central 'core' system
that interfaces any digital audio signals with JACK, and sends it off to the
'master' machine via Ethernet. That would allow for a large number of
combinations with the same core system, modifying the code slightly to
reference the correct number of inputs and outputs for that specific device
(say 2x2, or 16x16 devices as you mentioned in an earlier post, and also
formats such as ADAT, TDIF, AES3 that would work as a simple unit to capture
outputs from an existing mixer, recorder, et cetera).

&gt;
&gt;  Another 'guess' of mine is that if we're going to approach this hardware
&gt;&gt; as a slave device to the main computer, are we going to need some kind of
&gt;&gt; bi-directional connection when it comes to the synchronisation? Or, is it
&gt;&gt; feasible for the whole system, given that low latency is a requirement (or
&gt;&gt; at least a desirable element) that we could have the machine send out the
&gt;&gt; 'master clock' signals, and assume that they reach the end unit as intended?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, that's the other thing you'll use the FPGA for: to generate a
&gt; wordclock signal to match what's coming through the network.
&gt;
&gt; I'll also read up on the Word clock specifications - an area that I'm
entirely unaware of, aside from recognising its usefulness! I used to have a
RME Hammerfall (pre-HDSP) 9652 and two Behringer ADA8000 preamps, and
setting one as master, one as slave, and then having the RME sync to the
master was really simple. I think they included a schematic of the whole
system, so I'll search on the internet to see if the manual shows anything
useful in their implementation - you literally had two slider switches to
set the sample rate and the master/slave options...it can't really get any
simpler than that!


&gt; The new 802.1 standards do define how to keep a single wordclock present
&gt; across an entire network, but that all requires new and specialized (read:
&gt; stupidly expensive) NICs and switches, so I'm not sold on that.
&gt;
&gt; Agreed, stupidly expensive is just that - I feel the need for a reprieve
from all of these costly items!

Let's please make this happen. If someone made the product we were talking
&gt; about here, I would buy a bunch of them right off the bat!
&gt;
&gt; Me too! I'd love the chance to build my own studio, eventually, and on a
more personal note, I feel the need to take a step up in my Music Technology
knowledge while my music career is still getting off the ground. My wife and
I are expecting our first child in December, so I definitely have the
incentive to want to work on this if it makes their lives better too in the
process :-)
