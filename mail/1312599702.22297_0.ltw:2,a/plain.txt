application, such as Ardour. Seeing as the work is ending up there, and I
may use a system like this in a portable fashion, not having a mixing desk
would be definitely beneficial, and the analogue signal path then remains
much shorter and more direct.

transport data over a long distance would certainly be an option, as that
wouldn't be limited to our hardware; we can use switches and repeaters
already available on the market for that task.

aware of that. I agree though, seeing as JACK sends its data via UDP
packets, the performance of any switch or router will mostly depend on their
ability to translate that traffic. It might be a bit of an overkill to have
a large switch for an audio network (unless there were many one or
two-channel devices, such as 'stage box' style interfaces), but again that's
certainly something that's worth considering!

if something could be produced that he approves of for Ardour. Like with
RME's use of Xilinx FPGAs, we could certainly have a central 'core' system
that interfaces any digital audio signals with JACK, and sends it off to the
'master' machine via Ethernet. That would allow for a large number of
combinations with the same core system, modifying the code slightly to
reference the correct number of inputs and outputs for that specific device
(say 2x2, or 16x16 devices as you mentioned in an earlier post, and also
formats such as ADAT, TDIF, AES3 that would work as a simple unit to capture
outputs from an existing mixer, recorder, et cetera).

entirely unaware of, aside from recognising its usefulness! I used to have a
RME Hammerfall (pre-HDSP) 9652 and two Behringer ADA8000 preamps, and
setting one as master, one as slave, and then having the RME sync to the
master was really simple. I think they included a schematic of the whole
system, so I'll search on the internet to see if the manual shows anything
useful in their implementation - you literally had two slider switches to
set the sample rate and the master/slave options...it can't really get any
simpler than that!
