These are most of the reasons why I'm reluctant to take that route - and
also an Embedded system has that word of 'emulation' associated with it. The
specifications that you've given in your first paragraph here seem to
coincide with the idea that I've started with. We could certainly look into
using an embedded board, but I think for me, a hardened FPGA solution would
make the most sense in the real world. Out of my (realitively few)
experiences of software and hardware working together in the music world,
software has always been the bottleneck, or the point of most failure.

I think I need to draw out your proposal as a flow chart, Jeroen, to see it
graphically, but it sounds like a very robust and performant angle to take.
Again from my post yesterday, we could use this as the core system for a
number of end-user interface configurations, changing the program on the
FPGA to suit each specific situation. I think if we aimed for the most
demanding configuration, then 'working down' from there.

I was watching a couple of FPGA tutorial videos on YouTube last night, and
after while it all started to make sense. I'm fairly good with logic, and
apparently I know more about programming than I thought!

When I was looking for ADC circuits and preamps, I tried to stick towards
the direction of 'prosumer' or 'professional' solutions, when it came to
specifications. For example, I'm not sure that using a C-Media chip on the
board as an ALSA device would be the ideal situation (even though routing 8
channels of audio through a processor like that wouldn't be difficult), so
I'll have a look around at what (ALSA compatible) hardware is available.
Then again, if I'm to use good ADCs with a good signal to noise ratio, or
(optical) isolation, then the CMI chip is just there to route the signals to
the FPGA as an audio interface to the JACK server.

Jeroen, are the components you listed in your first response still
applicable for this method?
