I've just been researching the parts that you've listed, and I'll make sure
to download and read the data sheet for the EP3C10.

As for the Ethernet, I've found two controllers that may be worth looking at
- either the Microchip ENC424J600 (10/100 Base-T), or the Marvell Yukon
Ultra II (8E8057, which is 1000 Base-T). The microchip design sounds quite
promising, as I came across its 10Base-T 'cousin' when looking at the Open
Open Sound Controller project.

I may be thinking about this incorrectly, but my approach to have the ADC
talk to JACK on the FPGA was to have some kind of ALSA 'driver' for that
chip running in the FPGA, passing the data through JACK to the Ethernet
controller. Alas, the CS5368 chip isn't supported in ALSA, but we could use
the CMI8788 chip, which is almost exactly the same.

Then again, am I thinking about this incorrectly? If we could pass the
signals directly to the JACK system (literally give the data it wants), that
would circumvent another software layer in the FPGA...
