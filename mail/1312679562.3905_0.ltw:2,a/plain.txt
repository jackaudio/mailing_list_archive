I apologise, I misread the datasheet for the CS5368, so I change my
viewpoint on that IC, as it would be perfect for this project (which is why
you recommended it!). Actually, one of the circuits I came across for the
ADC section of the device uses that chip:
http://www.beis.de/Elektronik/ADDA24QS/ADDA24QS.html <-- The designer is
aiming for quality rather than cost savings, so again I'm sorry for the
false analysis!

I was also looking more at Altera's tutorial videos on YouTube, and if the
Cyclone III chip has enough space left, maybe we could create a device on
the chip itself, so that the digital audio signals can be sent to the JACK
server on the chip correctly. From what I've seen of this chip's
capabilities, I'm not sure that we'd be stressing it too much (for a
relative example, one of the video capture cards we use at my workplace has
the first Cyclone chip, which can handle 16 channels of 704x480, 16-bit
video at 7fps per channel)!
