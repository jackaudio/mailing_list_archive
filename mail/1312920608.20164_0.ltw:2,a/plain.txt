Interesting. I'm wondering if this would explain why I've never been able
to use my RME HDSPe MADI card in floating point mode with jack clients
on my x86_64 system. I haven't had time to investigate and have just been
using it in integer mode to get it working. 

I don't actually know what the byte order of the RME card's float output is,
but if jack has been getting it wrong that might explain why I was getting
very high level noise instead of a legitimate input signal.
