Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Ethernet-based audio interface using (net)jack idea

Apologies for not getting back to this thread for a week. While I've been
'away', I've been thinking about how to tackle having the digital audio from
the AD Jeroen mentioned make its way into JACK. Looking at the diagram (
http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack2) it looks like a
backend would have to be created that talks to both the FPGA and the CS5368.

For now, I'd like to think that the PCM data coming from the AD can be
directly connected to JACK's audio 'inputs'...channel 1 going to audio input
1, 2 to 2 and so on, and then JACK broadcasts that data to the network. In
that case, all we'd need to do on the FPGA is route the right audio channels
to the relevant JACK inputs running on that chip.

Would that be a fair assumption?

This project may be a bit slow to get started, but I do intend on keeping it
going!

As always, thanks for all of your help!

Dan
