&gt;&gt; Interesting. I'm wondering if this would explain why I've never been able
&gt;&gt; to use my RME HDSPe MADI card in floating point mode with jack clients
&gt;&gt; on my x86_64 system. I haven't had time to investigate and have just been
&gt;&gt; using it in integer mode to get it working.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't actually know what the byte order of the RME card's float output is,
&gt;&gt; but if jack has been getting it wrong that might explain why I was getting
&gt;&gt; very high level noise instead of a legitimate input signal.
&gt;
&gt; If the RME card is using a big-endian floats, then this is very likely  
&gt; the cause.

To follow this up, I contacted RME and they say all their current cards
use little-endian format. I still suspect incorrect byte order is a
possible culprit as the symptoms are what I'd expect if that was happening
(high level noise, many orders of magnitude higher than full scale on the
A-D converter).

BTW playback in floating point mode is fine, it's only capture that's
messed up.
