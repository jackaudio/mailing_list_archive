To follow this up, I contacted RME and they say all their current cards
use little-endian format. I still suspect incorrect byte order is a
possible culprit as the symptoms are what I'd expect if that was happening
(high level noise, many orders of magnitude higher than full scale on the
A-D converter).

BTW playback in floating point mode is fine, it's only capture that's
messed up.
