I seriously doubt if you can get a sampling clock with the required
low jitter using the FPGA's digital PLLs. The next thing to look at
would be an external VCXO module to generate the master clock, with
the loop closed by digital filtering in the FPGA followed by an
analog lowpass driving the VCXO. Lock range for VCXOs is small but
it should be enough to cover typical sound card frequency
