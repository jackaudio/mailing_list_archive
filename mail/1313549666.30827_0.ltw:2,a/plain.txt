My thought too was to use a circuit away from the FPGA - and a VCXO sounds
like a viable approach. Would it also be possible to have one clock as the
master for the entire system? I was googling and came across one of the
basic LM567 circuits...but for this project I'm sure that there is too much
'tolerance' in an IC like that.

As for Jeroen's approach in terms of having the FPGA just generate the data
that's needed for JACK...I'm not sure why I wasn't thinking of it that way!
A lot of things fell into place in my head when this was mentioned, so I've
started looking at the netsource.c file from the JACK source code (JACK1 for
now) to begin to understand how the packets are sent and received. For the
JACK programmers - based around this file, what other parts of the source
code should I be looking at?

Thanks everyone,

Dan
