 Fons,

 The clock generated by the DPLL is not intended as the sampling clock:

In fact, my idea was to use one of the FPGA analog PLLs with slow loop
setting to lock onto the
jittery (but not as jittery as the sync packets) DPLL output. So I will be
using the FPGA analog PLL as a VCO.

The main question remains whether or not the PLL will be able to properly
lock on a DPLL output signal that is - indeed - fairly jittery. That
probably calls for an experiment.

What jitter performance would actually be required by pro-audio ?
