Thanks for the info on the TC DICE chip John - I've been checking it out,
and also noticed that the JetPLL 'code' is available on license. Of course
that would add expense, so I understand why you would use just that part of
the chip for the timing. As yet, I've not found 'the' JetPLL chip (if they
make it), so I'll dig a bit further into TC's website.

The abilities of even the DICE mini chip are impressive, and somewhat
relevant to this project. It's definitely worth keeping in mind!

Whilst doing a bit of Googling, I came across this manufacturer:

http://www.vectron.com/products/vcxo/vcxo_index.htm

Would some of their ICs be of use for this project? I can't find the price
of a DICE chip, but it may be possible to find a more specific solution, so
maybe we wouldn't need to compromise with a more expensive option.

I'll also take a look at the circuit boards of the video capture cards we
have at work, and see what they have. It may also be worth us studying some
of the other audio manufacturers' implementations, to see if there's a
particular trend, and why.
