Subject:     [Jack-Devel] How to use Jack in Windows as intermediate between an application and DarwinStreamingServer

Hello,

I have just finished installing Jack 1.9.8(32bit) on my Windows XP and I 
tested it by connecting the microphone to the speakers and all seems to 
be working fine so I should be able to start using Jack, but I do not 
exactly how.

The task I want to fulfill is something like this: I have an application 
that runs on a server in more that one instance and I want to be able to 
stream the sound from this application to different clients in real 
time. I was able to achieve this by using virtual audio drivers, set the 
output for my application to one of this drivers and use that driver as 
an input for a streamer like VLC that encodes the sound and sends it via 
DarwinStreamingServer to the client. This is working, the quality is OK, 
but the problem is that sometimes I get a huge delay on the client(up to 
several seconds) and because I stream the video as well this delay is 
unacceptable.
I was thinking of replacing  this chain by Jack and use a different port 
for different instances of the application, capture the sound, encode it 
and streams the audio via same DSS. The thing is I do not know what 
should I do to be able to create a new port and make my application use 
it as the output for it's audio. The encoding and streaming should not 
bee to hard, I could use FFMpeg for example.

That was at least the original plan, but if anyone has a different 
solution I am more than glad to hear it.

Thank you.
Regards,
Mihai.
