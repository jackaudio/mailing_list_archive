&gt; I have just finished installing Jack 1.9.8(32bit) on my Windows XP and I
&gt; tested it by connecting the microphone to the speakers and all seems to
&gt; be working fine so I should be able to start using Jack, but I do not
&gt; exactly how.
&gt;
&gt; The task I want to fulfill is something like this: I have an application
&gt; that runs on a server in more that one instance and I want to be able to
&gt; stream the sound from this application to different clients in real
&gt; time. I was able to achieve this by using virtual audio drivers, set the
&gt; output for my application to one of this drivers and use that driver as
&gt; an input for a streamer like VLC that encodes the sound and sends it via
&gt; DarwinStreamingServer to the client. This is working, the quality is OK,
&gt; but the problem is that sometimes I get a huge delay on the client(up to
&gt; several seconds) and because I stream the video as well this delay is
&gt; unacceptable.
&gt; I was thinking of replacing  this chain by Jack and use a different port
&gt; for different instances of the application, capture the sound, encode it
&gt; and streams the audio via same DSS. The thing is I do not know what
&gt; should I do to be able to create a new port and make my application use
&gt; it as the output for it's audio. The encoding and streaming should not
&gt; bee to hard, I could use FFMpeg for example.
&gt;
&gt; That was at least the original plan, but if anyone has a different
&gt; solution I am more than glad to hear it.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Mihai.

Hi Mihai,

When using Jack for Windows you have two driver options for connecting
sound: the native Jack API, and ASIO (using the JackRouter library).
These driver APIs will connect the sound outputs from the application
into the Jack Audio Server. Sound inputs to application from Jack are
also handled via the Jack API or ASIO. I am not sure whether you are
sending the audio over a network (in which case you would be using
Jack NetDriver to send/receive audio between two Jack Audio Servers).

I am just a user of Jack, so if you need specific pointers on how to
integrate the Jack API driver or ASIO you will need to hear that from
someone else.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
