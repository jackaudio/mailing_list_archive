Hi Mihai,

When using Jack for Windows you have two driver options for connecting
sound: the native Jack API, and ASIO (using the JackRouter library).
These driver APIs will connect the sound outputs from the application
into the Jack Audio Server. Sound inputs to application from Jack are
also handled via the Jack API or ASIO. I am not sure whether you are
sending the audio over a network (in which case you would be using
Jack NetDriver to send/receive audio between two Jack Audio Servers).

I am just a user of Jack, so if you need specific pointers on how to
integrate the Jack API driver or ASIO you will need to hear that from
someone else.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
