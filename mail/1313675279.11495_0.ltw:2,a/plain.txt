It depends on whether the required frequencies are available.
Audio ADC and DAC ICs typically require 128x or 256x fs for MCLK.
It would be worth reading data sheets for some of the widely
used converter chips to get an idea of what is required. The
AK5394A (ADC) and AK4395 (DAC) from Asahi Kasei EMD (www.akemd.com)
would be good examples as they are so widely used in pro audio 
equipment.

The VCXOs from Tent Labs are very good but expensive:

They are also available in a complete PLL PCB which is useful
for R&D purposes:

I've used some of their XO2 modules in converters I've modified, and
am planning to use a couple of their VCXOs in a mastering grade converter
I'm designing for my own use.

Be aware that video capture has different requirements which might
not be appropriate for high end audio.

IIRC, DICE is used in the Presonus Digimax FS and Focusrite Octapre II.
Both of those are ADAT interfaces, but until recently equipment at that
price level would not have had such sophisticated PLLs for clock
recovery. 

My SSL Alpha Link uses AK4117VF chips for external clock sync
and my old Lavry AD-10 used an AK4115VF (I'm not sure if the Lavry
had additional jitter attenuation stages after that, as it sounded
very good whatever the clock source). Both of these use a pair of 
fixed frequency XOs for internal clock.
