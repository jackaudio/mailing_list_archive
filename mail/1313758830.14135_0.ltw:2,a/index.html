&gt; &gt; oh well... at least i dont need to feel bad, because netjack2 isnt&gt; working
either.&gt; i dont really remember why its using netjack_poll()
&gt; 
&gt; the reason why netone fails, is that it calls netjack_poll which is not
&gt; implemented for windows, and then bails out because of it.however... it is not
necessary to call it.(at least not on Windows) ...
&gt; 
&gt; &#xA0;
&gt; I managed to compile jackd2 1.9.8 from SVN 4473. I removed the Ubuntu 11.04
jackd2 package so I could register the shared libraries.
&gt; &#xA0;
&gt; I regret to inform Torben that netjack1 on Windows does not connect, whereas
netjack2 does.
&gt; &#xA0;
&gt; I now have two questions:
&gt; &#xA0;
&gt; 1. How do I get qjackctl installed in Ubuntu, without having jackd (1.9.7)
installed as well ?&#xA0;(or maybe: how do I replace an installed jackd2 1.9.7 with
1.9.8)
&gt; &#xA0;
&gt; 2. I would like to resolve the 'Initing net driver fails...' problem. Any
clues for where to look ? What toolchain do I need to build (looks like
Code::Blocks is needed) ? 
&gt; &#xA0;
&gt; Thanks for your help.

Hi,

I was looking for a way to use NetJack1 either on a mixed linux/windows
environment, or a pure windows environment.
I'm experiencing the same "netjack_poll not implemented" problem when launching
jack2 on windows with the netone driver. I'm using jack 1.9.7.

It seems that, from your last message, jack2 1.9.8 from SVN doesn't work better.
Have you found with any solution/workaround?

One more thing: when running the master on windows, and linux as the "netone"
slave, things seems to be well connected, but I cannot get any sound out.
Windows firewall is disabled. I just get a lot of "send: No error" in the
jack_netsource" output on windows. Versions of jackd are identical on linux and
windows. Any clue?

netjack1 seems to be very interesting, and I'm working on a project which aims
to popularize it so that every musicians, even under windows, can use it.

any clue appreciated.

Thanks,
cheers,


micha&#xEB;l
