Hi,

I was looking for a way to use NetJack1 either on a mixed linux/windows
environment, or a pure windows environment.
I'm experiencing the same "netjack_poll not implemented" problem when launching
jack2 on windows with the netone driver. I'm using jack 1.9.7.

It seems that, from your last message, jack2 1.9.8 from SVN doesn't work better.
Have you found with any solution/workaround?

One more thing: when running the master on windows, and linux as the "netone"
slave, things seems to be well connected, but I cannot get any sound out.
Windows firewall is disabled. I just get a lot of "send: No error" in the
jack_netsource" output on windows. Versions of jackd are identical on linux and
windows. Any clue?

netjack1 seems to be very interesting, and I'm working on a project which aims
to popularize it so that every musicians, even under windows, can use it.

any clue appreciated.

Thanks,
cheers,


michaël
