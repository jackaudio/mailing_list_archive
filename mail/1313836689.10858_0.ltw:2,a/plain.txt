Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Building Fluidsynth 1.1.4 on Windows with Jack for Windows Support

Hi,

I am pleased to report that I have a successful compile and a working
fluidsynth library using Jack for Windows 1.9.8 with Fluidsynth 1.1.4.

One critical change was needed in fluid_jack.c, I replaced

 free (jack_ports);  /* free jack ports array (not the port values!) */

with :

   jack_free (jack_ports);  /* free jack ports array (not the port values!) */

Thank you Stephane for your advice when I originally attempted this
build in 2009, as you pointed out this was a new function added in
JACK2 for Windows users :

/**
  * The free function to be used on memory returned by
jack_port_get_connections,
  * jack_port_get_all_connections and jack_get_ports functions.
  * This is MANDATORY on Windows when otherwise all nasty runtime
version related crashes can occur.
  * Developers are strongly encouraged to use this function instead of
the standard "free" function in new code.
  *
  */
void jack_free(void* ptr);


I will be testing my build for a few days and if there are no major
issues I will then upload 32-bit and 64-bit builds of both Fluidsynth
and Qsynth for others to test, as well as libraries for jOrgan users
to test.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
