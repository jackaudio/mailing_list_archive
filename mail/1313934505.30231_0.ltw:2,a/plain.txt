Subject:     [Jack-Devel] VideoJACK

Hey All,

I wasn't aware that patches existed to route video around JACK... although
the idea has been on list a couple of times before IIRC.
I'm aware the patches are pretty outdated at this stage, but if work was to
be done in this area would mainline JACK versions be open
to taking it into upstream?

I personally would love this feature, as it would open the world of video
effect programming & mashing up to a new level. I'm sure there are downsides
to integrating video into JACK too and I'm also intrested in hearing those.
