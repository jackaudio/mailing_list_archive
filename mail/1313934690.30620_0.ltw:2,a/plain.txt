this has been asked before, yes. the core developers of JACK (that
includes me) were not happy with the specific way that the guys who
did videojack went about it. we think that the general idea of video
for jack is excellent. but the implementation would need to change in
fairly fundamental ways for it be merged into any mainline version of
JACK. i don't currently recall what the fundamental problems where.
