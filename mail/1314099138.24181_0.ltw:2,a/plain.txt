Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack-transport state change notification

Hi,

I'm currently reworking the jacktransport plugin for puredata to
accomodate the changes in the api in the last years (the old plugin is
from 2005). The mechanism seems to be clear, but I'd like to confirm
that I'm doing it the right way:

In order to intercept changes in the transport state I assume the
client has to poll jack (with jack_transport_query) or is there a
mechanism for installing a callback enabling clients to get informed
by jack that transport state has changed (e.g. if another application
stops jack transport)?

I'm well aware about the sync callback for slow syncing clients but as
far as I understood it only gets invoked if the transport is relocated
or am I missing something?

Thanks for any comments,
Orm
