There are two aspects to this, precision and error probability.

The precision depends on a phase measurement done at 1/16 of
the sample rate. This produces a delay value in the range
[0..16) samples. The real value is course this one plus k * 16
samples, k integer. For a decent audio card the precision will
be around 1/1000 of a sample, it depends mostly on S/N ratio.

Phase measurements on additional frequencies are used to find
the value of k. Each such measurement multiplies the unambiguous
range by a value of N. In the original version of jdelay (which
is the code used by jack_iodelay) N = 8. This is done in such
a way that small errors in the phase measurement have no effect
at all - the value is compared to N expected ones and the nearest
one is chosen. The system also checks for consistency between
the results. 

If the audio channel has a delay that is reasonably independent
of frequency no such errors will occur until the signal is really
very bad. But with N = 8 they are possible if you have things
like equalisers in the signal chain.

The latest release of jack_delay uses N = 2, which of course
requires more frequencies for the same range, but tolerates
much larger frequency-dependent delays.
