Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack for Windows - Fluidsynth Native Jack Clients 32bit and 64-bit

Hi,

In building Fluidsynth with Jack support for Windows I have come
across a question that is beyond my limited understanding of coding
and environments.

Is it possible to have a 32-bit Fluidsynth-Jack client connect to the
64-bit Jack Audio Server?

I know that Stephane was able to create a JackRouter (ASIO->Jack) that
works with both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. But, Fluidsynth 32-bit
uses libjack.dll and Fluidsynth 64-bit uses libjack64.dll.... so I'm
not sure how that affects things in a 32-bit AND 64-bit situation.

My apologies if this is a programming 101 issue.

Kind regards,
