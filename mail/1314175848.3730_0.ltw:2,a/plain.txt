Yes sure : 64 bits JACK server can be accessed from 32 and 64 bits clients. The reverse is also true.

- 32 bits JackRouter is linked to libjack.dll and will be used by 32 bits applications to access the server (which is itself 32 or 64 bits)

- 64 bits JackRouter is linked to libjack64.dll and will be used by 64 bits applications to access the server (which is itself 32 or 64 bits)

With the same idea:

-  Fluidsynth 32-bits will be used by 32 bits applications  to access the server (which is itself 32 or 64 bits)

-  Fluidsynth 64-bits will be used by 64 bits applications  to access the server (which is itself 32 or 64 bits)
