I did stay with 1.9.7 for a number of reasons:

- Hauptwerk has a 32-bit version too, which suits me fine.
- On Linux, I can build Jack 1.9.8 with no problems but on Windows, I did
get all sources, incl. ASIO, but was unable to compile Jack with
Code::Blocks. I simply gave up trying to figure out the problems. I also
found no useful instructions to build the .dlls (apparently you need MS
Visual Studio, and I do not own that).
- 1.9.7 is available prepackaged in Debian and Ubuntu, along with scripts to
setup the realtime user and to start the Pulse Audio Suspender
(pasuspender).

I used netjack2.

On the Linux server side (which has MIDI input from the keyboard and has an
audio output) I use:

$ pasuspender -- jackd -R -dalsa -p256 -r44100 -Xseq
$ jack_load netmanager

(both commands in a different terminal)


On the Windows Vista 64 client side, I do:

- Start loopMIDI. Just close its window as it remains running in the system
tray.

- Start Hauptwerk. It will complain that some components (the JackRouter)
could not be loaded. Click 'continue'. Hauptwerk is now holding the MIDI
input, preventing jackd from gobbling it up..

- Open command prompt (cmd.exe) 1 in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.7'
and run:
&gt; jackd -R -S -X winmme -dnet -i1 -C0 -P2
  Command prompt 1 is now busy, having been unable to lock down the MIDI
port we need (midiInOpen error).

- Leave Hauptwerk.

- Open command prompt 2 in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.7'.
&gt; jack_load audioadapter

- Restart Hauptwerk.

- In General Settings, select JackRouter.

- Load an instrument. Hauptwerk outputs will now become available.

- In command prompt 2:
    jack_connect Hauptwerk:out1 system:playback_1
    jack_connect Hauptwerk:out2 system:playback_2
    jack_connect system:midi_capture_1 system_midi:playback_2


And then finally I can route MIDI and audio using qjackctl:

Audio: WindowsClient ==&gt; system
MIDI: system:midi_capture_2 ==&gt; WindowsClient:midi_to_slave_1


When playing the keyboard the Linux Jack server sends the MIDI data using
NetJack2 to one end of the Windows client loopMIDI. The other end is held by
Hauptwerk, which eventually gets the MIDI command. Hauptwerk makes a sound
through the ASIO adapter, which merely sends it to the client's
audioadapter, which in turn resamples it to match the sample rate of the
master. The master receives this synchronous stream over NetJack2 and feeds
it to its local audio card.

Easy as that...

Still, sometimes this setup just ceases to work properly. I haven't been
able to figure out what causes the problem.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; oh well... at least i dont need to feel bad, because netjack2 isnt&gt;
&gt; working
&gt; either.&gt; i dont really remember why its using netjack_poll()
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the reason why netone fails, is that it calls netjack_poll which is not
&gt; &gt; implemented for windows, and then bails out because of it.however... it
&gt; is not
&gt; necessary to call it.(at least not on Windows) ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I managed to compile jackd2 1.9.8 from SVN 4473. I removed the Ubuntu
&gt; 11.04
&gt; jackd2 package so I could register the shared libraries.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I regret to inform Torben that netjack1 on Windows does not connect,
&gt; whereas
&gt; netjack2 does.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I now have two questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. How do I get qjackctl installed in Ubuntu, without having jackd
&gt; (1.9.7)
&gt; installed as well ? (or maybe: how do I replace an installed jackd2 1.9.7
&gt; with
&gt; 1.9.8)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. I would like to resolve the 'Initing net driver fails...' problem. Any
&gt; clues for where to look ? What toolchain do I need to build (looks like
&gt; Code::Blocks is needed) ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I was looking for a way to use NetJack1 either on a mixed linux/windows
&gt; environment, or a pure windows environment.
&gt; I'm experiencing the same "netjack_poll not implemented" problem when
&gt; launching
&gt; jack2 on windows with the netone driver. I'm using jack 1.9.7.
&gt;
&gt; It seems that, from your last message, jack2 1.9.8 from SVN doesn't work
&gt; better.
&gt; Have you found with any solution/workaround?
&gt;
&gt; One more thing: when running the master on windows, and linux as the
&gt; "netone"
&gt; slave, things seems to be well connected, but I cannot get any sound out.
&gt; Windows firewall is disabled. I just get a lot of "send: No error" in the
&gt; jack_netsource" output on windows. Versions of jackd are identical on linux
&gt; and
&gt; windows. Any clue?
&gt;
&gt; netjack1 seems to be very interesting, and I'm working on a project which
&gt; aims
&gt; to popularize it so that every musicians, even under windows, can use it.
&gt;
&gt; any clue appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; cheers,
&gt;
&gt;
