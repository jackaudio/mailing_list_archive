Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Mixed Windows / Linux system

I did stay with 1.9.7 for a number of reasons:

- Hauptwerk has a 32-bit version too, which suits me fine.
- On Linux, I can build Jack 1.9.8 with no problems but on Windows, I did
get all sources, incl. ASIO, but was unable to compile Jack with
Code::Blocks. I simply gave up trying to figure out the problems. I also
found no useful instructions to build the .dlls (apparently you need MS
Visual Studio, and I do not own that).
- 1.9.7 is available prepackaged in Debian and Ubuntu, along with scripts to
setup the realtime user and to start the Pulse Audio Suspender
(pasuspender).

I used netjack2.

On the Linux server side (which has MIDI input from the keyboard and has an
audio output) I use:

$ pasuspender -- jackd -R -dalsa -p256 -r44100 -Xseq
$ jack_load netmanager

(both commands in a different terminal)


On the Windows Vista 64 client side, I do:

- Start loopMIDI. Just close its window as it remains running in the system
tray.

- Start Hauptwerk. It will complain that some components (the JackRouter)
could not be loaded. Click 'continue'. Hauptwerk is now holding the MIDI
input, preventing jackd from gobbling it up..

- Open command prompt (cmd.exe) 1 in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.7'
and run:
> jackd -R -S -X winmme -dnet -i1 -C0 -P2
  Command prompt 1 is now busy, having been unable to lock down the MIDI
port we need (midiInOpen error).

- Leave Hauptwerk.

- Open command prompt 2 in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.7'.
> jack_load audioadapter

- Restart Hauptwerk.

- In General Settings, select JackRouter.

- Load an instrument. Hauptwerk outputs will now become available.

- In command prompt 2:
    jack_connect Hauptwerk:out1 system:playback_1
    jack_connect Hauptwerk:out2 system:playback_2
    jack_connect system:midi_capture_1 system_midi:playback_2


And then finally I can route MIDI and audio using qjackctl:

Audio: WindowsClient ==> system
MIDI: system:midi_capture_2 ==> WindowsClient:midi_to_slave_1


When playing the keyboard the Linux Jack server sends the MIDI data using
NetJack2 to one end of the Windows client loopMIDI. The other end is held by
Hauptwerk, which eventually gets the MIDI command. Hauptwerk makes a sound
through the ASIO adapter, which merely sends it to the client's
audioadapter, which in turn resamples it to match the sample rate of the
master. The master receives this synchronous stream over NetJack2 and feeds
it to its local audio card.

Easy as that...

Still, sometimes this setup just ceases to work properly. I haven't been
able to figure out what causes the problem.
