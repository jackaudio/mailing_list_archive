I set the process callback in the plugin calling
jack_set_process_callback, but the callback never gets called. I guess
that's because the plugin doesn't process any data.

The plugin is connected to jack with jack_client_open and afterwards
activated with jack_activate. As the plugin isn't supposed to process
any audio or midi (it's just for setting and reading transport state
and position) I'm not sure what I should do to make jack invoke the
process callback.

As of now I just resorted to do polling myself, which works and
probably is precise enough for my needs, but I'd like to do it right
if there is a canonical way.
