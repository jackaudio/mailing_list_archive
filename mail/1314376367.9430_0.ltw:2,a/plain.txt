netjack2 is in heady rework in Jack 1.9.8 (with some optimization, like sending data only when JACK ports are really connected to save bandwidth). I hope to have something ready soon.

The other end is held by Hauptwerk, which eventually gets the MIDI command. Hauptwerk makes a sound through the ASIO adapter, which merely sends it to the client's audioadapter, which in turn resamples it to match the sample rate of the master. The master receives this synchronous stream over NetJack2 and feeds it to its local audio card.
