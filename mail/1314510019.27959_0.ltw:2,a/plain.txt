Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Client deactivation behavior

Hello,

I'm in the middle of testing a new version of `synthclone`, and I'm
noticing what I believe is incorrect behavior in JACK 1 (0.120.2 on
AVLinux).

Intermittently, I notice that the process callback will still be
executing after jack_deactivate() returns, and `synthclone` will
segfault in the process callback in a call to jack_port_get_buffer().
I don't know if the process callback is called before the call to
jack_deactivate() and jack_deactivate() isn't waiting for it to
finish, or if the process callback is being called after
jack_deactivate() returns.

Before filing a bug, I want to make sure this is not expected behavior
and that this isn't fixed in newer versions of JACK.  I'll try a newer
version tomorrow if this isn't cleared up by then.

Thanks in advance,
