To be clear: I don't believe the segfault in the process callback is
happening in jack_port_get_buffer() because of anything
jack_port_get_buffer() is doing wrong.  The segfault is happening
because I call jack_deactivate(), and then free resources that are
used in the process callback (port arrays).
