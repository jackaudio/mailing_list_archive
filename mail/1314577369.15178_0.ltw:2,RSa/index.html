So, while we continue the discussion as to which hardware to go with for
this project, I've been looking into the code with my minimal knowledge of
C. Given my lack of experience, I wanted to clarify that I'm looking at the
right elements of the JACK code, and whether I need to refer to these parts
at all if I'm only creating the relevant data.

The central point of my investigations has been on netjack_packet.c - from
JACK1. The first 518 lines seem to show what I want to be looking at, if
indeed I need to be that JACK-specific!

I've been reading up on UDP, and having the FPGA write data into UDP packets
would be quite simple I'd imagine, given the simplified structure of a UDP
packet compared to, say, TCP.

This is where I need the advice of those who are experienced with the inner
workings of netJACK:

If JACK sends uncompressed audio, is it in a particular format (WAV or raw
PCM)?

Assuming that both the master and slave are connected to each other and no
further identification needs to be made, what data does JACK send along with
that audio data?

At more of an opinion level, if I were to use this for our 8-channel system,
would each channel be dealt with in separate packets (series processing), or
should one packet send data from all eight channels (parallel processing)?

Again, if I have missed the scope of anything hear, please let me know, and
I'll do some more relevant research - this is still very new to me, as you
can probably tell :-)

Thanks for your help!

&gt; I've been reading the manual for the Altera DE1 board, and given its
&gt; expense, would it be worth looking into finding a used one to work with on
&gt; this project? I appears to have two clock sources of its own (27 and 50MHz),
&gt; and the expansion connectors would provide me with (more than enough) the
&gt; inputs we'd require to connect from the ADC. Maybe, if the clocks on the dev
&gt; board are good enough, we could use those in our project-specific version of
&gt; the circuit.
&gt;
&gt; It also has an array of LEDs and 7-segment displays, so there's the option
&gt; of programming activity lights and numerical read-outs (for the sample rate,
&gt; for example) further down the line.
&gt;
&gt; I keep watching youtube videos on the Quartus software, and it looks more
&gt; and more appealing to program this way. I suppose I need to start saving up!
&gt;
&gt; However, there is also the Xilinx-based board that Jeri recommended to me
&gt; in the first instance (the Avenet LX9 micro board) is a lot cheaper, but
&gt; because everyone has been discussing mainly the Altera products, I've not
&gt; looked into their feasibility, and whether they would be more or less
&gt; difficult to work with than the Cyclone boards. Their cost is less, so it's
&gt; still something I've been considering.
&gt;
&gt; I'll continue to look for sources on good clock sources, but thanks
&gt; everyone so far for the discussions and the experience!

&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, my idea was to use one of the FPGA analog PLLs with slow loop
&gt;&gt; &gt; setting to lock onto the
&gt;&gt; &gt; jittery (but not as jittery as the sync packets) DPLL output. So I will
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt; using the FPGA analog PLL as a VCO.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The main question remains whether or not the PLL will be able to
&gt;&gt; properly
&gt;&gt; &gt; lock on a DPLL output signal that is - indeed - fairly jittery. That
&gt;&gt; &gt; probably calls for an experiment.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That indeed remains to be seen. You can probably make it lock, the
&gt;&gt; question is what BW it requires.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyway creating a master sample clock from low frequency sync
&gt;&gt; messages using a PLL is not easy. But since you have the computing
&gt;&gt; power of an FPGA at your disposal there are alternatives in the
&gt;&gt; form of open-loop solutions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Put a timestamp (using the current clock) on the sync messages,
&gt;&gt; unwrap any modulo on the time stamps and perform a linear
&gt;&gt; regression on a few hundred of them - this is equivalent to
&gt;&gt; filtering in a PLL but doesn't have the stability problems
&gt;&gt; as it is open loop. Repeat for each incoming sync packet,
&gt;&gt; low-pass filter the result to drive a VC(X)O.
