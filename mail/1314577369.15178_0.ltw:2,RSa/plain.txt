Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Ethernet-based audio interface using (net)jack idea

So, while we continue the discussion as to which hardware to go with for
this project, I've been looking into the code with my minimal knowledge of
C. Given my lack of experience, I wanted to clarify that I'm looking at the
right elements of the JACK code, and whether I need to refer to these parts
at all if I'm only creating the relevant data.

The central point of my investigations has been on netjack_packet.c - from
JACK1. The first 518 lines seem to show what I want to be looking at, if
indeed I need to be that JACK-specific!

I've been reading up on UDP, and having the FPGA write data into UDP packets
would be quite simple I'd imagine, given the simplified structure of a UDP
packet compared to, say, TCP.

This is where I need the advice of those who are experienced with the inner
workings of netJACK:

If JACK sends uncompressed audio, is it in a particular format (WAV or raw
PCM)?

Assuming that both the master and slave are connected to each other and no
further identification needs to be made, what data does JACK send along with
that audio data?

At more of an opinion level, if I were to use this for our 8-channel system,
would each channel be dealt with in separate packets (series processing), or
should one packet send data from all eight channels (parallel processing)?

Again, if I have missed the scope of anything hear, please let me know, and
I'll do some more relevant research - this is still very new to me, as you
can probably tell :-)

Thanks for your help!
