Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack PortAudio driver options

Hi Stéphane,

In compiling PortAudio support for fluidsynth I have found that WDMKS
and WASAPI offer great low latency for the audio stream. When running
the jackd -d portaudio -l command to get the list of supported device
drivers I do not see WDM-Kernel Streaming listed. Would it be possible
to compile that portion of PortAudio for Jack PortAudio use?

I am using the latest SVN of portaudio for fluidsynth and it looks
like backward compatibility has been broken as Jack is unable to start
the server if I simply copy in the portaudio_x86.dll that I have
compiled.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
