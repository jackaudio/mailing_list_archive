Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Latencies...

Hi All,

I the process of looking at latencies stuff again, I saw that even on OSX (when latencies are somewhat reported by the CoreAudio driver itself...), we end up with differences between what is measured by the jack_iodelay tool, and what is reported by jack_lsp -l

I came also across this paper: http://cluster.inf-ra.uni-jena.de/~adi/icimt10.pdf

But more fundamentally, would il make sense to add an option in jack_iodelay tool to automatically "adjust" all physical I/O port latencies? (after the measurement has been made...)? So that a user would typically launch JACK, start  jack_iodelay with this special option and then I/O latencies would be correct?

Or we could even imagine a more integrated way of using jack_iodelay code to do the job at JACK server launch time?

Comments?

Stéphane
