So that a user would typically launch JACK, start  jack_iodelay with this special option and then I/O latencies would be correct?

this seems potentially useful, indeed. but ...

we could imagine it, but since its use requires a rather odd/unusual
physical connection setup (to create a loopback), it seems that it
could not really be used by most people most of the time.

this applies equally to your first idea, which would require a
loopback on every physical port, which i know for me is totally
unrealistic (RME Digiface).
