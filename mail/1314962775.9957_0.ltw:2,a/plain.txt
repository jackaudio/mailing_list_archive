this paper seems very odd to me. it seems to be a paper about a bug,
and proposes a fix that doesn't actually fix the bug. its also got two
other significant issues: (1) its based on the old latency API (2) it
(almost necessarily) ignores the complexities of latency compensation
in a system with arbitrary data graphs, which are MUCH greater than in
systems where the only signal flow is to/from the audio interface h/w.
