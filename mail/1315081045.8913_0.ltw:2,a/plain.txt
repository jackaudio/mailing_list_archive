This is not expected behavior.  jack_deactivate() should be 
synchronous... that is, it should not return until the process() cycle 
is complete.

FWIW, if JACK 0.120.2 actually exhibits this bug... all hell would be 
breaking loose with every JACK app... not just yours.

I suggest updating the the latest JACK.  If the bug persists, create a 
test case that demonstrates the bug and post it to this list.

There is a bug tracking system on jackaudio.org -- but none of the Jack 
1 devs use it.  So this ML is the way to file any bugs.
