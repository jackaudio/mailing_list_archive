very few USB devices can support 16kHz. JACK itself does not do sample
rate conversion. if you want to force this, use plughw:1 and not hw:1.

also, please do not use the -C and -P arguments. they are intended
only to be used when using different devices for capture and playback,
and even then they are not a very good idea. just -d alsa -dplughw:1
will work.
