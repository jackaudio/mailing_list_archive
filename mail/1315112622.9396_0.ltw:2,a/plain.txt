I did a bit more experimentation throughout the week, and could only
get this bug to occur when:

1.) (The new version of) `synthclone` is running in debug mode from QtCreator.
2.) JACK functionality is contained in a Qt plugin.
3.) JACK 0.120.2 (from AV Linux) is installed.
4.) A call to jack_deactivate() is closely followed by freeing
resources used in the process callback.

I couldn't get the bug to show itself under any other circumstances.
If I don't use debug mode, make JACK calls in the main executable, use
a different version of JACK, change the code to use
jack_client_close() instead of jack_deactivate(), or wait to free
resources, then everything runs fine.

Hmmm.  I can now confirm that updating QtCreator also makes the bug go away.

I'm confused, but I'm pretty certain this isn't a bug in JACK.

Sorry for any trouble/confusion I may have caused (aside from my own).
