&gt; This is where I need the advice of those who are experienced with the inner

Disclaimer: I'm not, but since nobody has answered your question, I took
a brief look at the code.

&gt; If JACK sends uncompressed audio, is it in a particular format (WAV or raw
&gt; PCM)?

WAV is a file header and obviously not a valid answer. PCM sounds a lot
better. ;)

If you check netjack_packet.c, there's render_jack_ports_to_payload().
Depending on the required bitdepth, it either encodes audio data as
8bit, 16bit or float. In the float case, those are either native floats
(depending on the host CPU) or treated as int32 and then converted to
network byte order.

Given that you're creating a locally attached soundcard, aim for
float32le. "le" is little endian, most of your target CPUs will use them.

MIDI is encoded as uint32_t in network byte order (see
encode_midi_buffer).


&gt; Assuming that both the master and slave are connected to each other and no
&gt; further identification needs to be made, what data does JACK send along with
&gt; that audio data?

MIDI data and, if run in autoconfig mode, a first packet that configures
the system. This is probably something neat that you might want to use
if your box is going to be the jackd master.

&gt; At more of an opinion level, if I were to use this for our 8-channel
&gt; system, would each channel be dealt with in separate packets (series
&gt; processing), or should one packet send data from all eight channels
&gt; (parallel processing)?

That's actually not the question you want to ask. What you want to know
is how to distribute the samples in the stream. netjack sends a given
amount (nframes) of the first channel, then followed by the same amount
of frames for the second channel and so on.

If the payload is too large for a single packet, another one will be
created.

So there's clearly no "a single packet per channel" concept. Better
think of a continous bitstream that's split into arbitrary chunks called
packets.

&gt; Again, if I have missed the scope of anything hear, please let me know, and
&gt; I'll do some more relevant research - this is still very new to me, as you
&gt; can probably tell :-)

How is it going? It seems you're new to C and new to VHDL. Frankly,
that's not exactly the best starting point for a hardware project. Do
you have somebody to ask in case of trouble? Like a supervisor?
