Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Looking for Testers for 64-bit Jack for Windows

Hi Jose,

Jack for Windows WinMME MIDI driver takes over your Windows MIDI ports (that
are available when it starts).

Most MIDI drivers only allow one program to access them at once, so after Jack
for Windows has acquired the MIDI port, no other program can access it directly.

Unless your Windows programs are written to use Jack for Windows' MIDI API, you
probably do no want to use the Jack for Windows WinMME MIDI driver.

(What is needed is a virtual MIDI driver that exposes the Jack for Windows MIDI
ports back to the Windows OS as both 32bit and 64bit accessible devices.
Ideally a way to control which ports Jack acquired would be good, too.)

Regards,

-- Peter
