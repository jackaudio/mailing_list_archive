Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Debugging Jack Clients

Hi,
   Forgive me fi this has been asked before, but the tux archives seem to be
broken (not responding) for me.

I'm developing a Jack client on Linux (using the jackd sever with the ALSA
backend), and need to be able to debug the client application.  How do you
go about this in Jack?  I'm trying this:

# jackd -d alsa .... <startup options>.... &
# gdb my_client_app

When I hit a breakpoint in my_client_app, the jack server barfs and quits,
and therefore I can't continue on.

Is there any way to debug client apps with breakpoints and continue?

Thanks,
  -Caleb
