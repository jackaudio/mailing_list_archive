Arrrrg! Jack-session rm -R killed me!

when saving session, I though it was a wise idea to create a symlink
to my application data (audio takes) so I can still work on the same
directory and have session save/restore without copying huge amount of
data.

Saving the same session twice will wipe all the audio takes under the
link target.
