Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack session save/restore work-flow

Good day everyone,

I am implementing support for jack session for my client meterec and
have a few queries.

In my opinion, when saving a session, 3 type of data should be stored:
- command line options (extracted from current application invocation)
- generated in the session callback in my client
- configuration file (extracted from current application state) -
generated in the session callback
- audio data (generated during this invocation or previous invocation
of the application) - symlink to that data created in the session
callback

I read somewhere the session folder should contain all these data or
link to them so it can be packed, and sent over to someone else to
work with. I also learned (with pain:) that the session folder content
is erased before storing the session data (qjackctl at least).

If the above is true, once unpacked, the user of the session will lose
all audio data when session is saved again...

Where should I store my data to avoid this situation?
Am I misinterpreting the usage of session?

Thanks,
Fabrice.
