&gt; Good day everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I am implementing support for jack session for my client meterec and
&gt; have a few queries.
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, when saving a session, 3 type of data should be stored:
&gt; - command line options (extracted from current application invocation)
&gt; - generated in the session callback in my client
&gt; - configuration file (extracted from current application state) -
&gt; generated in the session callback
&gt; - audio data (generated during this invocation or previous invocation
&gt; of the application) - symlink to that data created in the session
&gt; callback

dont use the callback for disk io please.
signal your main thread, and use jack_session_reply() from there.

&gt; I read somewhere the session folder should contain all these data or
&gt; link to them so it can be packed, and sent over to someone else to
&gt; work with. I also learned (with pain:) that the session folder content
&gt; is erased before storing the session data (qjackctl at least).
&gt; 
&gt; If the above is true, once unpacked, the user of the session will lose
&gt; all audio data when session is saved again...
&gt; 
&gt; Where should I store my data to avoid this situation?
&gt; Am I misinterpreting the usage of session?

this issue is pretty much unsolved.
there were thoughts about an import/export event, which would do this
kind of stuff.

you could add some logic, which remembered whether the files were
sitting inside a session directory, and then hardlink them into the new
session directory, before its removed.

(but this implies, that the SM doesnt delte the old directory, before
the save is complete, iirc qjackctl does it now, and pyjacksm was doing
that nayways)

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Fabrice.
