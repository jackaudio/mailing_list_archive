dont use the callback for disk io please.
signal your main thread, and use jack_session_reply() from there.

this issue is pretty much unsolved.
there were thoughts about an import/export event, which would do this
kind of stuff.

you could add some logic, which remembered whether the files were
sitting inside a session directory, and then hardlink them into the new
session directory, before its removed.

(but this implies, that the SM doesnt delte the old directory, before
the save is complete, iirc qjackctl does it now, and pyjacksm was doing
that nayways)
