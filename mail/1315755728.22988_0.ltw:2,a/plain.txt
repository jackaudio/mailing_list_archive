Subject:     [Jack-Devel] ASIO: Jackrouter missing in VstHost and Plogue Bidule.

Running Jack v1.9.8 for Windows.
When i have first started Jack and subsequently VstHost or Plogue 
Bidule, i cannot get them to "see" ASIO: Jackrouter as output port.

I get following error message in the jack window:

Cannot connect to named pipe = \\.\.pipe\client_jack_vsthost_0 err = 5
Cannot connect client pipe
Cannot connect to client name = vsthost

Similar with Plogue Bidule.

On the other hand when i launch SaviHost with a vst plugin, ASIO: 
Jackrouter is there under Device / Wave / Output Port.

How should i go about to have Jackrouter available in VstHost and 
Plogue-Bidule?

Thanks in advance for your input.

Erik.
