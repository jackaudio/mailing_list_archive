Hi Erik and friends,

I runned a quick test here after I saw your post.

Jack 1.9.8 for windows on my 64bit win7home premium
VSTHost 1.51 (latest).
I had bidule and other stuff of this kind but I put them away as with Reaper I'm great !

So, I opened first Jack doubleclicking the jack portaudio desktop icon.
Then I opened VSTHost x64. Opened devices option I saw Asio4all, Jackrouter and ReaRouteAsio.
Selecting Jackrouter everything works fine.
So, probably this is not a VSTHost problem......

Hope that helps a bit.....

Best
Panos

Running Jack v1.9.8 for Windows.
When i have first started Jack and subsequently VstHost or Plogue Bidule, i cannot get them to "see" ASIO: Jackrouter as output port.

I get following error message in the jack window:

Cannot connect to named pipe = \\.\.pipe\client_jack_vsthost_0 err = 5
Cannot connect client pipe
Cannot connect to client name = vsthost

Similar with Plogue Bidule.

On the other hand when i launch SaviHost with a vst plugin, ASIO: Jackrouter is there under Device / Wave / Output Port.

How should i go about to have Jackrouter available in VstHost and Plogue-Bidule?

Thanks in advance for your input.

Erik.
