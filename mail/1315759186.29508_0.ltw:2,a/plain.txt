Hello Panos, Graham and list members,

Please disregard my question.

I found the cause of the problem here:

I am running Windows 7 64 bit.
Jack was started with "normal" privileges, while VstHost and Bidule 
started with Admin privileges.
As soon as Jack was also started with Admin privileges Jackrouter is 
available in the VST Hosts programs.
All programs (Jack, Jack Control, any VST Host program) must run with 
equal privileges, either normal (which is  best i think) or admin.

Sorry to have bothered you with this question.

All the best.

Erik.
