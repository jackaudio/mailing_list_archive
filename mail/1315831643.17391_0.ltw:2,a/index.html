&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I have just finished installing Jack 1.9.8(32bit) on my Windows XP and I tested it by connecting the microphone to the speakers and all seems to be working fine so I should be able to start using Jack, but I do not exactly how.
&gt; 
&gt; The task I want to fulfill is something like this: I have an application that runs on a server in more that one instance and I want to be able to stream the sound from this application to different clients in real time.

Can this application be used with an ASIO driver? If yes, it can be "jackified " (that is become a Jack client) by using the JackRouter ASIO/JACK bridge.


&gt; I was able to achieve this by using virtual audio drivers, set the output for my application to one of this drivers and use that driver as an input for a streamer like VLC that encodes the sound and sends it via DarwinStreamingServer to the client. This is working, the quality is OK, but the problem is that sometimes I get a huge delay on the client(up to several seconds) and because I stream the video as well this delay is unacceptable.
&gt; I was thinking of replacing this chain by Jack and use a different port for different instances of the application, capture the sound, encode it and streams the audio via same DSS.
&gt; The thing is I do not know what should I do to be able to create a new port and make my application use it as the output for it's audio. The encoding and streaming should not bee to hard, I could use FFMpeg for example.


As a general remark, all applications you are going to use should be ASIO compatible for the setup to work.

&gt; 
&gt; That was at least the original plan, but if anyone has a different solution I am more than glad to hear it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Mihai.
