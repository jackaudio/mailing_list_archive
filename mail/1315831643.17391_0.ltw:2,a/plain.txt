Can this application be used with an ASIO driver? If yes, it can be "jackified " (that is become a Jack client) by using the JackRouter ASIO/JACK bridge.

This is working, the quality is OK, but the problem is that sometimes I get a huge delay on the client(up to several seconds) and because I stream the video as well this delay is unacceptable.

As a general remark, all applications you are going to use should be ASIO compatible for the setup to work.
