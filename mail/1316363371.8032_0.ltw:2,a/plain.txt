Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JackRouter crash (windows, jack64)

Hi. Im testing this new 64 bits version for windows
JackRouter causes program to crash after setting JackRouter.ini to:



[IO]
input=64
output=64

[AUTO_CONNECT]
input=0
output=0



And this is the jackd message:



Cannot read named pipe err = 109
HandleRequest: cannot read header



Peace.
Jose.
