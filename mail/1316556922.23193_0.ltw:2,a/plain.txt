Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK audio format

Hi,

Is it possible to modify JACK to support different internal sample formats,
instead of only single precision floating point?
For example, have an argument to set the sample format during runtime?  Or
would this only be possible at compile time?

I'm asking because I am considering running JACK on an embedded system that
support 16 bit format to the alsa driver.  ALSA plugin is doing a conversion
from S16 bit audio files to floating point, and then converting back to 16
bit when writing to the alsa driver.  I'm wondering how much cpu usage would
be reduced by using a fixed point format internally in JACK.

Thanks
