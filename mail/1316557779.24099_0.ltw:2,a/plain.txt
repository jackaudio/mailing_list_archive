adding support for a new format is a small piece of coding (i.e.
compile time). somebody who knows what they are doing could get it
done in a couple of hours.

but ... you do not "set" the sample format. clients publish ports with
specified types.

the problem you face is that the backends only publish ports with the
current default (floating point) format. so you'd have to also modify
the relevant backend to use a different sample type. this is a bit
more work.

depends a lot on the CPU. on a standard, contemporary general purpose
processor, JACK is spending a miniscule amount of CPU on int<->float
conversions, even with an audio device with 26 inputs and 26 outputs.
converting to fixed point would likely save almost no CPU. of course,
you might be on CPU that only can do fixed point - that's another
story.
