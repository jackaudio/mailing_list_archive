Was hoping the experts would answer...
I saw the official explanation somewhere yesterday.

For now here's a thread with some info.
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.ardour.user/11471

Basically Jack-2 normally doesn't wait for clients now. But by using 
 the -S switch it can, just like Jack-1.
The drawback is that like Jack-1, there will be a 1-cycle latency. 
I think using -S makes Jack-2 behave almost exactly like Jack-1.
Hope that's right...

Forgot to mention: I was curious about that audio.conf security limits 
 file because the generic kernel did not install that file for me.
The -lowlatency kernel installed that file for me. 
But curiously, the first time installing the OS, it was called audio.conf.
Then after some botches, and tearing down and re-installing the OS,
 it was called audio.conf.disabled, and I had to change that. Strange.

Tim.
