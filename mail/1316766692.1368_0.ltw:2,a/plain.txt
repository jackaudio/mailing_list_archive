It's the other way around:

"The _default_ asynchronous mode has the drawback that the output is 
delayed by one period - because it "plays" the output buffer computed in 
the previous cycle instead of the one of the current cycle."

So when using the -S option with Jack2 you don't have an extra period of 
latency.

Best,

Jeremy
