I think you may have assumed that the word 'of' was a typo, but in
actual fact I believe the word 'take' is the typo and should be
replaced with 'make'. Steven wants to be incorporated into the list to
a greater degree! He wants to set up a windows server to mirror the
list but just wants all the emails to stop while he sets up :-P
