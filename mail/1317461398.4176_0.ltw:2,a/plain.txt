Subject:     [Jack-Devel] freewheeling callback

Hello all,

There seems to be no way (apart from getting the current thread's
attributes, somewhat clumsy) to detect freewheeling mode for a 
client that is started while Jack is in that mode. 

Suggested solution: when a client registers a freewheeling callback,
that callback is called when the client activates (as for the 
buffer size callback). 

Ciao,
