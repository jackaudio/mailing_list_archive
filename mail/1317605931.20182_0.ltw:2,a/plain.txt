I am not competent to remark on the rest of your post, but this claim
above is, to put it mildly, a bit strong. There have been projects
done with JACK and Internet2 that far exceed what any current
commercial entity could pull off (e.g. 24 channels of 96kHz floating
point audio, long haul across north america).

no doubt there are interesting "different" kinds of network audio that
remain to be done with JACK.
