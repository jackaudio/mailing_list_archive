Not necessarily (I believe). On the FPGA end I have every option (PLL, VCXO, etc.) to generate a "locked" word clock for the A/D or D/A converters from the incoming network packets. 
I think that for bigger networks (WAN, etc.) the timing might well be close to unsalvageable, but I expect very small LANs to be rather well-behaved.

OTOH my plan is to start as simple as possible, and when that works (more or less) to decide on further steps, like better word clock generator, or the ability to act as netjack master -- which I think requires more of the protocol to be handled in software (i.e. embedded CPU).
