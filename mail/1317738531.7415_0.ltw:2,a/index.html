&gt; Typically STL-IP is used with a dedicated hardware device that uses AAC codecs, has an Ethernet port, supports multicast, and has a routing table capable of failing over to alternate IP pathways. The transmission standard is open and Wikipedia has details on this at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_over_IP

I'm not sure that JACK would be the optimum point in the software stack in which to implement something like this as the introduction of bit-rate reduction in the data path will inherently increase latency, sometimes dramatically.


&gt; STL-IP devices are inherently expensive. The lowest cost installations I know of cost around $4,000 AUD for hardware. There is the potential for a developer implementing a software based solution to seek substantial funding from radio broadcasters.

The primary cost driver for these systems is the licensing of the relevant patents (Dolby Laboratories in the case of AAC).  This is not something that making the code "open source" will circumvent.  Low latency codecs that are also open source (such as CELT) are still in the early stages of development and not really ready for prime time at the moment.

Cheers!
