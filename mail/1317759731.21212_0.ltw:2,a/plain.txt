Please don't take this personally. I will _not_ open a ticket.
I do have a built-in aversion to anything that involves this
sort of tickets, to helpdesks and call centers that treat you
as a number, and to Sovjet style anonoymous bureaucracy.

If the Jack devs find that the proposal I made has any value,
and if they actually enjoy their activities and initiative
being controlled by a substitute software boss, they are free
to enter a ticket themselves. But it is not my job to do their
administration.

If anyone reports a bug or problem related to any of my
software he/she will have my personal attention and not be
redirected to a machine. It's a minimal form of courtesy,
nothing more.

Ciao,
