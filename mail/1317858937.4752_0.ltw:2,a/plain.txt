Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack Midi Events

Hi,

I'm currently putting together some documentation of the netjack1 
format, mostly for myself.
One question I have is about the jack midi api:

According to the documentation, the jack_midi_event_t contains a raw 
event buffer in normalized format, i.e. no running status or realtime 
messages "inside" of other messages.
 From that I would infer, that it is perfectly normal to store multiple 
midi events (e.g. "note-on"s) in one jack_midi_event_t (as long as they 
shall happen at the same sample time).

On the other hand I've seen at least one program that seems to assumes a 
one-in-one mapping (i.e. "assert(event.size<=3);" when not handling sysex).

Can anyone clarify this for me?

  Tobias
