So did you handle the reordering und defragmentation of the UDP packets 
in the FPGA hardware?
I would assume that a Soft-CPU is too slow for more than a few channels?
What period sizes (e.g. at 48k sample rate) did you use / are reasonably 
usable in your implementation?

I've first looked at netjack1([1]), as one of my computers currenty has 
only jack1installed. From a protocol perspective implementing Slave or 
Master is equally difficult (or simple).
