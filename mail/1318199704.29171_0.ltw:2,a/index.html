Hi Tobias,
Yes, fragmentation has to be handled in the FPGA. I didn't use a soft 
processor at all, everything was coded as state machines in the FPGA. I 
was only doing 2 channels, but there is no reason why it couldn't run 
considerably more than that.

&gt;&gt; I actually did this a while back. I used netjack2 implemented in an
&gt;&gt; FPGA. I used a wiznet ethernet chip to deal with the low level
&gt;&gt; protocol stuff, the only thing it doesn't do is DHCP, so I just used
&gt;&gt; static IP to make it easier. I did implement the master in the FPGA.
&gt;&gt; For details I just read the source code and figured out what parts of
&gt;&gt; it I wanted to implement.
&gt; So did you handle the reordering und defragmentation of the UDP packets
&gt; in the FPGA hardware?
&gt; I would assume that a Soft-CPU is too slow for more than a few channels?
&gt; What period sizes (e.g. at 48k sample rate) did you use / are reasonably
&gt; usable in your implementation?
&gt;&gt; If you are just building a simple one to one system you can leave out
&gt;&gt; a LOT of the jack stuff itself and just implement the netjack
&gt;&gt; protocol. One advantage of doing the master is that you can set the
&gt;&gt; sample rate to what you want and build a low jitter oscillator for
&gt;&gt; that frequency. Of course its best if that is the same frequency used
&gt;&gt; by whatever is the slave.
&gt; I've first looked at netjack1([1]), as one of my computers currenty has
&gt; only jack1installed. From a protocol perspective implementing Slave or
&gt; Master is equally difficult (or simple).
