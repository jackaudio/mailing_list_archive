Android uses ALSA, but has ALSA MIDI disabled in the kernel by default. 
  Also, Android has a gutted version of libc, and many POSIX features 
are missing.  (JACK1 is implemented on a POSIX assumption, JACK2 not so 
much.)

Another question to ask:  What would be the goal of porting JACK to 
Android?  Since JACK's original intent is inter-app communication... 
this work-flow isn't well-suited to most Android devices.

If the goal is low(er) latency... porting JACK may be more trouble than 
it's worth.  There are other alternatives... but a big show-stopper is 
that you will NOT be able to get RT scheduling on any production Android 
device.
