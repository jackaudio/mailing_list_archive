&gt; Hi John,

&gt; Is the VHDL (or Verilog or..) available under a libre license? It'd be
&gt; great to have an netjack core at http://opencores.org/ , would it not?
&gt;   
IMHO netjack is better called a "system" not just "core", as it requires 
a Ethernet interface (e.g via MAC core), which communicates over 
specific signals, may require hardware-specific initialization, etc. 
Further it needs some rudimentary Ethernet/IP handling (ARP, UDP) -- 
which opens up another can of possible implementation choices (e.g. 
UDP-offload, where only the audio data packets are handled in hardware 
and everything else is passed on to a soft-cpu, or maybe using some 
external IP-capable network chips [e.g. wiznet], etc.). Then for 
fragment reassembly you might want some RAM; at least for that some 
standards (wishbone, Avalon-MM master) are widely-used that enable the 
use of different memory cores (e.g. block-ram, SDRAM, ...). Finally the 
best input/output format of a "netjack-core" is not immediately clear: 
multiple I2S-lines would certainly make sense. OTOH some cores out there 
(SPDIF, ADAT, don't forget MIDI) might e.g. prefer a wishbone interface; 
still it would not make much sense to expose some internal (e.g.) 
SGDMA-interface to the outside for everyone to create his/her own 
input/output-adapter, with all the correct clocking.

Then your "netjack-core" needs some configuration interface (e.g. 
wishbone slave) for setting the ip address, sampling rate, channel 
configuration, master/slave mode, etc. YMMV.

So I think it would make more sense to opensource a few complete 
netjack-systems (together with the used IP-cores, e.g. ethernet, spdif, 
ram), including schematics of the dependent hardware. Then everyone who 
wants to build his own can start by replacing different parts of the 
reference design(s). Even more, when some generic infrastructure (say 
UDP-offload, MAC timestamping) is already there, support of other 
protocols like AVB is mainly a software thing (i.e. for the Soft-CPU).

But as (good) open-source VHDL/Verilog stuff is rare, I do think John 
contributing his netjack2 stuff would be great.
And for my netjack1 implementation, I did plan to put some code online. 
But don't expect it to be documented... or happen too soon. However I'll 
definitely announce it here.
