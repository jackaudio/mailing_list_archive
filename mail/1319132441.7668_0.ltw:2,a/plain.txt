Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Segmentation fault using jackctl_server_start

I have managed to narrow it down to the part where I set the server to be
real-time. I know that real-time mode is the default but I wonder why didn't
it work??
In the .cpp file:
line 221-222 is where I set the realtime status
set_parameter method is line 188
jackctl_get_parameter is a function I created, not one of  the control API
(line 95).

The testing main function :
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
  JackServerManager* jsm = new JackServerManager();
  jsm->start_server();
  sleep(30);
  jsm->stop_server();
  delete jsm;
}

The program crashes after trying to run jackctl_server_start on line 70.
When I remove lines 221-222 It works.

Thnx
