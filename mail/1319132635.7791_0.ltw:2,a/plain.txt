LAC 2012: the Linux Audio Conference - Call for Participation
April 12-15, 2012 @ CCRMA, Stanford University

http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2012/

[Apologies for cross-postings] [Please distribute]

Online submission of papers, music, installations and workshops is now 
open! On the website you will find up-to-date instructions, as well as 
important information about deadlines, travel, lodging, and so on. Read 
on for more details!

We invite submissions of papers addressing all areas of audio processing 
based on Linux and open source software. Papers can focus on technical, 
artistic or scientific issues and can target developers or users. We are 
also looking for music that has been produced or composed entirely or 
mostly using Linux and other Open Source music software.

The Deadline for all submissions is January 11th, 2012

The Linux Audio Conference (LAC) is an international conference that 
brings together musicians, sound artists, software developers and 
researchers, working with Linux as an open, stable, professional 
platform for audio and media research and music production. LAC includes 
paper sessions, workshops, and a diverse program of electronic music.

The upcoming 2012 conference will be hosted at CCRMA, Stanford 
University, on April 12-15. The Center for Computer Research in Music 
and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University is a multi-disciplinary 
facility where composers and researchers work together using 
computer-based technology both as an artistic medium and as a research 
tool. CCRMA has been using and developing Linux as an audio platform 
since 1997.

Stanford University is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, about one 
hour south of San Francisco, California. This is the first time LAC will 
take place in the United States.

Sincerely,

The LAC 2012 Organizing Team
