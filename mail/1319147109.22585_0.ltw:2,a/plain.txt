Subject:     [Jack-Devel] A kit of (commandline) standard-tools?

Hello everyone,

jack is great stuff, but i think it's missing a set of tools wich should be included in mainstream distributions, along with a fixed, minimalist but thorough set of options and features to enable easy use of jack from the commandline and embedded systems. ...i mean that 'unix'-way.
I thought about this when doing field-recording with arecord (alsa-tools standard commandline record tool) piped to the flac-commandline-encoder. I know of and i use jack_capture for this now, but i really think that tools like this should be included officially (so to say: $ apt-get install jack-tools). 
In my oppinion this would also include common tools like jack_connect or jack_lsp, but in contrast to the current versions with a somewhat more thorough set of options (along with 'lasting' switches and output) and better documentation, for using in scripts. This should also mean better parse(grep)-able output from iE jack_lsp (whose output is somewhat ugly to parse because of the multiple lines of output). The templated man-pages of jack_*-tools in my debianbox are not very helpful, either.

This is just a thought from my usage-mileage, i am not a real developer, though, but i'd like to help, if the issue is of any importance.

Thanks and best regards to everyone involved
