This paragraph makes no sense at all to me. I don't know how you use
jack, but most of the time, it's all via command line tools over here.

You are aware that you can start jackd without qjackctl, right?

And last but not least: if you want to change defaults for your
distribution, why do you talk to upstream? File bug reports against the
distribution instead.

I still fail to undestand your point. apt-get install jack-capture

Where's the difference?

Huu? jack_connect and jack_lsp are part of the jackd package. What's
wrong with that?

Go ahead and fix the manpage. You have the source, there is an issue
tracker. It's that easy.

The more you write the less I understand.

BTW: Have you noticed that there is bash-completion for jack? It parses
the jack_lsp output. One port per line, could it be easier?

As above, go and fix it.
