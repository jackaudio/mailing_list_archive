Yes me too, i think you missed the point.

It's not included in my debian repository (debian 5). Is it in 6? Then i'm sorry. But it's "third-party". Can i be sure my scripts work with it, let's say, a year from now?

I didnt say anything against it, did you read my mail entirely? 
It's lacking documentation, and i don't trust that commandline-"interface" to be consistent over time. that is all.
(this is what i trust about arecord, amixer, etc. my scripts for these tools are years old and still work.)

I was talking about scripting, not interactive shell. I was thinking about something like grepping (from one line) physical outputs and using the portnames for jack-connect. jack_lsp --properties gives 2 lines for a port. Whats your point with bash-completion here? anyway...

I know (and i think i made clear) that the issues mentioned are all possible to do right now (and so i am using it), but my concerns were about consistency, consistency to new versions of jack, to newer distributions, etc.

Ok, as i mentioned, i am no developer and not used in any processes involved in developing software, that mailing list was the only way to express that thoughts.
I still think this is an issue, but as you said, i'll fix it for myself. 
(hopefully not on every apt-get upgrade...)
