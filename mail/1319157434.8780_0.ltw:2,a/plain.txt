 Well...  I'm tried to select "ASIO (via portaudio)" in Pd. And then I
select "JackRouter 1". I think this indicate Pd compatibility with Jack...

>(with -X MME before the -d portaudio).  ("correct" as in "expected"...)

hum... I think I need to read more about jack! Where can I find informations
to solve that??

Other suggestions?
You will need to recompile pd? If yes, how?

Thanks a lot
          Esteban
