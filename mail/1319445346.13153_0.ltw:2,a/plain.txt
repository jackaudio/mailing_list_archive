You've got two problems.

(1) a bug in JACK2 1.9.7
(2) your audio interface is not running. If its a builtin Intel HDA
device (typical on most computers these days), then this probably
means that the capture source is not correctly set. Some HDA cards
refuse to run when this is the case. You should use alsamixer or any
of its graphical equivalents to play around with the capture settings
so that this message no longer appears as JACK starts up:

Note: this is just a guess based on the limited information available.
