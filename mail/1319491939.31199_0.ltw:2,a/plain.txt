"almost" is the key

jack_control can't reset parameters yet. ladiconf can. The simpliest way
to reset all parameters is to delete ~/.config/jack/conf.xml and
reactivate jackdbus. "jack_control exit" will tell jackdbus process to
quit. Next time jackdbus is [auto]activated, it will use
defaults. laditools control apps have "reactivate jack[dbus]" in their
context menu.

To reset parameter in ladiconf, double-click in the second column
("Status") and then press OK button.
