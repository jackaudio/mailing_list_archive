Are you using exactly same version of jackd and jackdbus? I've seen
another similar (xruns) report caused by using latest svn/git version of
jack2.

jackd and jackdbus use *exactly* same JACK server code
(libjackserver). With exactly same configuration, there is no known
reason for jackdbus to behave differently when compared to jackd.

You mention mplayer. It is not clear why you think mplayer relates.
