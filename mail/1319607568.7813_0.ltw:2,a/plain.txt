AFAIK this is bad idea in first place.

AFAIK you JACK cant use two devices directly.

Both jackd and jackdbus use same code for interaction with ALSA. Its
in libjackserver.so and the JACK driver for ALSA. If you see differences
in interaction with ALSA, then you've configured jackdbus differently
than jackd. Or you are using different version of JACK. Make sure to
reactivate jackdbus process after installing new version system wide.
