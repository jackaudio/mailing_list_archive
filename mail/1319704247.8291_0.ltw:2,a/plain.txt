Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [PATCH JACK1 & JACK2] drivers/alsa/memops.c: Error when source is non-native byte-order float

> 
> I stole drivers/alsa/memops.c from jack1 for a project I was working on.  In doing the unit testing, I found that the code fails when the source buffer is float with non-native byte order (i.e. the sample_move_d*_sSs() functions).  The attached patch (against Jack1 SVN) fixes that.  This also affects Jack2.

Hi Gabriel,

I recently committed your patch (adapted to JACK2) hoping it would solve the issue one guy had here with a pure float audio card, but:

1) it did not solve this specific issue

2) it seems that the patch breaks ALSA driver with some cards: see http://trac.jackaudio.org/ticket/243

Can you possibly check the patch I did at http://trac.jackaudio.org/changeset/4541 (maybe I did something wrong)

Otherwise I'll have to revert it...

Thanks
