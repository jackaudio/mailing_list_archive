Hmmm... I didn't expect anyone to apply this patch without first saying 
something along the lines of "Gabe... you're doing it wrong."  After 
all, memops.c is really old and heavily-used code.

Well, I presume the user has an x86 (LE) machine.  They're using a USB 
Fast Track Pro... and I would expect for it to be LE as well. 
Meanwhile, this patch was trying to fix cases where the byte order was 
OPPOSITE the native byte-order.

Does anyone know for sure what the byte order of a Fast Track is?
