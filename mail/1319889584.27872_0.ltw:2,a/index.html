&gt; Hello,

Hi!

&gt; My biggest problem on my setup is delay.

Can you quantify that?

&gt; I want to make a new  studio setting and want to know on what
&gt; point I can choose stuff to reduce the delay to almost zero.

"Almost zero" is still not specific enough.

Try to come up with "I'm aiming for 10ms roundtrip latency" or whatever
number you need.

Recording? Soft-Synths?

&gt; Will a better soundcard, other processor make much difference for example?

You first have to find the source of your current latency. Almost
everything can be the culprit, even something as simply as the wrong
period size.

If you can't make jackd operate smoothly at lower period sizes, then the
usual system tuning kicks in, that is, realtime priorities, realtime
kernel or maybe threadedirqs (Linux 2.6.39 and above), IRQ assignments
and their priorities...

For a start, it would help if you could name your soundcard. I'm not
exactly sure if jack-devel is the right mailing list for that, see
below.


&gt; Can some people help me out?

Also try asking the LAU (Linux Audio Users) mailing list.
