Can you quantify that?

"Almost zero" is still not specific enough.

Try to come up with "I'm aiming for 10ms roundtrip latency" or whatever
number you need.

Recording? Soft-Synths?

You first have to find the source of your current latency. Almost
everything can be the culprit, even something as simply as the wrong
period size.

If you can't make jackd operate smoothly at lower period sizes, then the
usual system tuning kicks in, that is, realtime priorities, realtime
kernel or maybe threadedirqs (Linux 2.6.39 and above), IRQ assignments
and their priorities...

For a start, it would help if you could name your soundcard. I'm not
exactly sure if jack-devel is the right mailing list for that, see
below.

Also try asking the LAU (Linux Audio Users) mailing list.
