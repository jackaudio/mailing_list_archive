Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jackd2 does not start with Terratec 6fire USB

Hello list,

Being newbie to this matter, I encounter the following on my "Debian
Testing" box:

2 cards available: AC97 (hw:0) and a USB Terratec Sixfire (hw:1). I can
use both cards using ALSA.

Starting jackd on -d hw:0 is ok, everything works fine AFAICS. I can
use qjackctl and play files.

OTOH: Starting jackd on hw:1 gives the following output:

$ /usr/bin/jackd -v -r -d alsa -d hw:1

Anyone a hint where to start looking for a solution? I've already
ddos'ed Google, but did not find any solution.
