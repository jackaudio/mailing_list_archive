&gt; 
&gt; this is pretty seriously braindead. that means that the overall buffer
&gt; in use is 36.75 periods long. every 37th period will be split across
&gt; the beginning and end of the buffer. ALSA can handle this kind of
&gt; nonsense, and thus JACK can too, except that its not going to ever ask
&gt; for an equivalent h/w configuration because it will never ask for a
&gt; buffer size that is anything other than the -n value multiplied by the
&gt; -p value, and both of them are integral.
&gt; 
&gt; its also fairly braindead in another way too: huge i/o latency (half a
&gt; second), yet with no actual decrease in CPU load since the device
&gt; keeps waking up the CPU every 600 samples. all the downsides of large
&gt; latency with none of the benefits ...
&gt; 
&gt; and in another way: 600 samples isn't a divisor of the USB transfer
&gt; frame size, which will cause additional issues with load etc.
&gt; 
&gt; you should definitely find somebody else who has used this with JACK
&gt; and/or talk to the author of the driver of this card (except that i
&gt; would have guessed that it was a generic USB class 1 audio driver ...
&gt; so ... ?)

So, I will forward your answer to the author of the driver. It's all
here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sixfireusb/

But OTOH: cpu load, that's another story, but could this issue be the
cause of jackd not starting?
