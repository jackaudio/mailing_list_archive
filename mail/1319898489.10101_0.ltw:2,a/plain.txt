i'm not sure what "this issue" is. JACK is designed to ask for h/w
configurations in the "sane, low-ish latency" end of things. it is not
going to ever try to replicate the settings that mplayer has ended up
(probably without much work on its part). its likely that the mplayer
settings are the result of constraints/information in the driver code.
if they actually reflect real limitation of the device - which i think
is unlikely - there's a fundamental problem with the device. more
likely, its a problem with the constraints/information provided by the
driver that cause it to reject the kind of h/w parameters that JACK
wants to use.
