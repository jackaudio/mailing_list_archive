JACK itself does not do any resampling, ever.

So you need to use a player that can. There are variety of players
with this capability. i believe that mplayer -ao jack can do this. All
gstreamer-based players (Rhythmbox, Totem and many others) can do
resampling (though they do it using a LOT of CPU power, alas.
