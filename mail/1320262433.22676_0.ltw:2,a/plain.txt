I have no idea what you are trying to say here.

If the function prototype was declared with weak linkage, and the
symbol is not found at runtime, then this condition:

     if (function_name)

will evaluate to false.

ardour is doing this all the time.

its fairly clear from your test program that you have not include
weakjack.h which is required to get weak linkage declarations.
