Hi Paul, I'm the original author of the mail that hermann forwarded.
Which part of my mail do you not understand? I thought I explained the
problem :-)

AFAICS jackweak.h defines JACK_OPTIONAL_WEAK_EXPORT and
JACK_OPTIONAL_WEAK_DEPRECATED_EXPORT, whereas the mentioned functions
from jack/session.h use JACK_WEAK_EXPORT, which is defined in
jack/weakmacros.h, which is included by session.h.

Anyhow, just to be sure I included weakjack.h in the test program,
but it doesn't change the behaviour.

Short summary:

If the jack function with weak attribute is in the shared lib that
is used when building the executable, an ELF PLT entry is generated.
When the executable is used with a shared lib that doesn't contain
the function, the the function address is still the PLT entry (!= 0)
but when called will indirectly jump to adress 0.

Btw. I'm using gcc 4.6.1, but I remember the same behaviour with older
gcc version.

ciao
Andreas
