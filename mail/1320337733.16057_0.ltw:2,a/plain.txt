Thanks for solving the problem (especially Nedko). Would be nice if it
could be documented more prominently, since fPIC (and also fPIE) produce
less efficient code and one would not normally use those options (and
if not used it fails silently). I didn't find any references to it, and
also not in code I looked at (e.g. building jackd tools or qtractor).

ciao
Andreas
