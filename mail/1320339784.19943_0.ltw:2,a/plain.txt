i think it may be a bug in gcc, actually. i did quite a lot of reading
on the issue, and it appears that ELF actually allows for two
different kinds of weak-ness, one of which is guaranteed to work in
the way it is described everywhere, and one which is more complex. i
will likely file a bug on this issue, because i agree that -fPIC
and/or -fPIE should not be necessary, but first i have to get some
guidance on where the bug would be (gcc or ld or ld.so)

i also tried testing on OS X but the test design i used won't work
there because of the way the OS X linker embeds explict paths into
library dependencies in mach-o files. however, i have tested with the
jack1/jack2 "switch" on that platform and found that weak linkage
works fine there even if the library is missing a symbol.
