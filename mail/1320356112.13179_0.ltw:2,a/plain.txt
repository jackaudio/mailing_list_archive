I agree 100% with that comment on its own merits and not in particular
w.r.t. to the portnames issue. It's just a big shame that the same
attitude wasn't taken in other cases. Such as for the Jack Session
patch. In that case, some completely ad-hoc extensions were accepted
instead of going for a generic non-RT message passing mechanism wich
could have been the base layer for a session management protocol based
on it. Two measures and weights ? Based on what ?
