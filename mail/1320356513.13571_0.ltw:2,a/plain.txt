Jack Session precisely uses the EXISTING generic, non-RT message
mechanism that has been in the JACK server from the beginning. Perhaps
you just want a DIFFERENT generic, non-RT message mechanism in the
server. There was no special hack to add it, other than some new
message types, which are going to have to exist at some level no
matter what mechanism is used.

the session manager uses the exact same message passing mechanism that
all other JACK clients use when they want the server to do something.
its not the world's greatest protocol, but its certainly nothing
specifically to do with jack session, or any other specific part of
the JACK API.

cf.

typedef enum  {
  BufferSizeChange,
  SampleRateChange,
  AttachPortSegment,
  PortConnected,
  PortDisconnected,
  GraphReordered,
  PortRegistered,
  PortUnregistered,
  XRun,
  StartFreewheel,
  StopFreewheel,
  ClientRegistered,
  ClientUnregistered,
  SaveSession,                <<<<<<<< JACK Session
  LatencyCallback
} JackEventType;

where is this "ad hoc extension" other than this new message type?
