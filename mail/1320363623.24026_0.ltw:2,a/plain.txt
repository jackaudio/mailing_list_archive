sletz: jack_port_set_name() is "broken" on jackd2.

 if (manager && ((refnum = manager->GetPort(myport)->GetRefNum()) > 0)) {
     JackClient* client = JackGlobals::fClientTable[refnum];
     assert(client);
     return client->PortRename(myport, name);

I only have a vague idea what fRefNum ist (an ID for the client?), so
the check for ">0" is a bit strong.

Later, client is NULL and the assertion fails.

Everything is fine on jackd1, I can rename system ports to whatever I
like as shown above.

The documentation doesn't limit jack_port_set_name() to the same client,
so I think a developer can expect it to work for all port_ids, no matter
if the port belongs to his own client or not.

Would be neat to have this on jackd2, too. ;)
