This is my first and last post in this thread and would probably not
even make it if it wasnt the fact that I'm asked on regular basis by
some users and developers about this issue.

Everybody has right to define JACK community in the way he sees fit.
IMO the stalinist approach of rejecting and denying other peoples ideas
without giving reasonable arguments only hurts JACK community in any
definition of it that preserves the meaning of community.

To make it clear: I don't belong to JACK "community" as defined by Paul
Davis.

I'm subscribed to this list just because Paul Davis insists that I must
be if I want to send [jackdbus] announcements to it.

This does not mean that I don't have interest in JACK technology. I
think my deeds so far prove it. As for the "fucked up from the
begining", my criticism was not against JACK technology in general but
about its API design. I've pointed to the problems I see in JACK API
design. For all of them I suggested solutions. Some of them are
implemented outside of the JACK C API.

This message is not indended to be offensive to anyone. If someone feels
offended by it, I apologise in advance.
