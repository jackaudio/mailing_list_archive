&gt; Everybody has right to define JACK community in the way he sees fit.

who the hell is talking about "the JACK community"? there's a
fractured group of individuals presiding over competing
implementations of both the core server+library and two different
network protocols, unable to reconcile their technical ideas, jeered
on from the sidelines by a very small crowd of largely uninvolved
people with new/different ideas on what JACK should do and how it
should do it, and increasingly ignored by distribution audio people
focused on desktop and mobile audio. some community.

&gt; IMO the stalinist approach of rejecting and denying other peoples ideas
&gt; without giving reasonable arguments only hurts JACK community in any
&gt; definition of it that preserves the meaning of community.

My goal in "running" JACK development has been change by
near-consensus, not change by stalinism. What you call "rejection of
ideas" actually translates to "somebody raised a reasonable objection
or issue with an idea and it was not countered in a way that struck me
as convincing or left quite a few other JACK developers feeling that
way".

Lets be clear: you don't like the fact that several different people
have raised objections to what you did with D-Bus integration into
JACK. You're not persuaded by these objections and you don't like that
I am one of those people. Despite my objections (and those of others,
including objections voiced when the control protocol was originally
discussed in Berlin), your work on D-Bus integration has actually been
deployed rather widely. Based on reports, it would appear to me that
roughly half of the people using JACK from a linux distribution is
using a version based on your work. So much for your "stalinist
rejection and denial".

&gt; To make it clear: I don't belong to JACK "community" as defined by Paul
&gt; Davis.

I don't define any JACK community, unless you mean "Paul Davis has
failed to apply my D-Bus patches to the jack1 svn codebase". Oh yeah,
*that* community.

&gt; I'm subscribed to this list just because Paul Davis insists that I must
&gt; be if I want to send [jackdbus] announcements to it.

Oh wow ... this is a mailing list like thousands, or millions, of
others that requires that you be a member of the list in order to send
email to it. I know, totally out of character for mailing lists .....
or perhaps you meant  "I don't actually want to read what other jack
developers and users have to say, I just want to be able to tell them
when my next release is out". Hard to tell how to choose between these
two possible meanings of "I'm subscribed to this list just because
..."

This is the level of logic that made me /ignore you on IRC.

     - technical objections to the way you integrated D-Bus that
nevertheless do not stop many distributions from packaging JACK with
your work, and
           didn't stop it from being a relatively integral part of
Jack2  =&gt; STALINISM

    - wants to post to a mailing list =&gt; the list moderator is a
dictator who INSISTS that i must be a member of the list to do so.
