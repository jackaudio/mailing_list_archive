&gt; &gt; in reality, there is no support on Linux for what is described in
&gt; &gt; the JACK header files. it just so happens that building with -fPIC
&gt; &gt; happens to work, but more as a side-effect than anything
&gt; &gt; intentional. __weak__ is designed as way to refer to symbols used
&gt; &gt; by one library but obtained from another, not symbols used by an
&gt; &gt; executable and obtained from a library. __weak_import__ on gcc-osx
&gt; &gt; does what we actually want.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; this is very confusing situation that will take some time to sort
&gt; &gt; out. -fPIC is a potential solution, and apparently has some
&gt; &gt; potential benefits because it allows the run time linker more
&gt; &gt; freedom to optimize memory layout. but i don't think that it should
&gt; &gt; be *the* solution. 

yes, it's unfortunate to require fPIC or fPIE, even if you need it
anyhow for shared libs and address randomization, it also has some
disadvantages. For guitarix we kept manual loading with dlsym since we
use libdl anyhow. But this is certainly not a good idea as a general
api.

Alternatives would be

 a) adding a function which returns a 32bit word with each bit
    reflecting the implementation status of one jack api function
 b) the same, but using a bit vector (not restricted to 32 entries)
 c) adding a functions which takes some sort of identifier (enum type)
    and returns the implementation status
 d) like above, but not return the status of single functions, but
    subsystems (like session_support_level_1, which means a certain
    set of functions must be implemented)

For distributions like debian I think its not such a big problem as
long as the distributed jack implementations keep in sync. The 2
functions for getting the uuid with different implementation status in
jackd1 and jackd2 are a problem, I don't know if there are more problem
areas. Of course one can always add -fPIE to any program not working
with all distributed jack version because of weak linking.

[...]
&gt; but I really don't understand why we didn't just add the functionality
&gt; to the lib. (like St&#xE9;phane has done it for jack2)

+1 to add jack_get_uuid_for_client_name to jackd1 (to keep in sync with
jackd2).
