i have nothing to add to this thread that is On Topic;

Off Topic, it saddens me to see such luminaries as Paul, Nedko,Fons and others talking to each other this way.  You have all been strong contributors and have made substantial progress towards what we enjoy on Linux today.

Linux Pro Audio has come a long way over the years through co-operative exchange,generous dedication and great vision.

Of late, there appears to be some dirt on the lens- time to just clean it off and move on.
