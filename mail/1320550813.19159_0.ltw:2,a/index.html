G'day

This email maybe long winded, but I figure better to give too much information rather than too little.
My intention is two-fold: to give an error report AND to request the GUID for the 64bit version of the JackRouter.dll, so I can manually create the Win7 Registry Key/Entry.

The journey to (and through) the Problem:

I've downloaded the 64bit installation package (for v1.9.8 on Windows 7) as per instructions obtained from the Mailing List:

From letz at grame.fr  Wed Oct 12 08:02:22 2011

Subject: [Jack-Devel] Jack in Windows 7 x64



Mixed 64/32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_64_setup.exe


and run the installation.
The 32 bit functionality is working according to spec.
However 64bit functionality was not available.
I then found an article which presented information for Registering JackRouter for 64-bit Windows:

[ http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jorgan/index.php?title=Configuring_Jack_PortAudio_to_connect_to_your_soundcard ]

Regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll"

My attempt to run the registration process resulted in the display of an error MessageBox:

(First dialog box)

MessageBox Title: JackRouter.
Message: Register Server failed ! (-1)

(click OK)

(Next Message box displayed)

MessageBox Title: RegSvr32
Message: The module "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll" was loaded but the call to DllRegisterServer failed with error code 0xffffffff.  For more information about this problem, searchonline using the error code as a search item.

I then referenced a Microsoft Knowledge Base article (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/249873 ) which contained the following non-specific information:

________________________________
The module ""%1"" was loaded but the call to %2 failed with error code %3.\n\nFor more information about this problem, search online using the error code as a search term.

There was an error when regsvr32.exe invoked the entrypoint in the module specified in the command line. The error code appears as part of the message
________________________________

Brickwall.

I then perused the available source code for v1.9.7.
I managed to locate the GUID for the JackRouter.dll from the source code.
By referencing the Windows Registry entries under:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\ASIO\JackRouter (registry entry name located in the ASIO SDK from Steinberg)

I was able to confirm the validity of the GUID in the source code (it was exactly the same as appeared in the Registry Key).

I believe that if we have two distinct executables containing COM servers, each DLL must register a unique GUID for each.
I assume that the GUID located in the v1.9.7 code must be for 32bit, and a macro must be used in the v1.9.8 code to switch between the 32bit/64bit GUID depending on the version (32/64 bit) being compiled.

Possible Solutions:


1)      There is an issue with my Computer Setup which needs to be addressed.
I am running:

a.      Win7 Pro SP1 64  bit

b.      HP EliteBook 8540w

c.      Intel Core i7 CPU Q840 @ 1.87 GHz

d.      16Gb RAM

I also have ASIO4ALL v2 installed and functioning.



2)      There is an issue with v1.9.8 JackRouter.dll registration code which needs to be addressed (though I doubt it).  No suggestions here as I don't have access to the source code.


3)      Someone sends me the GUID (or the source code) for the v1.9.8 JackRouter.dll, and I just enter it direct into the Registry Key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ASIO\JackRouter

Hope I'm not being too presumptuous.
