In-Reply-To: Guy Perrin [Jack-Devel] Win7 Jack v1.9.8 - failure to register 64bit JackRouter.dll from v1.9.8 (1320550813.19159_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: Win7 Jack v1.9.8 - failure to register 64bit JackRouter.dll from v1.9.8

Hi Guy,

I'm a humble Jack user on windows a couple of years now and indeed Stephane fullfilled my wishes for a 64bit version and beyond that he  did a mixed one !

My system is win7 home premium, 64bit, Intel T4400 dual core at 2.2GHz 4GBram, standard HDD at 5.900rpm

I really had no problem registering the 64 bit .dll with command prompt.

I have my UAC shut down. I presume you did so. It is a must on win7.

At first when I tried to register 64bit JackRouter.dll from system 32 (regsvr) I got errors too.

The solution was to run the command prompt and type 
Regsvr32 “C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll”

Then all went OK 
- I presume that indeed in your C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8 there is a folder named 64bits and inside there is the JackRouter.dll

This is a quick responce from a fellow win7 user untill Stephane or other more experienced people respond :-)

Best
Panos

PS. Glad you came and visited our jOrgan wiki ! :-D

Θεμα: [Jack-Devel] Win7 Jack v1.9.8 - failure to register 64bit JackRouter.dll from v1.9.8


G’day
 
This email maybe long winded, but I figure better to give too much information rather than too little.
My intention is two-fold: to give an error report AND to request the GUID for the 64bit version of the JackRouter.dll, so I can manually create the Win7 Registry Key/Entry.
 
The journey to (and through) the Problem:
 
I’ve downloaded the 64bit installation package (for v1.9.8 on Windows 7) as per instructions obtained from the Mailing List:
 
From letz at grame.fr  Wed Oct 12 08:02:22 2011
Subject: [Jack-Devel] Jack in Windows 7 x64
 
Mixed 64/32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_64_setup.exe
 
and run the installation.
The 32 bit functionality is working according to spec.
However 64bit functionality was not available.
I then found an article which presented information for Registering JackRouter for 64-bit Windows:
 
[ http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jorgan/index.php?title=Configuring_Jack_PortAudio_to_connect_to_your_soundcard ]
 
Regsvr32 “C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll”
 
My attempt to run the registration process resulted in the display of an error MessageBox:
 
(First dialog box)
 
MessageBox Title: JackRouter.
Message: Register Server failed ! (-1)
 
(click OK)
 
(Next Message box displayed)
 
MessageBox Title: RegSvr32
Message: The module “C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll” was loaded but the call to DllRegisterServer failed with error code 0xffffffff.  For more information about this problem, searchonline using the error code as a search item.
 
I then referenced a Microsoft Knowledge Base article (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/249873 ) which contained the following non-specific information:
 

________________________________

The module ""%1"" was loaded but the call to %2 failed with error code %3.\n\nFor more information about this problem, search online using the error code as a search term.

There was an error when regsvr32.exe invoked the entrypoint in the module specified in the command line. The error code appears as part of the message

I then perused the available source code for v1.9.7.
I managed to locate the GUID for the JackRouter.dll from the source code.
By referencing the Windows Registry entries under:
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\ASIO\JackRouter (registry entry name located in the ASIO SDK from Steinberg)
 
I was able to confirm the validity of the GUID in the source code (it was exactly the same as appeared in the Registry Key).
 
I believe that if we have two distinct executables containing COM servers, each DLL must register a unique GUID for each.
I assume that the GUID located in the v1.9.7 code must be for 32bit, and a macro must be used in the v1.9.8 code to switch between the 32bit/64bit GUID depending on the version (32/64 bit) being compiled.
 
Possible Solutions:
 
1)      There is an issue with my Computer Setup which needs to be addressed.
I am running:
a.      Win7 Pro SP1 64  bit
b.      HP EliteBook 8540w
c.      Intel Core i7 CPU Q840 @ 1.87 GHz
d.      16Gb RAM
I also have ASIO4ALL v2 installed and functioning.
 
2)      There is an issue with v1.9.8 JackRouter.dll registration code which needs to be addressed (though I doubt it).  No suggestions here as I don’t have access to the source code.


3)      Someone sends me the GUID (or the source code) for the v1.9.8 JackRouter.dll, and I just enter it direct into the Registry Key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ASIO\JackRouter
 
Hope I’m not being too presumptuous.
 
Regardz
Guy
