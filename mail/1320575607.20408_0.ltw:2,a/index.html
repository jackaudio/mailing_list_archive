"perhaps"? The missed opportunity for JACK not becoming the mainstream
default audio interface for linux apps in general is a terrible waste.
Pulse has now sidelined JACK and for those that say it's not meant for
consumer use, well, you get what you wish for... fewer developers,
paypal contributions and eyeballs for testing.

The one, perhaps only, serious advantage the "linux desktop" might have
had over winmac systems is that it could have had a professional class
audio system available to all users by default. I'm confounded by what
could have been if all the effort put into Pulse had gone into JACK
instead.
