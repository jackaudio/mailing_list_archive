&gt; &gt; I don't like resampling, especially when there is no need to. If I
&gt; &gt; need to restart or send a signal to jackd I don't win very much
&gt; &gt; using jack (is that right?), contrary to the use of a native 44100
&gt; &gt; mpd and a VLC (or any other program) that talks 48000 directly to
&gt; &gt; the soundcard.
&gt; 
&gt; For a "music consumer" type application, then indeed: you don't win
&gt; very much using jack.  This includes flash players, media players,
&gt; and media servers.  Instead of JACK you might consider using
&gt; PulseAudio, ALSA plugins (e.g. dmix), or ROAR audio.

It's a standalone box without monitor. But I agree with you about using
jack or not. But jackd has the nice and easy possibility to connect
inputs to outputs. I have no idea if this is possible using ALSA
directly. The driver of my audiocard does not support yet the S/PDIF
input, but I finally like to be able to connect the S/PDIF input to an
output. And with Jack, this is no problem.

BTW and OT: does anyone know how to connect an input to an output using
ALSA?

&gt; For a "music creator" type application, JACK is pretty friggin'
&gt; awesome. This includes sequencers, synths, DJ, and multi-track
&gt; recording applications..

I just want to play music, that's all :)

&gt; &gt; And this is the scenario here:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - soundcard Terratec Sixfire USB
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - a bunch of flac files at 44100
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - A dreambox through S/PDIF (not implemented in the driver yet) or
&gt; &gt; through a webstream at 48000
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the end I'd prefer to use the S/PDIF instead of the http stream.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds more like a consumer-type application.  It's possible to
&gt; use JACK in this type of use-case -- but you'll find yourself pissing
&gt; in the wind a lot (and not able to get help on it).[1]  It's your
&gt; call.

I fear you're right...

&gt; [1] Examples:
&gt;      * If application can't follow real time rules... it gets
&gt;        disconnected and must be restarted.  This is unforgivable
&gt;        for consumer use cases.  This is a bug in the application
&gt;        in the creator use cases.

I found this on the net:

http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge

AFAIUI this could be a nice solution to that issue. AFAIUI then.

&gt;      * Client/server is pretty much a PITA in any use-case.
&gt;        For creator use cases it's tolerated.  For consumer
&gt;        use cases it results in streams of profanity.
&gt;      * The overhead of a real-time set-up is a PITA, but totally
&gt;        necc. in a creator use-case.  For the consumer use case,
&gt;        getting a real-time setup is overkill and a great way
&gt;        to lock up your system because of shoddy "consumer"
&gt;        applications.

I have always used the -r option when jackd was started. But indeed, I
have to reconsider the use of jackd, although I like the simple setup
of it.
