It's a standalone box without monitor. But I agree with you about using
jack or not. But jackd has the nice and easy possibility to connect
inputs to outputs. I have no idea if this is possible using ALSA
directly. The driver of my audiocard does not support yet the S/PDIF
input, but I finally like to be able to connect the S/PDIF input to an
output. And with Jack, this is no problem.

BTW and OT: does anyone know how to connect an input to an output using
ALSA?

I just want to play music, that's all :)

I fear you're right...

I found this on the net:

http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge

AFAIUI this could be a nice solution to that issue. AFAIUI then.

I have always used the -r option when jackd was started. But indeed, I
have to reconsider the use of jackd, although I like the simple setup
of it.
