It's one way, but there are some drawbacks.  Another way is to use
libasound_module_pcm_jack.so (iow, "type jack" in your
.asoundrc/asound.conf) to couple ALSA interfaces directly into a JACK
server.  This also has some drawbacks, but the two methods are
different enough to warrant understanding both possiblities and
choosing whatever is best for your particular situation.
