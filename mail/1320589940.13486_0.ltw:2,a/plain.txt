It would seem a lot of people think this is a big issue (the nvidia
rt-kernel patch), and it sort of is, but the real problem is that the
patch can't be distributed as it violates the GPL. - not that it is
difficult to patch. In reality (as you probably know) all that is
required is modifying a couple of symbols in the sources, but
obviously one needs to be okay with compiling kernels. it can be done
manually, in a minute or two, or quite easily with the proper sed
command. When the issue 1st cropped up on the rt-list;

I would love to post the sed command's but i would assume that is
pretty much distributing the patch? (so i probably shouldn't do that,
LOL). it's not to hard to find though, i've seen it around the web.
it's literally 3 sed commands and you're done ;)

you should just be able to take your current .config and only change a
couple of things. there was just a tutorial in the linux-rt-user-list
about this a few days ago. Most users shouldn't need to muddle through
disabling/enabling things. it's really just a bash command (for
migrating your current config) and then changing 2 or 3 things in the
kernel .config . i'd post a link, but apparently i deleted it from my
email. oops! (it should be archived somewhere, i'll have a look, if
you like).
