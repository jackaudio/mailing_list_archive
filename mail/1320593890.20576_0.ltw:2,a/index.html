&gt;&gt; It would seem a lot of people think this is a big issue (the nvidia
&gt;&gt; rt-kernel patch), and it sort of is, but the real problem is that the
&gt;&gt; patch can't be distributed as it violates the GPL.
&gt;
&gt; So we can have a situation in which providing the source code
&gt; (or equivalent - patch, sed command,...) would violate the GPL
&gt; and not providing it would not violate the GPL ?

Yup. As far as i understand it, you are more than welcome to patch it
yourself, but actually distributing the patch or kernels compiled with
it, is another story.

&gt; I'm by no means an expert on these things, but it *does*
&gt; seem odd.

I'm no expert either, but i've read about this, here and there...and
Yes, i totally agree -&gt; it is very odd, in some sense.

But the reality is that the minute you enable 'Full-Preemption' in the
kernel, you have introduced a few *GPL only* bits of code (in the
kernel), which are incompatible with the Nvidia proprietary driver
(this may be true of the ATI Catalyst driver too, although i am not
sure). note: this only happens with 'full-preemption'... if the kernel
isn't patched - it will simply fail to build... it's annoying, but
it's either Nvidia opens up the driver (as people suggested on the
RT-list - but that's not likely to happen), or you fix it yourself.

For me, personally - it's not a big deal. (I've compiled rt-3.0+ many
times already, using the nvidia patching) but i can see how for linux
newbie's who own nvidia cards, it's not really a very good situation,
at all.
