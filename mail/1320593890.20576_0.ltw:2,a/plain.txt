Yup. As far as i understand it, you are more than welcome to patch it
yourself, but actually distributing the patch or kernels compiled with
it, is another story.

I'm no expert either, but i've read about this, here and there...and
Yes, i totally agree -> it is very odd, in some sense.

But the reality is that the minute you enable 'Full-Preemption' in the
kernel, you have introduced a few *GPL only* bits of code (in the
kernel), which are incompatible with the Nvidia proprietary driver
(this may be true of the ATI Catalyst driver too, although i am not
sure). note: this only happens with 'full-preemption'... if the kernel
isn't patched - it will simply fail to build... it's annoying, but
it's either Nvidia opens up the driver (as people suggested on the
RT-list - but that's not likely to happen), or you fix it yourself.

For me, personally - it's not a big deal. (I've compiled rt-3.0+ many
times already, using the nvidia patching) but i can see how for linux
newbie's who own nvidia cards, it's not really a very good situation,
at all.
