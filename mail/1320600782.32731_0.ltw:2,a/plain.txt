My guess is that the situation is this (which I've run into before with 
some broadcom wireless drivers):

   * People start with the distro's .config, which enables some
     GPL-only features (e.g. lockdep).

   * After they patch their kernel, it will typically not
     compile because of a mix between GPL-only and non-GPL
     features.

   * If it does compile, when the module is loaded at
     runtime then several things in the kernel get UN-loaded
     as soon as the kernel taint is detected.  Sometimes this
     cripples the kernel.

   * Since most folks don't understand the above, the easy
     route is to modify the module so that it will lie to
     the kernel and say, "Uh, yeah... I'm GPL. Really. :-)"
     But the legality of distributing a lying bastard patch
     is unknown... and dubious at least.

   * The proper fix is to remove the GPL-only components
     from your kernel if you wish to use non-GPL components.
