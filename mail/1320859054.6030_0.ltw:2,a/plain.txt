Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack and MIDI troubles.

Hello!
I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L31a) and Jack version 0.88 (April 15, 2011),
the Activate MIDI box is checked, I start the server but I can't see the
system_midi in the connections window as shown in the manual. Is there
anything I might do to fix this problem?

Thanks very much and sorry for taking your time.

All the best,
