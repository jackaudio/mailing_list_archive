Subject:     [Jack-Devel] automated jack settings test

i had an idea for an application to help new users setup jack and i
wanted some feedback.

the general thought is...
1. a user would start the application
2. pick an available audio interface to test
3. the program would test settings [1] against an "xrun condition" [2]
4. then determine the best setting by lowest stable recorded latency
5. set the lowest stable setting

[1] this could be brute force or following smart rules
[2] not defined at this time and i'm sure everyone will argue what is
proper but could be something arbitrary like 4 xruns over a 10 second
time period or 0 xruns over 15 minutes, also this could even
incorporate the 'rtevel' application or other test to invoke a load

okay, let me know why this wouldn't work.
