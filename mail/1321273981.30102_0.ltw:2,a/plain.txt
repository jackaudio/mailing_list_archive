Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Compiling QjackCtl 0.3.8 on Windows XP

Never tried to install Qjackctl on Windows but I did try to install Qt on
Windows once, and I remember that I had to install MinGW/Cygwin for C/C++
environment. I guess that VS can work too. Are you sure everything
installed OK? Can you compile other C/C++ programs?
