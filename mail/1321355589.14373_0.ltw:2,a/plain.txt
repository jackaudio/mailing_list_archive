Every version of JACK I've tried since I put the system together at the
end of 2005. It hasn't affected the sound of my recordings so further
investigation hasn't been a priority.

Currently I'm using jack1 version 0.118.0. The last version of jack2 I
tried was a long time ago, somewhere around svn 148.

I'm in the middle of setting up a new system with current JACK versions,
but it won't be finished for a couple of weeks. I'll report back to the
list when I've got it running.
