Follow-Up:   Gabriel Rios Re: [Jack-Devel] Compiling QjackCtl 0.3.8 on Windows XP (1321516098.32275_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Compiling QjackCtl 0.3.8 on Windows XP

I checked again and corrected the placeholders with its respective windows
path. Now, new issues appeared:

..\src\qjackctl.cpp:97: error: 'CONFIG_PREFIX' was not declared in this
scope

Also, in the same qjackctl.cpp file some syntax errors appeared but I
corrected them. I also tried with:

#include "config.h"

in the top of qjackctl.cpp file and nothing happens, the same error occurs.
I also bypassed the line with the problem and the same "'XX' was not
declared in this scope" error type appears with other variables such as
PACKAGE_VERSION in qjackctlPatchbayFile.cpp.

Can anybody give me give me a clue for this?

Thanks in advanced. I'll really apreciated :D
