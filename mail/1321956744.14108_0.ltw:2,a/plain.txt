Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Running Jack with protools 9 (OS X)

Dear all,

I have been trying to get Jack and protools 9 to run together under
OSX. I can select JackRouter as my audio device in PT. When PT is on
pause it seems to communicate with Jack - e.g. if I place a signal
generator plug-in on a track it produces audio via Jack. However, as
soon as I press play the transport automatically stops. But no errors
are produced, and neither PT nor jack complain.

Any pointers would be very welcome.

Many Thanks

Peiman
