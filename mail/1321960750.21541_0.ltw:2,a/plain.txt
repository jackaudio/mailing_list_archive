Subject:     [Jack-Devel] How do I replicate the -P parameter when using dbus

Hi,

My hardware setup requires the -P command line option to successfully 
start a jack server. This works fine when set in qjackctrl (Audio mode: 
Playback) as long as the dbus option is not selected. However when the 
dbus option is selected the server hangs on startup. Looking at the 
qjackctl code and the contents of conf.xml shows that when Playback mode 
is selected the only affect on the conf.xml parameters is that duplex is 
set to false, this is exactly the same when the Capture mode is selected 
so there is no differentiation between Playback and Capture modes in the 
parameters. This looks like a qjackctl bug, but putting that to one side 
for the moment as well as presumption that my server hangs because it is 
not getting clock/data from one of the digital capture ports.

I have experimented to see what should be set in the dbus parameters to 
replicate the -P option. Using jack_control I have tried various 
combinations of settings for the duplex, playback, capture, inchannels 
and outchannels parameters, but I have not found one combination that 
successfully starts the server.

My question is, is the replication of the -P parameter possible using 
the dbus server, and if so what is the magic combination?

Thanks

Roger
