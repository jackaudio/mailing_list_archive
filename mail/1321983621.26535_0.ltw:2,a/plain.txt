What is the full jackd commandline that works for you?

Are you using the JACK driver for ALSA, right? If so, the driver
parameter name that matches the jackd`s '-P' is 'playback'. Make sure
that 'device' parameter is not set. Note that jack_control has no
command for resetting parameters to their defaults, only for setting
them. ladiconf can do this though. If you want to reset all parameters,
delete the conf.xml file and reactivate jackdbus.

jackdbus (and control api) parameters are ordered and the alsa driver
puts the device parameter after the capture and playback parameters. So
if you set the device parameter, it will override the playback
parameter. Quick look into jackd (jack2) code suggests that jackd has
the same behaviour. so specifying both -P and -d (regardless of the
order) will cause -P to be ignored.

Here is the relevant code of the alsa driver:

            case 'C':
                capture = TRUE;
                if (strcmp (param->value.str, "none") != 0) {
                    capture_pcm_name = strdup (param->value.str);
                    jack_log("capture device %s", capture_pcm_name);
                }
                break;

            case 'P':
                playback = TRUE;
                if (strcmp (param->value.str, "none") != 0) {
                    playback_pcm_name = strdup (param->value.str);
                    jack_log("playback device %s", playback_pcm_name);
                }
                break;

            case 'D':
                playback = TRUE;
                capture = TRUE;
                break;

            case 'd':
                playback_pcm_name = strdup (param->value.str);
                capture_pcm_name = strdup (param->value.str);
                jack_log("playback device %s", playback_pcm_name);
                jack_log("capture device %s", capture_pcm_name);
                break;


The the internal order of these parameters is:
 * "capture", 'C'
 * "playback", 'P'
 * "device", 'd'
 * "duplex", 'D'
