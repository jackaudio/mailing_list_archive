this is a common problem. it typically (not always) means that have
not set the capture source (in the h/w mixer) correctly. the device
refuses to start in duplex mode when this is the case. ALSA drivers
get this wrong, probably through lack of information but it could also
be a straight bug. use alsamixer or something equivalent to select a
valid capture source.
