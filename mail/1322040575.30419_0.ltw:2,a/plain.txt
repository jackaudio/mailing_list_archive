Subject:     [Jack-Devel] configuration

hello everyone

first of all, i am portuguese, and my english is not the best.... i hope 
you understand me.
i'm not shure if this is the right place, if not please give me a link 
to put my questions.

i have a little home studio, but no money to buy all the hardware a 
need. i use an 8 tracks Maxi studio isis ( with 12 years old ) for audio 
recording, but i have to work with windows millenium , because it don't 
work on other systems. basically the machine is an amd athalon xp 2000, 
on a via main board with 512 Mb of ram, and two hdd, one for the os, the 
other for the recordings. The software is Nuendo 1.5.2 , the latest that 
works on millenium. this machine is only for recording sessions. isis 
have an asio 2 driver.

all the other tasks are made on another machine, a 3gb core 2 duo, on 
asus p5q deluxe, with 4gb of ram, an audigy 2 zs, 1 hdd for os, and 2 
more in a raid system for workyng.

my principal question is; is it possible with JACK put the 8 inputs of 
isis in the second machine, and record them on that machine? and 
simultaniosly record the 2 audigy tracks? (total of 10 recording tracks 
at the same time ).

i really apreciate if someone can tell me something, and if possible, 
some kind of guide to do this, or a link where this is already explained.

Many thanks to all

gonzaga
