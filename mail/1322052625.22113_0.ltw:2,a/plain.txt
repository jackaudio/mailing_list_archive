Some final words on replicating the -P behaviour. The absolute minimum 
config that I could get to work was as follows:

<driver name="alsa">
<option name="capture">0</option>
<option name="duplex">false</option>
</driver>

All the other driver parameters can be left to default their "unset" 
values. Note that setting the capture parameter to its unset default 
value of "none" (i.e. str:set:none:none) does not work, it must show in 
dp as str:set:none:0.

Paul, I suspected that the capture source settings must be the problem 
and I played with alsamixer to try to fix it. I could not find a 
combination of settings that fixed it.

The card is an nVidia onboard HDA chipset

00:07.0 Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP72XE/MCP72P/MCP78U/MCP78S 
High Definition Audio (rev a1)

I have tried front and rear mic capture sources and the switches on the 
two capture volume controls off and on. No joy.
