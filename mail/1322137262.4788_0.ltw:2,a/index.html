&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess if I want to use qjackctl I will have to go back to figuring 
&gt;&gt;&gt; why the
&gt;&gt;&gt; server hangs when capture ports are specified on my system that has a
&gt;&gt;&gt; standard onboard nVidia HDA chipset. But that is for another day.
&gt;&gt; this is a common problem. it typically (not always) means that have
&gt;&gt; not set the capture source (in the h/w mixer) correctly. the device
&gt;&gt; refuses to start in duplex mode when this is the case. ALSA drivers
&gt;&gt; get this wrong, probably through lack of information but it could also
&gt;&gt; be a straight bug. use alsamixer or something equivalent to select a
&gt;&gt; valid capture source.
&gt; Some final words on replicating the -P behaviour. The absolute minimum 
&gt; config that I could get to work was as follows:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;driver name="alsa"&gt;
&gt; &lt;option name="capture"&gt;0&lt;/option&gt;
&gt; &lt;option name="duplex"&gt;false&lt;/option&gt;
&gt; &lt;/driver&gt;
&gt;
&gt; All the other driver parameters can be left to default their "unset" 
&gt; values. Note that setting the capture parameter to its unset default 
&gt; value of "none" (i.e. str:set:none:none) does not work, it must show 
&gt; in dp as str:set:none:0.
&gt;
&gt; Paul, I suspected that the capture source settings must be the problem 
&gt; and I played with alsamixer to try to fix it. I could not find a 
&gt; combination of settings that fixed it.
&gt;
&gt; The card is an nVidia onboard HDA chipset
&gt;
&gt; 00:07.0 Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP72XE/MCP72P/MCP78U/MCP78S 
&gt; High Definition Audio (rev a1)
&gt;
&gt; I have tried front and rear mic capture sources and the switches on 
&gt; the two capture volume controls off and on. No joy.
&gt;
&gt;
PROBLEM SOLVED.

Final final words I hope.

Please ignore what I said before about setting capture to zero. That was 
working because zero is an invalid alsa name which is ignored by the 
real alsa driver, and because the driver IGNORES the value of the duplex 
parameter and always sets its internal capture and playback parameters 
to TRUE if the parameter is present (set).

So here is the full story of the jack alsa drivers handling of the 
capture (-C), playback (-P), device(-d), and duplex (-D) parameters.

The following internal values are used to initialise the real alsa 
interface. Before the parameters are read they are initialised as follows.

capture FALSE
capture_pcm_name "hw:0"
playback FALSE
playback_pcm_name "hw:0"

The parameters are processed in the order they are encountered as follows.
, de
capture(-C) - set capture TRUE and if the value associated with the 
parameter is not "none" set capture_pcm_name to that value.

playback(-P) - set playback TRUE and if the value associated with the 
parameter is not "none" set playback_pcm_name to that value.

device(-d) - set capture_pcm_name and playback_pcm_name to the value 
associated with the parameter.

duplex(-D) - set capture TRUE and playback TRUE. Any value associated 
with the parameter is ignored.

Once all parameter processing has finished if both capture and playback 
are FALSE then set them both to TRUE.

The dbus version of jack enforces the parameter order capture, playback, 
device, duplex. I am not sure what the command line jackd does.In any 
case it is important to ensure that configuration does not specify a 
duplex parameter if you want only capture ports or only playback ports. 
So my new minimal playback only config for dbus is

&lt;driver name="alsa"&gt;
&lt;option name="playback"&gt;hw:0&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/driver&gt;

A thing that caught me out once or twice in these tests is that 
jack_control cannot remove parameters so if you end up with  duplex 
parameter "set" then it will stay that way until the jackdbus process is 
stopped and.config/jack/conf.xml is removed. Setting the duplex 
parameter value to FALSE has no affect as the driver only checks if the 
parameter is set and ignores its value.

Going back to to my original reason for starting this thread it appears 
that qjackctl is somewhat broken in this respect.

My apologies if this duplicates information that is readily available 
elsewhere, I could not find any!
