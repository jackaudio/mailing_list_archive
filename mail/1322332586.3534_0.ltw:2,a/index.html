Hello everyone.
First of all, i'm sorry for writing my questions in a developers list. I
searched but didn't find a users list in the internet. Please provide some
details on one if it's not OK to ask user Q's here.

Second, Jack rocks my world :) seriously i don't think there is a windows
application that does half of what jack can do.
- i have 'revived' the crapy sound of my laptop speaker (using jack and
jack-rack and the alsa loopback device)
- i have used a windows XP machine as a jack-client where I used FL studio
to add more effects and play them back through the laptop (where jack
server resides). Just did that as a proof of concept. I can't recall
exactly how I did that though at the time (i think i installed jack and
netjack1 and used as audio driver in jackd configuration the netjack
module? i am not sure)

I tell you all that cause i need to go one step further now and I have some
questions about it.
I have a hoontech st-audio dsp24 audio card (running on the ice1712 chip i
think i read in some yahoo group
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/STAudio/message/1860 ). Accompanying the
card I have the dsp2000 port, which provides 8ins/8outs and 1 midi IN / 2
midi OUT .

Hoontech doesn't exist anymore and there is no driver for windows 7 64bit
pc. There is however  support for this chip through alsa and people seem to
use it
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=278907
http://www.pcmus.com/linux-driver.html

what I want to do, is install the card on a linux machine and export all
the audio channels (preferably midi too) in my LAN so as to access them
from a windows 7 pc, where i will be running jack-server (or some version
of netjack or jack-trip) .. there i will run jack-aware applications in
order to use the multi-channel features of my card. So basically I want to
use the client (win7) as an audio source... can i?

Well I have read that it can be done just please verify it too :) Other
than that:

-does jackd /netjack have any problem under windows7 64bit? f.e. with
permissions or otherwise?
-will I be able to have realtime audio? i know that jack doesn't add
latencies, but if I connect a midi keyboard in the soundacard, which
exports midi signals to the win7 client and the client generates audio that
travels back to the jackserver, should i expect a small enough latency?
-how should I go about the network part? the jackserver connected to alsa
is the only sure part on the linux box. on win7 should install jack server
and netjack? or netjack2? or jack-trip?

If someone has done it (either has used the specific sound card or has
connect multi-audio channels over LAN, please please please make contact, i
will probably need your expertise in the near future!

Thank you very much for your time and interest
Thanassis Silis
