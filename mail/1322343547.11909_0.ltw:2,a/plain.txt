Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack server hang when Duplex or Capture selected - SOLVED

Hi,

I am posting this for information. I have a system with an Asus M4N78 
motherboard installed into a simple case with an analog (AC97) front 
panel audio module (i.e. two stereo jack sockets and a blanked off HDMI 
socket. I have struggling for a week now to find out why I could not get 
a jack server to start if it tried to access any capture hardware via 
the ALSA driver. I tweaked all the relevant settings I could find in 
alsamixer etc. but could not find a combination that worked.

I finally had a look at the motherboard manual and noticed that there 
was a Bios setting that configured the motherboard front panel audio 
header for either AC97 or HD Audio. It was set to HD Audio. I presume 
this was the default as I had never touched it. I set it to AC97 and 
Jack burst into life in full Duplex mode! I assume this was because the 
digital HD Audio interface was blocking due to lack of clock or 
something. So I you cannot get Jack to work on capture this is worth 
checking.

I expect there will be similar settings on other motherboards. I 
apologise for the waste of bandwidth if this has been reported before, 
but maybe this post will save someone else a few days of scratching 
their head :-)

Roger
