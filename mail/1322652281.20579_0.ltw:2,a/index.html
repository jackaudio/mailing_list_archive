Hi St&#xE9;phane,

Thanks for the fast response!

&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm just updating the JNAJack bindings to fix a few issues, mainly on
&gt;&gt; Windows. &#xA0;As part of that I'm switching to mapping jack_free
&gt;&gt; throughout. &#xA0;Can someone let me know what are the earliest versions of
&gt;&gt; Jack1 and Jack2 that provide that function? &#xA0;I can't seem to find this
&gt;&gt; information - apologies if I'm missing somewhere obvious.
&gt;
&gt; Version 1.9.3 for jack2, don't know for jack1

Great, thanks.


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've fixed a couple of issues in the mapping of jack_connect, mainly
&gt;&gt; by switching the mapping to require a client passed in as per the
&gt;&gt; underlying API. &#xA0;Out of interest, why does this function require a
&gt;&gt; client? &#xA0;It's not in the documentation as far as I can see, but I'd be
&gt;&gt; keen to document more than "it's required because it is!" ;-)
&gt;
&gt; Because jack_connect is a call that "goes to the server to be done there" (thus requite a client)
&gt;

OK.  The reason I asked is because JNAJack is a fairly
straightforward, but OOP, mapping of the Jack API.  Almost all
functions that require a client are mapped to methods on a client
object.  This is one of a small set of functions that don't map neatly
that way because you're not restricted to the ports from the client
you pass in.


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And finally, any chance of getting JNAJack added to the Programming
&gt;&gt; Libraries section of the Applications page? &#xA0;JJack hasn't had any
&gt;&gt; development action for a long time, while JNAJack is active and works
&gt;&gt; in more places - a number of projects using JJack are or have
&gt;&gt; expressed interest in switching.
&gt;
&gt; Can you provide a short description ?
&gt;

Sure.  Based on the current description of JJack.


JNAJack (http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/) - An alternative
Java bridge API for JACK. Provides a more direct mapping of JACK
functions, and supports all platforms that JACK runs on.


Hope that suits.

Thanks and best wishes,

Neil
