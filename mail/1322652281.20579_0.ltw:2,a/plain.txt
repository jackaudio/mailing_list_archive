Hi Stéphane,

Thanks for the fast response!

Great, thanks.

OK.  The reason I asked is because JNAJack is a fairly
straightforward, but OOP, mapping of the Jack API.  Almost all
functions that require a client are mapped to methods on a client
object.  This is one of a small set of functions that don't map neatly
that way because you're not restricted to the ports from the client
you pass in.

Sure.  Based on the current description of JJack.


JNAJack (http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/) - An alternative
Java bridge API for JACK. Provides a more direct mapping of JACK
functions, and supports all platforms that JACK runs on.


Hope that suits.

Thanks and best wishes,

Neil
