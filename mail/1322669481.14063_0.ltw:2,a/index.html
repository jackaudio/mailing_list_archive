Hi Paul,

Thanks for your email.

&gt;&gt; OK. &#xA0;The reason I asked is because JNAJack is a fairly
&gt;&gt; straightforward, but OOP, mapping of the Jack API. &#xA0;Almost all
&gt;&gt; functions that require a client are mapped to methods on a client
&gt;&gt; object. &#xA0;This is one of a small set of functions that don't map neatly
&gt;&gt; that way because you're not restricted to the ports from the client
&gt;&gt; you pass in.
&gt;
&gt; the only apps that would be affected that potential restriction are
&gt; those that want to offer generic connection utilities.
&gt;
&gt; if you're not such an app, you don't need to care about the
&gt; possibility to use ports from other clients. if you ARE such an app,
&gt; you will be glad to have the possibility in place. if you want JNAJack
&gt; clients to be unable to play that role, feel free to impose the
&gt; restriction. otherwise, your API needs to take this into account, and
&gt; creating two different kinds of clients seems like overkill to me.

The idea is not to impose restrictions - that was my main reason for
writing JNAJack and not working with JJack in the first place.

If you see the docs for the two classes

Jack - http://java-audio-utils.googlecode.com/hg/javadoc/jnajack/org/jaudiolibs/jnajack/Jack.html
JackClient - http://java-audio-utils.googlecode.com/hg/javadoc/jnajack/org/jaudiolibs/jnajack/JackClient.html

you'll notice that the bulk of the JACK functions that take a client
pointer are now methods on JackClient.  However, the wrapper to
jack_connect is within the main Jack class, and that's where I intend
on keeping it.  As you'll see, the current release doesn't require a
client to be passed in - JNAJack uses its own hidden client.  This was
causing problems and a load of extra code in making sure the hidden
client was always valid, and so I've deprecated this approach, and
moved to requiring a JackClient object be passed in.  This is far
better for the user of the API to manage, and fits better within the
aim of a transparent (if OOP) mapping of JACK.

I just want to document why that parameter is required.  Initially
(and possibly naively) it seemed superfluous.  Taking a stab in the
dark at answering my own question, can I assume it's there because
it's possible to have multiple servers running and the lib needs to
know which server to ask to connect ports on?

btw - don't suppose you've got a Jack1 version number for jack_free support?

Thanks and best wishes,

Neil
