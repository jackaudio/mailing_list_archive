have you ever seen a server/client API that did not use such a data
structure? the jack_client_t contains information required to
communicate with the client. we don't want to open a new connection to
the server every time a request is made.

i do ... 0.118.3 ... but this just highlights (again) another major
issue with JACK right now - the absence of a defined soname that
identifies the API rather than the version or implementation. it would
be best if you could avoid version number testing if at all possible -
this has already caused issues in some other JACK clients.
