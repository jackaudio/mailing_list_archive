&gt;&gt; I just want to document why that parameter is required. &#xA0;Initially
&gt;&gt; (and possibly naively) it seemed superfluous. &#xA0;Taking a stab in the
&gt;&gt; dark at answering my own question, can I assume it's there because
&gt;&gt; it's possible to have multiple servers running and the lib needs to
&gt;&gt; know which server to ask to connect ports on?
&gt;
&gt; have you ever seen a server/client API that did not use such a data
&gt; structure? the jack_client_t contains information required to
&gt; communicate with the client. we don't want to open a new connection to
&gt; the server every time a request is made.
&gt;

Ah, OK.  I think I was naively expecting the lib had it's own
communication channel with the server.

&gt;&gt; btw - don't suppose you've got a Jack1 version number for jack_free support?
&gt;
&gt; i do ... 0.118.3 ... but this just highlights (again) another major
&gt; issue with JACK right now - the absence of a defined soname that
&gt; identifies the API rather than the version or implementation. it would
&gt; be best if you could avoid version number testing if at all possible -
&gt; this has already caused issues in some other JACK clients.

I was just going to specify that the new version of JNAJack will not
work with versions of JACK below that - the mapping will immediately
fail because it can't find jack_free.  The workaround if needed would
be to use the existing version of JNAJack, which I'll keep available.
Of course, I may need to look at a more robust way of mapping
'optional' functions as JNAJack develops!

Thanks,

Neil
