Ah, OK.  I think I was naively expecting the lib had it's own
communication channel with the server.

I was just going to specify that the new version of JNAJack will not
work with versions of JACK below that - the mapping will immediately
fail because it can't find jack_free.  The workaround if needed would
be to use the existing version of JNAJack, which I'll keep available.
Of course, I may need to look at a more robust way of mapping
'optional' functions as JNAJack develops!

Thanks,

Neil
