Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] The Situation(s) With JACK

I am glad to read this email.

I have felt that JACK seems to have diffused the scope of the project
by having multiple versions and different implementations.  Or perhaps
the gestation of the various version/implementations has diffused the
scope.  Either way, I believe JACK can be more effective and more
widely embraced by re-evaluating the goals, scope, and audience of the
project.

This re-evaluation might even mean removing "features" that do not
serve the scope of core project.  And perhaps the removed
functionalities could reintroduced as plugins, add-ons, or even
_other_ projects.

From a user and distribution perspective (with especial interests in
new users) I would like to see JACK more focused simplifying user's
experience.  Users will not ultimately care about how powerful or
functional JACK is if the threshold to usage is too high.
