From a JACK driver perspective, it certainly makes things difficult.
For a few months now, I've been tempted to port the 'alsarawmidi'
slave driver to JACK 1, and each time I start, I think about
maintaining two sets of code that do the same thing in two different
languages with two different driver APIs, become frustrated, and find
something better to do with my time.

This applies to the driver problem too.

This too.

Back in July, you said this:

LV2 looks better to me all the time.  I had reservations about LV2
because of the lack of transport sync, but the new 'time' extension:

    http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/time/

... seems like an elegant solution to the transport problem.

I'd personally like to see momentum shift to LV2.

I'll go out on a rather shaky looking limb and say that I'd like to
see JACK become a library that is used to route audio and MIDI data
'inside' an application (e.g. between plugins), and continues to
provide bindings to hardware.
