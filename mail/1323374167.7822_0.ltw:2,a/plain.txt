Dear Paul,

about a year ago I decided to start making music again - and decided to use 
Linux.
I must admit - I had a hard time to get my setup working - although I'm a 
devloper and so I don't hesitate when it comes to debugging.
A lot of problems results from being unsure which jack/mp/dbus works/works 
best with ffado and later how to get lash/ladish running.

It took me nearly a year but now I can say that it's stable. But I agree that 
anyone without a technical background woukd have given up long before.

As a result: I REALLY APPRECIATE your serious attempt here! 
The combination of jack, random audio application and something that keeps all 
together (ladish) is unique (afaik) and great! (If we only could have this 
flexible routing inside an audio application as well...)

I will be glad to help wherever I can!

Hoilger
