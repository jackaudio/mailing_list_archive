Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: The Situation(s) With JACK

Hi everyone,
Please accept a word from a humble windows user of Jack, basicaly a very simple setup here to "merge" audio from any of my vast array of virtual instruments and effects :-)

I'm reading every post on this list for almost two years now, though not on Linux and trying to learn as much as I can.

Agree with Paul that many times things go complicted for the simple Jack user and agree as Hermann and others said that a one sole project would be great and as simpler as posssible of course.
Things went messy at some point as I can judge from the e-mails sent, so I agree with Paul's descriptions and reasons :-)

Lookin' forward for the proposal too.

Best to all
Panos

Yep, really hope that all jack(s) could be merged back into one main
