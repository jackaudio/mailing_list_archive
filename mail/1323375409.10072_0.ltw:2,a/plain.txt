I need to stress that at this point in time I'm not terribly
interested in trying to solve the problems that JACK encounters that
are inherently hard (for example, exploring the n-dimensional
configuration space of your audio interface to find good settings to
use by default).

My concern is over the problems we have created through the
development process (or lack thereof).

Thanks for reminding me about FFADO. Another problem.
