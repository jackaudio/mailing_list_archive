Hear hear!

I'm a long time (mostly) lurker on this list.

My role at AudioScience includes maintaining the ALSA driver for our
soundcards.

As it happens, one of my current tasks is to "make it work better with
JACK".  This has higher priority than "make it work better with
pulseaudio, etc", because we see JACK as the key enabler for pro-audio
apps on Linux, and hope it continues to be so.

I look forward to your proposals, without underestimating how hard it
may be actually make changes.
