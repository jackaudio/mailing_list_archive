Hi,

&gt; It has come time to address the situation with JACK.

Good news is this!

&gt; This widely-used and innovative project has stalled out and is causing
&gt; as many headaches for users (potential and actual) as it is helping.
&gt; Lets take an honest and harsh look at the problems:
&gt;
&gt; 1. there are at least 3 different implementations of JACK. This is not
&gt; a problem in and of itself, but in the real world, it contributes the
&gt; remaining problems in real ways.

Non-technical issue. Lot of people (including myself) will benefit from
solving this one. I cannot judge whether it is possible to really fix
this problem. For sure the situation can be improved by growing
friendlier social environment.

&gt; 2. there is no defined API version that clients can be said to depend
&gt; on (that is, libjack from different implementations of JACK do not
&gt; come with a standard soname that can be used in dependency
&gt; determination). In addition, JACK's attempted use of weak linkage to
&gt; deal with an evolving API turns out to be based on a serious
&gt; misconception on Linux (it does work on OS X, and sometimes on Linux
&gt; too).

I've said this before and I'll say it again. IMO the API versioning
should be "split" based on features. Unfortunately libjack has no
library initialization function. jack_client_open() could be used for
this, by defining new jack_options_t bits. Given the multiclient uses
of jack though, it makes much more sense to introduce jack_init()
instead.

I'm talking about something like LV2 extension mechanism here.

IMO dereferencing a function pointer on each libjack API function call
will not introduce significant overhead.

&gt; 3. there is widespread confusion about the relationship between Jack1
&gt; and Jack2, with an overwhelming number of people believing that Jack2
&gt; is the newer, better version of Jack1.

I agree that renaming jackmp to jack2 was idealistic attempt to unite
the jack development. Optimistic one as well.

&gt; 4. JACK was one of the first audio APIs to provide network streaming,
&gt; but the existence of two incompatible implementations of netjack makes
&gt; network streaming more to difficult to explain than it is to actually
&gt; do. Both implementations have their benefits, but there is absolutely
&gt; no talk of any unification and some notable resistance to it. When the
&gt; typical question arises "Can I use JACK to stream audio from A to B?"
&gt; the answer is so complex that many people just give up (and probably
&gt; rightly so). Contrast this to, for example, using the AUNetSend and
&gt; AUNetReceive plugins on OS X. It just makes a mockery of netjack in
&gt; terms of ease of use (though latency is terrible).

I'd speculate that this is same issue as (1)

&gt; 5. after seven or eight years, the API still has not reach version 1.0.0

It will help if jack1 versioning is split from the jack API
"versioning". This implies requirement for wider consensus on the
API itself. Hopefully you are ready for this.

&gt; 6. largely as a result of (2), distributions and applications are
&gt; starting to create a situation where despite the fact that Jack1 and
&gt; Jack2 are, in fact API and ABI compatible, explicit requirements for
&gt; Jack1 or Jack2 are in effect. They are wrong to do so, but their
&gt; reasons for doing so are entirely understandable.

I think that upstream should actively cooperate with packagers by giving
advice and writting guidlines. My attempt on is probably still in the
trac wiki.

&gt; 7. any new extensions to the JACK API (such as an upcoming metadata
&gt; proposal from David Robillard and myself) require duplicated effort
&gt; across different implementations, which is silly and not very
&gt; productive.

LV2-like extension mechanism can be linked to a plugin system. This
includes unified interface for drivers. I never got good reasoning why
driver API was not unified. I proposed this at some point and my
proposal was rejected.

&gt; 8. Dangling features such as interactions with multiple devices have
&gt; totally different implementations in Jack1 and Jack2, with notable
&gt; drawbacks in each case. Where Tschak solves them, it does so having
&gt; effectively dying as an unreleased private project.

It will help to get consensus what is the proper way of doing it and to
do it in all implementations. Given that there are no non-technical
issues here.

&gt; 9. Despite the presence of JACK Session support in a number of notable
&gt; applications, many developers apparently feel that it is unfinished or
&gt; incomplete or in some other way not worth using "at present"

I don't see this as problem. The problem is that nobody actually has
motivation to work on solving the issues.

&gt; 10. The existence of LADISH continues to produce confusion for users
&gt; wondering how best to do some of the things that LADISH does, because
&gt; there are now other ways of doing them.

You could explain how to do these things without ladish I guess. Its not
clear to me either. For various reasons in ladish I implemented things
that belong to JACK. But as we all know, the world is not perfect.

&gt; 11. Interaction with PulseAudio continues to be a nightmarish headache
&gt; for a large number of new JACK users.

We need someone with interest in both JACK and PulseAudio to fix this
mess. I doubt we will find volunteer for this. Maybe if some day one of
the mainstream distributions supported by commercial companies will pay
someone to fix this mess. A friendlier community is something that will
help again.

&gt; 12. By adopting jackdbus, distributions have sanctioned a way of using
&gt; of D-Bus that was explicitly disavowed at LAC Berlin. This also isn't
&gt; a problem in and of itself, but it has created a situation where
&gt; (almost) all interaction between JACK and everything else that is
&gt; accessible via D-Bus is the responsibility of Nedko, with whom I now
&gt; have a severely antagonistic relationship and several other people
&gt; have a ... difficult ... relationship. I take as much blame for the
&gt; relationship part as anyone else, but it remains the case that JACK
&gt; interacting with other parts of Linux via D-Bus is a good idea that is
&gt; currently limited by the entire constellation of issues surrounding
&gt; jackdbus. Torben has already demonstrated an alternative
&gt; implementation (jack.py) that follows the guidelines set up at LAC
&gt; Berlin, but it remains a small, experimental project barely used by
&gt; anyone.

It will help to clearly state what exacly was *disavowed*. After all
these years it is not clear to me what is wrong, in your (Paul) opinion
with jackdbus. The explainations changed several times so far. And then
the jack1 upstream acted against their claims. So I'm lost and
demotivated. Clear messages and technical level criticizms are needed
here. This applies to "the entire constellation of issues surrounding
jackdbus" statement too. I think i have a good telescope but it doesnt
translate other people thoughts into written text.

&gt; 13. The only people to do work on JACK development over the last
&gt; couple of years confine themselves to specific versions of JACK, and
&gt; despite nominally friendly communication, do not really collaborate
&gt; with the others. (Note that I am including myself in this).

Lack of friendly environment. Dictatorship instead of adoption or
rejection with sane explainations. I'm not talking only about jackdbus
here. There is a significant stack of jack1 (and sometimes jack2 too)
upstream decisions that doesn't make sense to lot of users and
developers/contributors.

14. multiclient apps. jack client (autore)naming.

&gt; In summary, although Jack1 and Jack2 continue to provide useful
&gt; functionality to users and the overall design of the API continues to
&gt; have many fans and a relative elegance, the *project* as a whole is in
&gt; a serious condition.
&gt;
&gt; I blame myself for some important parts of this situation. When
&gt; Stephane originally wrote jackdmp as an experiment with
&gt; multi-core/parallel support and other important ideas, it was decided
&gt; by the JACK group meeting at LAC Berlin that jackdmp would become the
&gt; successor to jack1. Instead what happened was that Jack1 and Jack2
&gt; have continued to evolve in parallel, largely because the primary
&gt; maintainers/developers of Jack1 (Torben and myself), while respectful
&gt; of the ideas that Stephane designed in jackmp, find the actual
&gt; implementation to be something we don't wish to work with. At no time
&gt; have I, as the supposedly benign dictator of the project, put my foot
&gt; down and said "this has to stop", because it seems wildly
&gt; inappropriate. Stephane (and others) are totally free to continue
&gt; their work, and distros are totally free to pick whichever
&gt; implementation they wish. Nedko has continue to work on Jackdbus and
&gt; LADISH, and has seen his work widely adopted by many distributions.
&gt; Torben has been free to do a completely new implementation ("tschak")
&gt; which merges jack1 and jack2 features/design. I can't stop that, and
&gt; I'm not sure I want to - these efforts have been incredibly valuable
&gt; as research projects and providing useful functionality.

jackdbus/ladish was never inteded as experiment. It was and still is
project with clear goals. Everything would have been much easier for
everyone if my efforts were criticized with reason and not faced with
negative emotions.

&gt; But ... this freedom has come at quite a high cost for the user
&gt; (particularly the potential user) community, as detailed above. For
&gt; developers, its not so bad - the different implementations are, in
&gt; fact, API and ABI compatible, and the issues with netjack are
&gt; invisible to clients. The dithering around with
&gt; LASH/LADISH/JackSession and the core design issues that they represent
&gt; should have been solved years ago and weren't, which does impact
&gt; developers a bit, but for most its a "use it/don't use it" choice that
&gt; doesn't really affect them, only those users who want to use one of
&gt; LADISH/JackSession for some purpose.
&gt;
&gt; A few weeks ago, I had an extremely negative IRC interaction with the
&gt; maintainer of the JACK plugin for audacious. Some of what this person
&gt; said was based on ignorance and incomplete understanding, but at the
&gt; root of his complaints and observations were a few perfectly valid
&gt; criticisms of JACK as a project (rather than as a technology) And so
&gt; now ....
&gt;
&gt;                                     It Has To Stop.
&gt;
&gt; I do have a proposal for how this is going to stop, but before I put
&gt; it forward, I would like to first see if there are any other ideas
&gt; floating around on the mailing list that have not come up when I've
&gt; discussed this situation on IRC. Once any discussion about this email
&gt; settles down, I'll outline my proposal (whatever it ends up being at
&gt; that point).
&gt;
&gt; This is a decision that affects users, packagers, distributions,
&gt; developers and other people. Despite a radically innovative (and,
&gt; thanks to Stephane, cross-platform) design and unmatched
&gt; functionality, the project needs a change in direction in order to
&gt; live up to its potential. If it can live up to it, then JACK will be
&gt; the simple, natural, functional choice for audio and MIDI on all 3
&gt; major OS platforms including network streaming, and the confusion and
&gt; stagnated development that it embodies now will be a thing of the
&gt; past. If it can't, JACK will continue to be a useful tool, but will
&gt; likely slowly rot. Lets try to avoid that if we can.

I'm waiting for your proposal too. And I hope that it will improve the
unfortunate situation in the Linux Audio community. Make it a friendlier
place where people who disagree can cooperate. Where people when faced
with oposition try to adjust their views and try to create a product
that can serve a wider community. If we want this to happen, instead of
reducing scope and trying to control everything we should seek the path
to cooperation. To not burn bridges but to build them.

The rebel armies need home too, just like guardians need their temple.
