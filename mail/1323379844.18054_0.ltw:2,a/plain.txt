Non-technical issue. Lot of people (including myself) will benefit from
solving this one. I cannot judge whether it is possible to really fix
this problem. For sure the situation can be improved by growing
friendlier social environment.

I've said this before and I'll say it again. IMO the API versioning
should be "split" based on features. Unfortunately libjack has no
library initialization function. jack_client_open() could be used for
this, by defining new jack_options_t bits. Given the multiclient uses
of jack though, it makes much more sense to introduce jack_init()
instead.

I'm talking about something like LV2 extension mechanism here.

IMO dereferencing a function pointer on each libjack API function call
will not introduce significant overhead.

I agree that renaming jackmp to jack2 was idealistic attempt to unite
the jack development. Optimistic one as well.

I'd speculate that this is same issue as (1)

It will help if jack1 versioning is split from the jack API
"versioning". This implies requirement for wider consensus on the
API itself. Hopefully you are ready for this.

I think that upstream should actively cooperate with packagers by giving
advice and writting guidlines. My attempt on is probably still in the
trac wiki.

LV2-like extension mechanism can be linked to a plugin system. This
includes unified interface for drivers. I never got good reasoning why
driver API was not unified. I proposed this at some point and my
proposal was rejected.

It will help to get consensus what is the proper way of doing it and to
do it in all implementations. Given that there are no non-technical
issues here.

I don't see this as problem. The problem is that nobody actually has
motivation to work on solving the issues.

You could explain how to do these things without ladish I guess. Its not
clear to me either. For various reasons in ladish I implemented things
that belong to JACK. But as we all know, the world is not perfect.

We need someone with interest in both JACK and PulseAudio to fix this
mess. I doubt we will find volunteer for this. Maybe if some day one of
the mainstream distributions supported by commercial companies will pay
someone to fix this mess. A friendlier community is something that will
help again.

It will help to clearly state what exacly was *disavowed*. After all
these years it is not clear to me what is wrong, in your (Paul) opinion
with jackdbus. The explainations changed several times so far. And then
the jack1 upstream acted against their claims. So I'm lost and
demotivated. Clear messages and technical level criticizms are needed
here. This applies to "the entire constellation of issues surrounding
jackdbus" statement too. I think i have a good telescope but it doesnt
translate other people thoughts into written text.

Lack of friendly environment. Dictatorship instead of adoption or
rejection with sane explainations. I'm not talking only about jackdbus
here. There is a significant stack of jack1 (and sometimes jack2 too)
upstream decisions that doesn't make sense to lot of users and
developers/contributors.

14. multiclient apps. jack client (autore)naming.

jackdbus/ladish was never inteded as experiment. It was and still is
project with clear goals. Everything would have been much easier for
everyone if my efforts were criticized with reason and not faced with
negative emotions.

I'm waiting for your proposal too. And I hope that it will improve the
unfortunate situation in the Linux Audio community. Make it a friendlier
place where people who disagree can cooperate. Where people when faced
with oposition try to adjust their views and try to create a product
that can serve a wider community. If we want this to happen, instead of
reducing scope and trying to control everything we should seek the path
to cooperation. To not burn bridges but to build them.

The rebel armies need home too, just like guardians need their temple.
