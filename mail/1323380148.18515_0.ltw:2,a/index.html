Having used all 3 jacks (jack1/2/tschack and jack-dbus = 4?) I can 
attest that there are subtle differences in  performance and setup, so 
it's certainly true that there are some substantial complications in 
userland that have  plagued jack- however despite these drawbacks let's 
not lose sight of jacks' remarkable power, stability, flexibility and 
functionality. i doubt there is anything that can come close to it.


To me, it seems there is nothing really wrong with jack, it's more that 
issues aren't being attended to when they arise. There are 4 'main' 
developers, all of whom have firm views on direction and implementation- 
hence the "forks" - and when a user makes 
reports/observations/suggestions the dev "responsible" for "your" jack 
is likely to respond but no one else will... therefore bugs and issues  
simply aren't being dealt with.

Now that Torben Hohn has ceased to develop (at least for the time being) 
tschack no longer is a player- it's not even available anymore, so the 
remaining dev's really have to sort out what they do agree on first, and 
move from there. This is more a 'people' problem in the short term 
rather than a technical one imho.

good to see this is at least out in the open ;)
