I second those concerns about better SMP system support, but note that multiple JACK clients per process (which is perfectly possible with jack2) already allows to do (or at least to "test" even if the model is not perfect) what you are speaking about.

But I think we should clearly separate which could be a "fresh look"..., to the current situation Paul wants to address, only that we are still all waiting.... of the "how" ((-;
