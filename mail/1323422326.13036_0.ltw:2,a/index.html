&gt; &gt; One good reason to have a fresh look at what Jack is
&gt; &gt; supposed to do is the fact that SMP systems are more
&gt; &gt; or less the norm today. And complex apps (A3 being
&gt; &gt; the prime example) are taking advantage of that and
&gt; &gt; organising their internal processing using multiple
&gt; &gt; threads. No doubt more will follow. Yet, scheduling
&gt; &gt; in Jack remains on a per-process basis. That means
&gt; &gt; that e.g. if app B depends on input from app A, the
&gt; &gt; entire B is made to wait until all of A has done its
&gt; &gt; work, while the actual dependencies may be much more
&gt; &gt; fine-grained. There are several ways to address this.
&gt; &gt; One would be to have a single 'audio engine' process
&gt; &gt; and delegate all audio processing to it. That would
&gt; &gt; of course mean that all security is lost, a single
&gt; &gt; rogue audio routine could bring down everything. 
&gt; &gt; Another solution would be to make Jack trigger port
&gt; &gt; or groups of ports instead of a process. So anything
&gt; &gt; in B that depends on A would run as soon as all output
&gt; &gt; from A that a part of B depends on is available. In
&gt; &gt; other words, the signal graphs becomes global. That
&gt; &gt; would also allow B to be a insert of A without adding
&gt; &gt; latency etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But I'm dreaming. 
 
&gt; I second those concerns about better SMP system support,
&gt; but note that multiple JACK clients per process (which
&gt; is perfectly possible with jack2) already allows to do
&gt; (or at least to "test" even if the model is not perfect)
&gt; what you are speaking about.

Yes, but only if the dependencies are more or less static,
which is usually not the case. If they are not, you would
not only need to migrate modules from one client to another 
(possible), but also ports (hairy).

They way apps like A3 schedule their internal multithreaded
computation is entirely dynamic. A module is added to a
queue when all its inputs are available; sooner or later
one of the computation threads will take it there, execute
it and provide triggers for the next ones. There is no
static schedule, simply because without knowing the exact
execution time of each module you can't compute one.

If you want to seamlessly integrate such networks then
the same thing should happen between processes. So, when
a Jack client has computed the signal on a particular
output port it should set that port to 'ready', Jack
transfers this status to all ports this one is connected
to, and the owners of those destinations decide what to
do. In theory. In practice part of that dynamic logic
will have to be pushed into Jack somehow to avoid useless
process switches. How to do that is the main challenge.

On a related topic: it seems that OSX now has a system
that allows a userland process to schedule a task to be
executed at a defined priority by a global 'engine', and
in a way that is much more efficient than creating a thread
for it. The way I understand it (which may be wrong) is that
it uses a pool of system threads instead. Do you know more
about this ? 

&gt; But I think we should clearly separate which could be
&gt; a "fresh look"..., to the current situation Paul wants
&gt; to address,

I agree. I bring this up because 'a fresh start' is one
of the options, even if unlikely the one to be adopted.

&gt; only that we are still all waiting.... of the "how" ((-;

Indeed :-(
