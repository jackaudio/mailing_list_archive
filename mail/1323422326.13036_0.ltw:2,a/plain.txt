Yes, but only if the dependencies are more or less static,
which is usually not the case. If they are not, you would
not only need to migrate modules from one client to another 
(possible), but also ports (hairy).

They way apps like A3 schedule their internal multithreaded
computation is entirely dynamic. A module is added to a
queue when all its inputs are available; sooner or later
one of the computation threads will take it there, execute
it and provide triggers for the next ones. There is no
static schedule, simply because without knowing the exact
execution time of each module you can't compute one.

If you want to seamlessly integrate such networks then
the same thing should happen between processes. So, when
a Jack client has computed the signal on a particular
output port it should set that port to 'ready', Jack
transfers this status to all ports this one is connected
to, and the owners of those destinations decide what to
do. In theory. In practice part of that dynamic logic
will have to be pushed into Jack somehow to avoid useless
process switches. How to do that is the main challenge.

On a related topic: it seems that OSX now has a system
that allows a userland process to schedule a task to be
executed at a defined priority by a global 'engine', and
in a way that is much more efficient than creating a thread
for it. The way I understand it (which may be wrong) is that
it uses a pool of system threads instead. Do you know more
about this ?

I agree. I bring this up because 'a fresh start' is one
of the options, even if unlikely the one to be adopted.

Indeed :-(
