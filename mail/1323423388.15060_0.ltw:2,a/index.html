&gt;&gt;&gt; One good reason to have a fresh look at what Jack is
&gt;&gt;&gt; supposed to do is the fact that SMP systems are more
&gt;&gt;&gt; or less the norm today. And complex apps (A3 being
&gt;&gt;&gt; the prime example) are taking advantage of that and
&gt;&gt;&gt; organising their internal processing using multiple
&gt;&gt;&gt; threads. No doubt more will follow. Yet, scheduling
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Jack remains on a per-process basis. That means
&gt;&gt;&gt; that e.g. if app B depends on input from app A, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; entire B is made to wait until all of A has done its
&gt;&gt;&gt; work, while the actual dependencies may be much more
&gt;&gt;&gt; fine-grained. There are several ways to address this.
&gt;&gt;&gt; One would be to have a single 'audio engine' process
&gt;&gt;&gt; and delegate all audio processing to it. That would
&gt;&gt;&gt; of course mean that all security is lost, a single
&gt;&gt;&gt; rogue audio routine could bring down everything. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Another solution would be to make Jack trigger port
&gt;&gt;&gt; or groups of ports instead of a process. So anything
&gt;&gt;&gt; in B that depends on A would run as soon as all output
&gt;&gt;&gt; from A that a part of B depends on is available. In
&gt;&gt;&gt; other words, the signal graphs becomes global. That
&gt;&gt;&gt; would also allow B to be a insert of A without adding
&gt;&gt;&gt; latency etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; But I'm dreaming. 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I second those concerns about better SMP system support,
&gt;&gt; but note that multiple JACK clients per process (which
&gt;&gt; is perfectly possible with jack2) already allows to do
&gt;&gt; (or at least to "test" even if the model is not perfect)
&gt;&gt; what you are speaking about.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but only if the dependencies are more or less static,
&gt; which is usually not the case. If they are not, you would
&gt; not only need to migrate modules from one client to another 
&gt; (possible), but also ports (hairy).
&gt; 
&gt; They way apps like A3 schedule their internal multithreaded
&gt; computation is entirely dynamic. A module is added to a
&gt; queue when all its inputs are available; sooner or later
&gt; one of the computation threads will take it there, execute
&gt; it and provide triggers for the next ones. There is no
&gt; static schedule, simply because without knowing the exact
&gt; execution time of each module you can't compute one.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to seamlessly integrate such networks then
&gt; the same thing should happen between processes. So, when
&gt; a Jack client has computed the signal on a particular
&gt; output port it should set that port to 'ready', Jack
&gt; transfers this status to all ports this one is connected
&gt; to, and the owners of those destinations decide what to
&gt; do. In theory. In practice part of that dynamic logic
&gt; will have to be pushed into Jack somehow to avoid useless
&gt; process switches. How to do that is the main challenge.

Discussion to be followed later on...

&gt; 
&gt; On a related topic: it seems that OSX now has a system
&gt; that allows a userland process to schedule a task to be
&gt; executed at a defined priority by a global 'engine', and
&gt; in a way that is much more efficient than creating a thread
&gt; for it. The way I understand it (which may be wrong) is that
&gt; it uses a pool of system threads instead. Do you know more
&gt; about this ? 

I guess you speak about Grand Central Dispatch (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Dispatch). The project has even a "open source" side called libdispatch (http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/).

I did some tests with it and the result is: it is interesting, a bit Apple centric for now with this new "Block" concept, linked with the LLVM project (which by itself is really really interesting, but also a bit Apple centric..)..., but "obviously" (I mean "as usual") not designed for real-time context, and "as usual" almost nobody ready and available to push anything in this direction.
