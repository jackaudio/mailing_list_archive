Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fwd: Compiling QjackCtl 0.3.8 on Windows XP

Hello everyone

I finally figure out how to compile qjackctl in Windows. The GUI works fine
by itself but, when I run it with a precompiled version of jackd, the GUI
suddenly closes (crashes) but the "jackd.exe" process still alive. I tried
with qjackctl 0.3.4 and 0.3.8 with Jack 1.9.5 and qjackctl had the same
behaviour.

I didn't modify the config.h file. The win32 part of src.pri file shows the
following:

win32 {

	CONFIG  += console

        INCLUDEPATH += C:\\Tesis\\qjackctl-0.3.4\\includes
C:\\Tesis\\qjackctl-0.3.4\\includes\\portaudio

        LIBS    += C:\\Tesis\\qjackctl-0.3.4\\lib\\libjack.lib
C:\\Tesis\\qjackctl-0.3.4\\lib\\libjackserver.lib
C:\\Tesis\\qjackctl-0.3.4\\lib\\portaudio_x86.lib

}


I included the jack and portaudio headers and the libraries libjack.lib,
libjackserver.lib and portaudio_x86.lib.

Well, as I said, when I try to start jackd from qjackctl (clicking the
"start" button), jack starts but qjackctl closes. Jackd process continues
but is not working. After kill the process I can run it again without
problems. When I try the inverse, I mean, start jackd server from console
and then qjackctl I got the following output:

Cannot read named pipe err = 109
HandleRequest: cannot read header

The version of Jackd is 1.9.5 and is the precompiled version for win32
included in the package.

Thanks in advanced for your suggestions.
