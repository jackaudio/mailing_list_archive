The GUI works fine by itself but, when I run it with a precompiled version of jackd, the GUI suddenly closes (crashes) but the "jackd.exe" process still alive. I tried with qjackctl 0.3.4 and 0.3.8 with Jack 1.9.5 and qjackctl had the same behaviour.

Why do you need to link with libjackserver.lib? Whihw symbols are needed?

After kill the process I can run it again without problems. When I try the inverse, I mean, start jackd server from console and then qjackctl I got the following output:
