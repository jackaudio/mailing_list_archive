Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Fwd: The Situation(s) With JACK

Paul,
I'm new to JACK (as you've all been aware this past few months =D ), and as
Stephane put it: I'm "not aware of JACK's power and elegance".
I'm sure that since many users/packagers/distros/developers (and other
people) are using it, you and your friends have developed a wonderful
product.

I wish I could help, but I can't.

I just wanted to say that you have presented a mature, thought-out self
criticism, and I'm sure that it took a lot from you to write this mail. I
hope that the responses you got to this letter by people anxious to know
what your proposal is, will urge you to continue working on JACK, and
deliver a better product.

So, I basically wish you good luck, and I too, wait to hear your proposal.

Royi Freifeld
