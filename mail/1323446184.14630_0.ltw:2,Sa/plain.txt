Check, but only in the form of header files (API) and associated documentation.

More than one.

      Control protocol: public, defined by an API
      Server/Library protocol: private, not defined, not accessible.
      Network streaming: at least three. Currently none are considered
to be "part of JACK", but rather just protocols used by jack clients.

Check, but insufficiently defined.

Check, but this sort of an implementation detail.
