&gt; JACK was invented to solve a very specific problem associated
 &gt; with a very particular type of workflow. Its solution has some
 &gt; tradeoffs that don't matter to the people who need what it does.
 &gt; Should the rest of the audio stack have to deal with this? Should
 &gt; pro-audio people have to deal with the tradeoffs caused by the
 &gt; design goals that desktop users want?

If ubiquitous broad adoption of Jack could be considered a good
thing, in that more users of all kinds will help flesh out issues
and provide extra feedback and extra fiscal support, then yes, it
may very well be in the best long term interest of Jack to be
re-engineered from the ground up to cater to non-pro end users.

There is one almighty difference between linux distros and winmac
systems and that is that the best of breed in all classes of
software can be included in various distros such that a pro-user
system like Jack, which would normally be excluded by cost of
purchase from proprietary OSs, can be embedded in any distro by
default. All linux distros *could* come with the best  audio
management system that has ever existed enabling every audio
application that ANY pro or non-pro end user may want to use
almost seemless inter operation, for free. That is something that
can never happen on winmac systems, an embedded professional
class audio server ready for work or play.

I've been using Jack via aloop for the past year, on standard
kernels, and the only point I find where it falls down is that
the Jack/aloop system chews up from 2% to 5% CPU resources even
when idling so unplugged laptop and mobile usage would be almost
out of the question. If this system would truly shut down and idle
when not used than, other than this point, it works really well!

I'm sure there are better and more efficient ways to run a Jack
system for everyday use but it's what I stumbled across when
looking for some way to get rid of pulse. My point is that Jack
already is (almost) the ideal non-pro desktop audio system.
