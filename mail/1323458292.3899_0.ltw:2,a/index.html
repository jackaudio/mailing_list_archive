&gt; 2. there is no defined API version that clients can be said to depend

&gt; 6. largely as a result of (2), distributions and applications are
&gt; starting to create a situation where despite the fact that Jack1 and
&gt; Jack2 are, in fact API and ABI compatible, explicit requirements for
&gt; Jack1 or Jack2 are in effect. They are wrong to do so, but their
&gt; reasons for doing so are entirely understandable.

From my experience with JACK as both a user and a programmer, this is
where I've felt the most pain.  By way of illustration...

$ find jack1 jack2 -name jack.pc.in | xargs grep ^Name
jack1/jack/jack.pc.in:Name: jack
jack2/jackmp/jack.pc.in:Name: jack

The pkg-config namespaces are the same, but because they're
individually versioned the usefulness of being able to do something
like PKG_CHECK_MODULES([jack], [jack &gt;= 0.117.0], ...) in an autoconf
file is destroyed.  JACK2 1.9.3 would satisfy the check, but would
fail to have the jack_on_info_shutdown symbol, so I end up having to
augment the check with AC_CHECK_LIB macros to ensure the symbol
I need is actually available, which is totally fine, it gets the job
done, it just makes me sad I can't use pkg-config where it normally
makes my life easier.  I mention this becuase if your proposal
involves introducing anything new, please consider adopting a new
namespace for it so it doesn't fall victim to the same problem, or
make the existing one worse.

Then there's the subtle differences between modes of failure that have
bit me, as a user, depending on which client library I'm using.  (see
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=643333 for example,
and I'll note jack.plumbing is not the only program I've seen affected
in that way, iirc jack_evmon fails the same way)

&gt; 4. JACK was one of the first audio APIs to provide network streaming,
&gt; but the existence of two incompatible implementations of netjack makes
&gt; network streaming more to difficult to explain than it is to actually
&gt; do. Both implementations have their benefits, but there is absolutely
&gt; no talk of any unification and some notable resistance to it. When the
&gt; typical question arises "Can I use JACK to stream audio from A to B?"
&gt; the answer is so complex that many people just give up (and probably
&gt; rightly so). Contrast this to, for example, using the AUNetSend and
&gt; AUNetReceive plugins on OS X. It just makes a mockery of netjack in
&gt; terms of ease of use (though latency is terrible).

Ease of use is fine and all, but my experience is that it means really
different things to different people.  One of the things I've really
liked about the JACK project so far, is that there's been a palpable
reluctance to paper over the hard problems and pretend they don't
exist.  When I sat down to set up JACK networking between my qemu-kvm
sandboxes and my workstation they run on, I ran into all kinds of
roadblocks because, indeed, it wasn't as straightforward as I'd
assumed it would be, but I learned a lot in the process because I kept
asking myself, "well why is it done that way?" and digging deeper.  I
really value that education, and I would congradulate the project for
not obscuring the challenges with hand-waving and glitter in the name
of adoption.  It does result in exposed complexity, but I'd rather be
faced with that, than ignorant of the compromises being made on my
behalf.

Another big reason why I keep using JACK is because of it's light
dependancies and lack of overbearing assumptions about my environment.
(I notice you've mentioned zeroconf discovery in the context of a
future network streaming protocol, and I admit that makes me a little
nervous, but hopefully there's still room in the future for explicit
point to point setups.)
