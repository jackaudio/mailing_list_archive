It is itune in the US. And a few other big players will come soon in
the rest of the world. Deezer is one of them.

I make a different analyse. With the digital technology, the structure
of the recording industry have changed. In the past, the important was
to own the recording equipment. They was very expensive. Now, anyone
that can afford a good pc can make its own recording studio, and that
even with free software like jack. In consequence, the important now is
to own the legal rights on the recordings.

Many musicians do understand that, and it is the first reason why it is
so many small recording companies now. On the long run, the only chance
for the majors are to take control over the distribution, that is
mainly over internet. But that is another discussion.

The video market is not in the same situation because it is still
harder to make its own video recording studio with a pc. But I think
that this is only a question of time for a video server similar to
jack to be possible on a high end pc.

For me, the big feature of using jack for the desktop is that I never
get annoyed by those stupid desktop sounds -:) It is also very easy to
setup.

And for the user, most linux distributiona are easier to manage than
windows. You launch an application or a command and you get a
centralised way to manage and update all the applications in the box.
With windows update, it will update only the OS and a few applications
like explorer. And you manage anything, the management is made by
microsoft, you must blindly trust it.

Another great difference is what I can call scale. On linux, it is very
few applications that make every thing but the coffee. Instead, we have
a lot of applications that make one task, but make it very well. On
windows, and I guess on mac too, it is a lot big applications that make
every thing but the coffee. It is why the most frequent question from
most if not all new linux user is which application to use to make
a task or to replace the xyz windows or mac software. Very often, the
answer is not to use one application, but to use a few applications,
each of them will do a part of the job.

I also think that a new linux user that is ready to take the time to
ask on the forums and email lists will fail in love with linux. He
will maybe never look back. He will eventually look to alternatives like
freebsd. But well, support is very important in a modern OS and what is
better than a fast and free support, especially when this support is
made by skilled peoples.
