Personally I found the jack transport specification always lacking in 
this respect. IMHO a better approach would be to just privide a very 
simple protocol, which is just framebased and provides just the states 
STOPPED, RUNNING and a shared frame number. Making assumptions about 
musical time, etc., is too restrictive.

To provide musical time interoperation between different audio apps an 
independent protocol could emerge and once it has matured one could 
again think about integrating it into jack transport..
