1. Stopped, Rolling and Starting are incomplete as well.

It's impossible to find out if everybody is ready to
start on cue without actually trying it and risk failure.
There should be a 4th state, 'Locating' or so, to allow a
client to indicate that it is not yet ready (and then
'Stopped' implies readyness of course, just as 'Rolling'
does.).

2. It should be possible to have more than one transport
state. For at least 3 concerts this year I had two or more
players (Ardour) which needed their transport synced with
e.g. effects sequencers, and which were used at the same
time but independent of each other. Had to hack something
using audio ports to transfer data.
