&gt; lacking? you say its lacking but then ask for a very simple protocol:

Yes, because musical time is outside the range of what jack should IMHO 
provide. What musical time is, and how it is shared between different 
applications can be very application-specific.

&gt;&gt; IMHO a better approach would be to just privide a very simple
&gt; which we have!

True :D

&gt;&gt; protocol, which is just framebased and provides just the states STOPPED,
&gt;&gt; RUNNING and a shared frame number. Making assumptions about musical time,
&gt;&gt; etc., is too restrictive.
&gt; STOPPED and RUNNING can't accomodate slow-sync clients.

That's true. Here's a different approach maybe: Make clients share a map 
of locations that can be relocated to (Slow sync clients could prebuffer 
their state, so relocations/loops can be immediate). Make the update of 
this shared map non-RT, but require clients to be able to relocate to 
any of the shared locations immediately.

My point is: How to implement looping/musical time/etc., is for me still 
subject to discussion and therefore should not be cast in stone in the 
jack spec. Rather I'd like to see an independent spec to emerge for this 
and once it is ready and well tested, then one can think about 
reintegrating it into jack itself..

I have the feeling that the looping stuff and the musical time stuff are 
instances of a more general problem: How can jack apps share state 
besides the data passed around via ports? If there was a general 
mechanism for jack apps to share (broadcast/pull) additional state, then 
apps that want to provide notions of musical time or looping, etc, could 
use this mechanism to implement this. Providing a playing ground for 
experiments with this kind of things..

Maybe i just need more coffee though ;D

&gt;&gt; To provide musical time interoperation between different audio apps an
&gt;&gt; independent protocol could emerge and once it has matured one could again
&gt;&gt; think about integrating it into jack transport..
&gt; we've had the simple protocol for years now. we've also had MMC for
&gt; even longer, which is totally independent of JACK but has been
&gt; integrated into via jackmmcctl or whatever its called.
&gt;
&gt; i recommend reading the wiki page cited on this. it has an excellent
&gt; discussion of the entire issue.

OK, will do so. Thanks for the pointer..
