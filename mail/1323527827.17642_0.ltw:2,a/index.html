&gt; 1. Stopped, Rolling and Starting are incomplete as well.

&gt; It's impossible to find out if everybody is ready to

&gt; There should be a 4th state, 'Locating' or so, to allow a

&gt; 'Stopped' implies readyness of course, just as 'Rolling'
&gt; does.).

Oh :)

&gt; For at least 3 concerts this year I had two or more
&gt; players (Ardour) which needed their transport synced with
&gt; e.g. effects sequencers, and which were used at the same
&gt; time but independent of each other. Had to hack something
&gt; using audio ports to transfer data.

A few years back I was proposing to have additional transport/time
information per audio port.

Basically each track could have its own transport or be linked with an
offset to the main transport.
