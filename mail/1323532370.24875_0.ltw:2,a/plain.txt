Although I appreciate the sentiment, its very important to me that the
discussion focuses on solving the problems that have been caused by
the multiple implementations of various parts of JACK rather than draw
up a wishlist of new features. That is a valuable task in itself, but
until we have a focused, manageable project underway again, such a
list isn't going to be much use.

Regarding a2jmidid integration, I referred to this obliquely in my
feature list when I said:

    bridges/routers for platform specific APIs (ALSA (pcm & MIDI),
CoreAudio, CoreMIDI, winMIDI, ASIO, other?)
