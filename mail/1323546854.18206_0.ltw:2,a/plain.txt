"Hopefully lead to a union efforts," imo, should be "MUST lead to a 
union of efforts." Personalities and preferences be damned. Whatever 
comes out of this won't be unambiguous successor to Jack1 and Jack2 if 
developer efforts continue to be divided.

Maintaining sets of patches on the side isn't a problem, but we can't 
have >1 mainline anymore. (I guess that's what you mean below when you 
say "single tree for header files.")

Standing ovation!

(I request that the control app expose more of the functionality of Jack 
(specifically Netjack, along with other modules) directly. That's 
something that will come with time.)
