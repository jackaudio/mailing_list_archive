Le 9 d&#xE9;c. 2011 &#xE0; 19:43, Paul Davis a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; This is my list of fundamental requirements for the next stage of JACK:
&gt; 
&gt; * the JACK 1.0 API must be defined first
&gt; * it must clearly, unambiguously and incontrovertibly be the successor
&gt; to Jack1 and Jack2
&gt;     - this probably means that it must emerge relatively quickly
&gt; once/if work begins on it
&gt; * it cannot assume that Stephane will stop working on Jack2 or that
&gt; myself will stop working on Jack1, or that anybody else will stop
&gt;      working on anything else at all BUT it hopefully will lead to a
&gt; union of efforts.
&gt; * it must recognize that neither Jack1 nor Jack2 are likely to just
&gt; "die", so any plans must include them to some extent.
&gt; * it must provide a single soname (ABI, effectively) that identifies
&gt; any implementation and can be used by packagers and app developers
&gt; * every feature of Jack2 and Jack1 that people agree is worth
&gt; retaining should be available
&gt; * it must not increase and should preferably decrease replicated
&gt; developer effort
&gt; * it must be API and ABI compatible with current JACK releases
&gt; * it must run on Windows, OS X and Linux and preferably Solaris and
&gt; the BSD family
&gt; * it should make possible end-user features that are agreed to be important
&gt; 
&gt; This is what I think the future looks like:
&gt; 
&gt; Features
&gt; 
&gt;    C API/ABI
&gt;    C++ implementation
&gt;    synchronous mode (server waits for all clients)
&gt;    asynchronous mode (slow clients have no impact)
&gt;          - possible to avoid zombification, always
&gt;    parallel graph execution
&gt;    click-free connection/disconnection
&gt;    full memory locking when platform supports it
&gt;    memory use for ports proportional to number of ports
&gt;    no fixed limit on number of ports
&gt;    2 thread execution in libjack (from Jack2; one for process, one
&gt; for other callbacks)
&gt;    multiple device support handled by server (from Jack2, but with
&gt; the quality of alsa_in/alsa_out)
&gt;    full control protocol
&gt;    full support for device sharing with PulseAudio
&gt;    realtime device switching (without stopping/restarting server)
&gt; 
&gt; Desirable features to be merged from outside JACK "core"
&gt; 
&gt;   1 streaming network protocol, for LAN and WAN use, with zeroconf
&gt; discovery or similar
&gt;   bridges/routers for platform specific APIs (ALSA (pcm &amp; MIDI),
&gt; CoreAudio, CoreMIDI, winMIDI, ASIO, other?)
&gt;   control protocol access from (at least) D-Bus, perhaps others
&gt;       - probably via helper components; not built into server but
&gt; possibly loaded by it.
&gt; 
&gt; Development Prerequisites
&gt; 
&gt;  build system: waf
&gt;  source code management: git
&gt;  single header file tree, for use by jack1, jack2 and anything else
&gt;  single tool dir tree, for use by jack1, jack2 and anything else
&gt;  **proposal** use Boost widely to accelerate development and leverage existing
&gt;      work.
&gt; 
&gt; User Interface
&gt; 
&gt;  single session manager app that can also be used to start/stop/configure JACK
&gt;  existing control apps (qjackctl, patchage, etc) continue to be options

You are basically describing the current state of JACK2 *minus* some parts....

Do you really want to start a JACK3 project with a new implementation ??

I don't know what to say more...
