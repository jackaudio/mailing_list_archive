no way! don't do that - after Torbens/tschacks' disappearance i have 
been 'forced'  this week to implement netjack2 and i'm amazed at how 
much improvement there has been! I'm using 4k jumbo packets on giglan 
now flawlessly; i'm using -S @ -l1 with only rare xruns, mostly caused 
when doing disk grabs under wine for vsti's . overall very impressed. 
extremely easy to get running and very impressive performance.

  with the above settings and with 80 I/O round trip is about 3.3ms 
according to jack_delay.

so, the code has been much improved over the last 2 years when i last 
used it, and it works extremely well now for my purposes. so please 
don't remove it :)

best
