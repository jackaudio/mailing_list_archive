&gt;&gt; You're also ignoring the need to have a single netjack streaming

&gt;
&gt; I don't think we're there yet, i.e. neither netjack1 nor netjack2 is
&gt; sufficient for all the use cases. They both look to me like
&gt; prove-of-concepts that demonstrate certain things, but lack through
&gt; engineering in other respects. E.g. how to accommodate future extensions
&gt; (header-length fields, other codecs [than celt,float], ...).
&gt;
&gt; And while it is a nice thought of having only jack with exactly one
&gt; perfectly tailored network protocol, reality is not so perfect. We should
&gt; not forget that there are other network protocols out there (AVB, Dante,
&gt; etc.) that some might want to see interoperating with jack at some point in
&gt; the future. And there are people out there that would be willing to connect
&gt; via netjack, but without using jack at one end -- and need good
&gt; documentation of the wire format. &#xA0;From this perspective, and thinking of
&gt; possible dependencies like DNS-SD, I'm even not too sure, if network
&gt; protocols (esp. the "network manager" part should be "designed into the jack
&gt; core".
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Another thing that has been brought up in the discussion is a standardized
&gt; driver API for all implementations. IMHO this could have a big impact on
&gt; jacks future.

OK, I agree with all that you've said here. So, let me put it another way:

  * when users ask how to stream audio over a LAN or a WAN with JACK,
       there needs to be a concise, understandable and clear answer
       for them.

I'm not really invested in any particular way to provide an answer to
that question, but we *do* need that answer. Right now, we don't have
it.
