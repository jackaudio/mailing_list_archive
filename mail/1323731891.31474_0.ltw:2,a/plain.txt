OK, I agree with all that you've said here. So, let me put it another way:

  * when users ask how to stream audio over a LAN or a WAN with JACK,
       there needs to be a concise, understandable and clear answer
       for them.

I'm not really invested in any particular way to provide an answer to
that question, but we *do* need that answer. Right now, we don't have
it.
