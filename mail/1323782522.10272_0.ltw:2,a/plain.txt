See the JACK2 ChangeLog quite long "contributors" section. All of them should be thanked for all their great work that make the code base better, mode robust and more easily maintainable.

Could we first precisely describe that?

Part of the problem was a lack of clear vision for the future of the code base : what is supposed to be the code base reference to be worked on?

Note that NetJack1 has been added in JACK2 tree since something like 2 years. If the community wants NetJack2 out of the tree, then it will need some work for us to "detach" in a maintainable way, but it can certainly be done. But I will not put any energy into NetJack1maintenance.

Assuming we can define a "common minimal set of needed features": can we describe that?

My point is that I'm not sure this framework makes sense outside of the ALSA context, since for instance CoreAudio does "multiple device aggregation" at a lower level. But I may be wrong. And anyway the needs have to be refined. I don't have a clear view of them. Do you?

OK.

Grame wrote the CoreAudio backend, Grame wrote the first version of CoreMidi backend (later improved by Devin Anderson). Grame wrote the first version of WinMME backend (later improved by Devin Anderson). Grame wrote the PortAudio backend for Windows (supporting every API PortAudio supports, that is WinMMe, DirectSound, ASIO). Grame wrote a Solaris version in 2008.

If the new proposal is not really a new implementation, I still don't see what is it exactly. Without any new developers working on "non" Linux parts, I don't see how the new proposal can succeed.

1) We have to list  "Jack1 and Jack2 each distinct benefits"

2) We have to choose what is the reference code base

3) We have to establish a plan for the reference code base to evolve until it reach the list of expected features.
