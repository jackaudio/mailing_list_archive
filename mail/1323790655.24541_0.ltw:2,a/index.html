Ok, lets be realistic. We have 3 different categories of problems:

   1) things that make it harder or impossible for multiple
implementations of JACK from being as fully compatible with each other
as they could be
   2) things that users (reasonably) want that one or other
implementations of JACK currently does not do. This is somewhat
affected by
           the split in developer effort, but its also somewhat
independent of it.
   3) the issues that occur when distributions and users are forced to
choose between implementations

What I'm hearing from you is that there is no way you can imagine
fixing (3). I don't know if I agree or not, but lets just assume that
its true.

Could we agree to do what is needed to solve (1) and also provide
proper guidance and information regarding (3) ? This would then allow
the current fractured state of development, which looks unlikely to go
away, to at least continue with a defined set of headers and a defined
ABI/soname?

If so, then the resolution of (2) is just going to come down to who
does the work and for which implementation of JACK. Not a good
situation but at least better than we have now.
