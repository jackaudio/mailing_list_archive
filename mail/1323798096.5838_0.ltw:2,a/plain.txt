So basically Paul you still don't want to choose... 

Grame position is quite clear: we are committed to work on JACK2 codebase, which basically implement a superset of JACK1 features (http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/Q_differenc_jack1_jack2). If critical lacks in JACK2 (present in JACK1) are identified and are considered mandatory, please list them first. We consider that this basic choice has to be done first.
