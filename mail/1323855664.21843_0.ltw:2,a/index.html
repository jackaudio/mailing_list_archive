&gt; &gt;&gt; Already possible in NetJack2 (that is in SVN tree and in future 1.9.8
&gt; &gt;&gt; version): the "network stack" in available as a pure C API defined
&gt; &gt;&gt; here:
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/trunk/jackmp/common/jack/net.
&gt; &gt;&gt; h and compiled in a separated library called "libjacknet".&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ok, I certainly know more about netjack1 than netjack2. But I'm also
&gt; &gt; thinking here about hardware implementations (e.g. VHDL + Soft-CPU).
&gt; OK.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and need good documentation of the wire format.  From this
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perspective, and thinking of possible dependencies like DNS-SD, I'm
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; even not too sure, if network protocols (esp. the "network manager"
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; part should be "designed into the jack core".&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Let me explain how NetJack2 is currently structured: [...]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you. What I meant was, that from my experience with other network
&gt; &gt; audio protocols, that there is a "manager" part (maybe with auto-master
&gt; &gt;  ability by an election protocol), which handles the "who connects to
&gt; &gt; whom", and the parameter stuff, and there is the "raw audio transfer"
&gt; &gt; part.
&gt; OK. This is "somewhat" done like that, but can be certainly be improved. I'm
&gt; open to every proposal.
&gt; &gt; The other thing I'm kind of undecided about is the usage of Multicast in
&gt; &gt; netjack2. On one hand it sure has merrits,
&gt; It was done like that back in 2008 when we started this work with Romain
&gt; Moret.
&gt; &gt; OTOH I can't stop asking myself: do we really need it, are there other
&gt; &gt; ways, etc. And then, if we really need it / want it, maybe only for
&gt; &gt; some cases (say, ease of use), why not use some standardized mechanisms
&gt; &gt; like multicast DNS-SD, ...
&gt; Could certainly be done with more standard ways.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) An "adapter" concept : basically the idea is to "adapt" the network
&gt; &gt;&gt; stream on the slave audio system. [...] Adapters are also developed
&gt; &gt;&gt; as "in-server" JACK clients.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maybe this questions are stupid (I'm sure lacking good knowledge of
&gt; &gt; jacks internals), but I'm not sure I really understand it: - "in-server
&gt; &gt; JACK client"   is whats essentially called "plugin" in other software?
&gt; Yes in some way.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - to get the audio into jack in this case, the "backend/driver API" is
&gt; &gt; used?
&gt; No: an "in-server JACK client" uses the same client API (with some
&gt; differences to open/close the client). Then it is compiled a a shared lib,
&gt; (or DLL) and then dynamically loaded in the server.
&gt; &gt; - and is it correct to say the big difference between a driver and a
&gt; &gt; client, that the backend/driver provides the timing?
&gt; More or less yes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; My general felling is that this design already has some qualities that
&gt; &gt;&gt; make more suitable for future evolutions in the right direction. The
&gt; &gt;&gt; "in-server" JACK clients model allows fine control with any strong
&gt; &gt;&gt; control API based approach (like the DBus+ladish one), since
&gt; &gt;&gt; in-server client can be configurated and loaded/unloaded dynamically
&gt; &gt;&gt; in the server. NetJack2 is currently limited to LAN, so the real
&gt; &gt;&gt; weakness (compared to NetJack1) is the lack of "internet" support for
&gt; &gt;&gt; the data transfer protocol. Here again, we have to choose the right
&gt; &gt;&gt; horse...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm sure not against netjack2, but my software developer-nature really
&gt; &gt; desires to break things down into well-separated pieces with defined
&gt; &gt; (internal) API. My way of solving programming problems is by defining
&gt; &gt; APIs.
&gt; Make sense. Right now part of this "well-separated pieces" are described as
&gt; C++ classes or interfaces.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Another thing that has been brought up in the discussion is a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; standardized driver API for all implementations. IMHO this could
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have a big impact on jacks future.&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; JACK2 used a C++ based class hierarchy for drivers. This model allows
&gt; &gt;&gt; to share common behaviors in a base JackAudioDriver class. Then real
&gt; &gt;&gt; drivers for specific API have to be developed as a subclass of it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; See the PortAudio driver as an simple example: [...]&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd would like to see a C driver API, but that's only a nuance.
&gt; 
&gt; Sometime C++ inheritance mechanism add more flexibility.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My general intention is to say: Don't think of jack as a monolithic
&gt; &gt; entity, but of exchangeable parts, even if we risk even more user
&gt; &gt; confusion in the short-term.
&gt; I perfectly agree ((-;... Basically I'm proposing a C++ based more modular
&gt; design and implementation since something like...2005 and after initial war
&gt; "C versus C++"...  now we are in 2011 and there is still no clear choice of
&gt; what code base should be used.
&gt; &gt; And one word about jack2's usage of C++... my feeling, when looking at
&gt; &gt; the code, is that jack2 classes are essentially "C code" where every
&gt; &gt; method or whatever is packed into some other class, because C++ has
&gt; &gt; classes, but not because it makes the structure clearer. The term "C++
&gt; &gt; code" however means to me, that e.g. classes are used, where they
&gt; &gt; provide encapsulation of a certain behavior, that C structures and
&gt; &gt; free-standing functions are used, where this is the most fitting
&gt; &gt; abstraction, templates are used for ..., etc. -- to put it in one word:
&gt; &gt; readability
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tobias
&gt; 
&gt; This is a mix of real inheritance base C++ code (for backend/driver),
&gt; clients... and sometimes use of C++ typing system with a compilation time
&gt; choice of what actual class has to be used (for server/client communication
&gt; channels, synchronization primitives....). This is the result of gradual
&gt; evolution over time, and choice between what C++ virtual method mecanism is
&gt; helpful for or possibly "removes"  (like some speed in some precise
&gt; cases..)
&gt; 
&gt; But yes, not pure C++.
&gt; 
&gt; But the question is still always the same: does the the jack-dev community
&gt; think the "C code base" can be used to continue development, or the "C++
&gt; code base" (even will all it's imperfections that we can discuss and
&gt; comment forever....., but that we can also gradually improve).
&gt; 
&gt; This choice has to be done now.
&gt;

&gt; 

Thanks for explaining, I was about to ask why hesitation to fully embrace C++?
Technical?
Would it say, cause embedded HW code to grow, eating up space?
Or some third party possibly legacy code to break?

It's neat that both versions 1 + 2 API currently 'just work' - for now, but 
 is it a luxury which can't last much longer?

Anyway modern C++ gets my ++.
Watching the threads, thanks. Tim.
