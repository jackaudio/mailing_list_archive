Well it was more historical: first version in 2005 was more C++ like (with base class and virtual methods and so on....). This was changed later one in some parts were virtual methods were not so useful.  But anyway this is not so important.

The point is that is 'just work' .... almost.

And one way to improve the situation is to make a clear choice or the reference code base.
