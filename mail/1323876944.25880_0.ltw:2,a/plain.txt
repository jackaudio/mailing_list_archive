I second everything you just said.

JACK has enjoyed contributions from a list of very talented, dedicated people and has become something very valuable. I agree with Paul's feelings that there are real problems with the current arrangement. If efforts can be unified I think this will be a great thing.

Of course, we seem to be left with a choice between Paul et al moving to a codebase they don't entirely agree with (and given the huge amount of effort it would be for them to do such a move, I can well understand that they would rather be moving to something they like) - or between Stéphane's group having to redo huge quantities of work they already consider finished.

If there are conceptual issues with JACK2's implementation (and it sounds as if there are) it is always tempting to consider a re-architecture. But I'm not able to even comment on how much work it would be. Will a new implementation in "proper C++" would save a lot of future effort? It might be more of an investment than a cost, particularly if it is felt that new people would be better able to get to grips with the code.
