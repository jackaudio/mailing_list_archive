 &gt;&gt; Paul replied:
&gt;&gt; i don't think that *anyone* believes that the C code base of JACK1
 &gt;&gt; is an appropriate thing to keep developing. certainly I do not.

So it seems that JACK1 is now "officially" dead. That "solves" a
lot of potential problems and arguments.

&gt;&gt; the questions is: (given that) we (active JACK developers all)
&gt;&gt; want/need a C++ implementation. is the JACK2 codebase the right
&gt;&gt; starting point for that, or do we gain something by doing a new
&gt;&gt; implementation that draws from JACK2 but leverages boost (among other
&gt;&gt; things) and uses fully idiomatic C++ unless doing so compromises
&gt;&gt; performance notably.
&gt;
 &gt; St&#xE9;phane continued:
&gt; OK, assuming the answer to "do we gain something by doing a new
 &gt; implementation" is yes, the next question is : who is going todo
 &gt; that? who is going to do multi-OS support? who is going to port
 &gt; current specific code (backend, bridges?) to this now code base?
 &gt; who is going to debug/test it?

It seems the quasi-consensus is that a total rewrite would solve many
current and future problems. Unlike for both JACK1 and JACK2 there is
now a decade of JACK usage and history to leverage for a redesign but
the man hours required is huge so plan on the best possible intermediate
compromise with JACK2 while laying the foundation for JACK3.

As a long term interested non-developer the obvious path forward to
me is that whatever functionality that JACK1 has that JACK2 does not
needs to be ported across, if possible, and then use JACK2 as *the*
canonical reference codebase for the next 12 to 24 months that it
will take for the planning and initial deployment of JACK3.
