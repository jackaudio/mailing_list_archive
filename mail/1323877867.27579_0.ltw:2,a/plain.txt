So it seems that JACK1 is now "officially" dead. That "solves" a
lot of potential problems and arguments.

It seems the quasi-consensus is that a total rewrite would solve many
current and future problems. Unlike for both JACK1 and JACK2 there is
now a decade of JACK usage and history to leverage for a redesign but
the man hours required is huge so plan on the best possible intermediate
compromise with JACK2 while laying the foundation for JACK3.

As a long term interested non-developer the obvious path forward to
me is that whatever functionality that JACK1 has that JACK2 does not
needs to be ported across, if possible, and then use JACK2 as *the*
canonical reference codebase for the next 12 to 24 months that it
will take for the planning and initial deployment of JACK3.
