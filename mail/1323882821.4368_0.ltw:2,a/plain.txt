    As a long term interested non-developer the obvious path forward to
    me is that whatever functionality that JACK1 has that JACK2 does not
    needs to be ported across, if possible, and then use JACK2 as *the*
    canonical reference codebase for the next 12 to 24 months that it
    will take for the planning and initial deployment of JACK3.


At this point I would like to ask whether jack2's codebase is considered 
to be beyond rescue wrt. to the C++ Paul would like to see, or if this 
could be done incrementally, so we don't loose a working implementation, 
and gain a better codebase in the future. Sure changes to class 
hierarchies and internal APIs will not be a small task, but a rewrite 
will require more or less equally much work.

The other unclear thing now however is that of how future development, 
new features, API changes, etc. are to be effectively steered and decided.
