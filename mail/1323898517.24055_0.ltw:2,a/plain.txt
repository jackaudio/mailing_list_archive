1. I'm not at all convinced that Paul's statement quoted above is
true. Sure, the jack1 code would benefit from a 'spring cleanup'.
Which is only normal after all those years (*). And I also think
it could be the basis of a C++ implementation that would be a bit
more transparent than the Jack2 one. There is a lot of 'object'
style thinking in it as it is.

2. A completely separate matter - I'd like to ask and invite
anyone to respond: is there any serious Linux Audio *USER*
out there who cares about Jack on Windows ? I certainly do not.
All I want is the best possible tools on Linux (and let OSX be
a corner case). Note that I'm asking *USERS*. For a developer
there may be some gratification in knowing that his/her work is
invading the proprietary world. He/she may even believe that
this will lure Windows users into switching to Linux. I don't
think that it would: the better it works on Windows the less
reason anyone has to change.

Ciao,

(*) Writing this I can't help thinking of Paul Simon's 'Still
crazy...'.
