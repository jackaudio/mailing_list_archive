Not only that. The more viable JACK is as a genuinely cross-platform
technology, the more chance there is that developers will use and thus
making porting their applications to, or developing new applications
for Linux that much more likely. JACK has the big benefit, thanks to
Stephane's work, that it can be used without any changes in native
apps on both Windows and OS X, so that users of applications on those
platforms can benefit from JACK without any developers of those apps
doing anything. But it would still be nice if they actually actively
supported it (as a few do).
