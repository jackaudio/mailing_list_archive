Ardour 2 and 3 both run on Windows. There has been no release of
Ardour for Windows.

This is one of the main reasons why there has been no release.

JACK is not "an app". Its plumbing. It is already cross-platform. It
is already released for 5 major OS platforms (Linux, OS X, Windows,
BSD, Solaris). The situation is very different from the question of
whether or not app Foobar should be released on Windows when it
currently does not exist for that platform.
