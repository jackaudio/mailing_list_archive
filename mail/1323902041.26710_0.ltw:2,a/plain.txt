As a Jack user on Linux, OS-X and Windows, I want to thank the Jack2
developers for their cross-platform support. My main audio usage is
virtual pipe organ applications - and being able to build Fluidsynth
for Windows with Jack for Windows native support is a major
breakthrough for jOrgan users on the Windows platform... There will
likely be native Jack for Windows support in a couple of other Windows
audio apps in the next six months.

Waste of time? No way. Jack's user base is growing on the Windows platform...
