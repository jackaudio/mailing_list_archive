Hey fons,

If you were to say 'care deeply' - then i would be forced to respond,
no. but i would say from my own experiences, i would have to consider
my answer to be 'yes, i do (mildly) care...lol  I primarily use Linux
for proaudio, and my desktop in general. But i do also use Mac (and
oddly first started using Jack on Mac, before using it heavily in
linux). So i am a prime example, of why cross-platform is good. (you
can just swap out 'Windows' in your above statement and replace it
with 'MacOSX').

Jack didn't 'bring me' to the linux platform (as i had already used it
for quite a while @ work and home), but after the linux desktop
started to shape up(a few years ago) jack certainly brought me to
consider linux for proaudio, and the Mac port was honestly my
introduction to the usefulness of jackaudio ...and at the time, i was
well-aware it was ported to MacOSX from linux.

Personally, i can see the benefits in some cases of having windows
users - but i think that is a not-so-good motivation to have ~ if the
point of porting jack to windows was to try to grab up users to
linux...that seems a little dishonest, or sneeky. Instead they should
realize on their own that they could use linux for proaudio/jack. The
problem is of course, i would say this hardly matters - because 99% of
musicians/producers i know still would find Gnu/linux too technical to
install/configure/maintain.

I tend to think that the motivation would be to have cross-platform,
and thus interplay between any and all OSes, across machines..  I
think that's more exciting. besides that, i can't really comment on if
windows users would eventually contribue useful code to jack (that
would be useful on all platforms). i have no idea.

that's my 2 cents from a (non-windows) user perspective.
