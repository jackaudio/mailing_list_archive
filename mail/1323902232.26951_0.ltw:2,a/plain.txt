Still maintaining it for all those platforms means extra work,
and less time for real development.

You yourself suggested in your original post that Jack's development
should be driven by user requirements. Now ask yourself who are your
users. I bet they are 90% Linux. And those have no interest at all
in any Windows/xxx/yyy version. Go for it if you have spare capacity.
Or make it a GSOC project. But don't waste any time on it otherwise.
Even it that hurts.
