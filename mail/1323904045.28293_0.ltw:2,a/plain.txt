JACK *already* runs on Windows. Stephane took care of this. Maybe it
could work better. Maybe not. It would be nice if some skilled
programmers with Windows experience took care of that, sure ... but
.... developing/furthering/improving facilities like netjack so that
it is possible to stream audio back and forth between different
platforms is in fact one of the most common reasons people seek out
JACK. Doing this improves life for everyone, including Linux users,
and has the other benefits mentioned earlier in this thread.
