&gt; &gt; You yourself suggested in your original post that Jack's development
&gt; &gt; should be driven by user requirements. Now ask yourself who are your
&gt; &gt; users. I bet they are 90% Linux. And those have no interest at all
&gt; &gt; in any Windows/xxx/yyy version. Go for it if you have spare capacity.
&gt; &gt; Or make it a GSOC project. But don't waste any time on it otherwise.
&gt; &gt; Even it that hurts.
&gt; 
&gt; JACK *already* runs on Windows. Stephane took care of this.

Jack2 runs on Windows. Jack1 doesn't. And it seems rather clear
that you don't see the Jack2 code as a basis for the future. If
you would then the 'Berlin path' should have been taken years
ago and it wasn't. Given that

* you and Torben don't see Jack2 as the future basis,
* Grame has no good reason to abandon Jack2 for an 
  alternative C++ version,

it seems that you are condamned to either

1. change your ideas about the Jack2 code base and abandon
   Jack1 (unlikely),
2. or go on with Jack1 as it is,
3. or create a C++ version separate from the Grame one,
   starting either from zero or from the Jack1 code base.

In cases 2 and 3, you don't have Windows support, and my point is
that you shouldn't waste time on it until at least the current
crisis has ended and the existing problems on *Linux* (such as
distros being driven to force one or the other version on users)
have been solved. That is just a matter of defining priorities.
