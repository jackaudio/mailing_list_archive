Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: The Situation(s) With JACK

Hi everyone,

Please don't abandon Windows users of Jack...!!
Especially jOrganers depend on it , also GrandOrgue and Hauptwerk ones.

In my case 1.9.8 for both 32 &64bit win7 does miracles on desktop level, allowing me to use anything I want in any way I choose.
I'm not a software programmer, but a musician and user first. So, everything depends on how a program good on serving music is.


I simply don't understand why some OS must be abandoned.
Stephane did a wonderful work on 1.9.8 why must all this work go waste?
There is room for all...

Best
Panos

I certainly do care a lot about JACK on Linux and Mac and Windows! Being able to run my software on all three platforms is absolutely mandatory for me.
