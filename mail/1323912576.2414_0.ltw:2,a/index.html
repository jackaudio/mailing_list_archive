&gt; &gt; i don't think that *anyone* believes that the C code base of JACK1 is
&gt; &gt; an appropriate thing to keep developing. certainly I do not. even
&gt; &gt; though its actually easier to add a new callback to JACK1 than to
&gt; &gt; JACK2, its completely obvious that the JACK1 codebase is dead as a
&gt; &gt; future/longterm development path.
&gt;
&gt; 1. I'm not at all convinced that Paul's statement quoted above is
&gt; true. Sure, the jack1 code would benefit from a 'spring cleanup'.
&gt; Which is only normal after all those years (*). And I also think
&gt; it could be the basis of a C++ implementation that would be a bit
&gt; more transparent than the Jack2 one. There is a lot of 'object'
&gt; style thinking in it as it is.
&gt;
&gt; 2. A completely separate matter - I'd like to ask and invite
&gt; anyone to respond: is there any serious Linux Audio *USER*
&gt; out there who cares about Jack on Windows ? I certainly do not.
&gt; All I want is the best possible tools on Linux (and let OSX be
&gt; a corner case). Note that I'm asking *USERS*. For a developer
&gt; there may be some gratification in knowing that his/her work is
&gt; invading the proprietary world. He/she may even believe that
&gt; this will lure Windows users into switching to Linux. I don't
&gt; think that it would: the better it works on Windows the less
&gt; reason anyone has to change.
&gt;
&gt;
Well I'm only a user and i do write music. I absolutely adore fruityloops
(which runs on windows)
and was blown away when i realised the network power of jack..
I could add network effects, use different computer for audio in /audio
out..

surely fruity loops can run on wine (with problems) , but when 'rewiring'
other applications into
fruity loops, you get a huge chain of audio apps that are becoming complex
to work from within wine.

I would very much like to keep me the option of jackifying applications on
windows..

&gt; Ciao,
&gt;
&gt; (*) Writing this I can't help thinking of Paul Simon's 'Still
