Well I'm only a user and i do write music. I absolutely adore fruityloops
(which runs on windows)
and was blown away when i realised the network power of jack..
I could add network effects, use different computer for audio in /audio
out..

surely fruity loops can run on wine (with problems) , but when 'rewiring'
other applications into
fruity loops, you get a huge chain of audio apps that are becoming complex
to work from within wine.

I would very much like to keep me the option of jackifying applications on
windows..
