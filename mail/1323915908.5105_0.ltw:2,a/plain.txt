When I need to use Windows audio software, I connect machines using MIDI 
and SPDIF, or in extreme cases, ADAT. Using a network-based transport on 
Windows, for my particular workflow, is superfluous.

Since the only thing I use Windows for anymore is Team Fortress 2, 
Cubase, and a few things that will never get ported, there is really no 
reason for me ever to use Jack on Windows.
