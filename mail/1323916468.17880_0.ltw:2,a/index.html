Sorry for the noise.

While *I* wouldn't use it, I think JACK and Ardour on Windows would be 
incredibly valuable, if for nothing else, than for money. My 
recollection is that Ardour started reaching its financial goals once OS 
X downloads started strongly encouraging / requiring a donation.

One other question:

If there were to be a basically new JACK C++ tree, how much could be 
kept from what we already have? Header files for sure, right? Would it 
be worth taking a few hours to draw some pictures and diagrams of what 
classes and inheritances we would need, and consider how much, if any, 
code could just be brought over verbatim?
