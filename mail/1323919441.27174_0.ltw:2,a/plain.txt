It's unnecessary to take that route.

Paul has identified significant issues on his part with the codebase for
jack2. It affects others too. Stephane has said he agrees there is room
for adjusting the codebase of jack2 to make it easier for people to work
with who do have problems with the current implementation.

Hence we just have to identify the areas that need to be fixed and make
them easier for everyone to work with. In the process we should end up
with a more powerful system.

As long as someone has time to commit to the refactoring process it's a
win win. We end up with a single codebase that everyone is happy to work
which makes it easier for packaging and we all can move forward.
