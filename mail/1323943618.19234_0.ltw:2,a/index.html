&gt;&gt;&gt; i don't think that *anyone* believes that the C code

&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly I do not.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The referenced message was probably the most concise I have seen so far
&gt;&gt; regarding JACK1.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Going from the other direction, what is lost by just saying that Grame is
&gt;&gt; now the maintainer of JACK, and even though JACK1 developers do not
&gt;&gt; particularly like working on the JACK2 code, they just punt and let
&gt;&gt; Stephane et al. implement any future changes.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Have there been any API changes except for the latency changes in the last
&gt;&gt; couple of years?  Are any additional changes currently planned?  Is there
&gt;&gt; any reason that for future changes the implementation of the changes could
&gt;&gt; not just be left to the JACK2 developers, while the (previous) JACK1
&gt;&gt; developers just concentrate on application development?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It's unnecessary to take that route.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul has identified significant issues on his part with the codebase for
&gt; jack2. It affects others too. Stephane has said he agrees there is room
&gt; for adjusting the codebase of jack2 to make it easier for people to work
&gt; with who do have problems with the current implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence we just have to identify the areas that need to be fixed and make
&gt; them easier for everyone to work with. In the process we should end up
&gt; with a more powerful system.
&gt; 
&gt; As long as someone has time to commit to the refactoring process it's a
&gt; win win. We end up with a single codebase that everyone is happy to work
&gt; which makes it easier for packaging and we all can move forward.
&gt; 

I'm sure we can find a satisfactory solution for everyone that as the same time reuse part of the code (like OS specific backend/bridge) and redesign some part (or all) of the "core JACK", using more modern design/library (like boost....): 

-using boost would probably allow to abstract : multi-OS server/client communications channels, synchronization primitives, threads (although we have to precisely look at real-time thread support...), shared memory manager... This would allow to remove a lot of code that does exactly that in JACK2 and concentrate better on "core JACK" which is basically: client/server communications, graph management and scheduling, interactions with backends...etc...

I plan to release 1.9.8 quite soon (since it has a lot of new stuff and some important bug fixes and improvements). Then make concrete proposal in this direction.
