&gt; Not exactly: JACK1 still does compile on OSX, but all OS specific stuff (CoreAudio/CoreMIDI) have not been ported for a while.... The JackOSX package is based on JACK2 since early 2008....

Not exactly :)

Jack1 runs fine on OS X, with the limitation that it is using an older
version of the coreaudio driver (which implies some issues,
particularly on newer versions of OS X) and has no coremidi support.
It also doesn't come with JackRouter or JackPilot, two very useful
components that make JackOSX what it is. There's nothing inherently
wrong with Jack1 OSX, but as Stephane notes, nobody has really
bothered to keep it up to date with all the work he has done on the
CoreAudio backend in Jack2 over several years.

I continue to use Jack1 when developing Ardour on OS X, and I use it
for linking Ardour when building bundles of Ardour for OS X because it
avoids using the framework structure that Jack2 provides. There's
probably no good reason for this, when I'm likely the only person
still running Jack1 on OS X, but in theory it means that other people
could also make that choice. If I linked against Jack2, the use of
Jack1 would be ruled out.
