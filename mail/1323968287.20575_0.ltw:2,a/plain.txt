User here (albeit with a technical background).
I am still learning JACK and Linux-based audio, but I can think of a few cases where it seems cross-platform Jack would be helpful, especially if I start orchestrating something large and get two computers involved.  The net applications also seem to have obvious benefits.

As a Jack user on Linux, OS-X and Windows, I want to thank the Jack2
evelopers for their cross-platform support. My main audio usage is
irtual pipe organ applications - and being able to build Fluidsynth
or Windows with Jack for Windows native support is a major
reakthrough for jOrgan users on the Windows platform... There will
ikely be native Jack for Windows support in a couple of other Windows
udio apps in the next six months.
Waste of time? No way. Jack's user base is growing on the Windows platform...
