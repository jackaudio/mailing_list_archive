&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; You yourself suggested in your original post that Jack's development
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be driven by user requirements. Now ask yourself who are your
&gt; &gt; &gt; users. I bet they are 90% Linux. And those have no interest at all
&gt; &gt; &gt; in any Windows/xxx/yyy version. Go for it if you have spare capacity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or make it a GSOC project. But don't waste any time on it otherwise.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Even it that hurts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; JACK *already* runs on Windows. Stephane took care of this.
&gt; 
&gt; Jack2 runs on Windows. Jack1 doesn't. And it seems rather clear
&gt; that you don't see the Jack2 code as a basis for the future. If
&gt; you would then the 'Berlin path' should have been taken years
&gt; ago and it wasn't. Given that
&gt; 
&gt; * you and Torben don't see Jack2 as the future basis,

i am out.
so my view is probably irrelevant now.


&gt; * Grame has no good reason to abandon Jack2 for an 
&gt;   alternative C++ version,
&gt; 
&gt; it seems that you are condamned to either
&gt; 
&gt; 1. change your ideas about the Jack2 code base and abandon
&gt;    Jack1 (unlikely),
&gt; 2. or go on with Jack1 as it is,
&gt; 3. or create a C++ version separate from the Grame one,
&gt;    starting either from zero or from the Jack1 code base.
&gt; 
&gt; In cases 2 and 3, you don't have Windows support, and my point is
&gt; that you shouldn't waste time on it until at least the current
&gt; crisis has ended and the existing problems on *Linux* (such as
&gt; distros being driven to force one or the other version on users)
&gt; have been solved. That is just a matter of defining priorities.

whats the point with (2) ?
if we dont merge the tschack engines core, we dont have SMP support.
until this actually happens, there is no real reason, to continue
messing with jack1. 
however... i dont see this happening,
because i dont see paul maintaining the tschack engine on his own.

(3) is too far away... still dont see any people taking it.
