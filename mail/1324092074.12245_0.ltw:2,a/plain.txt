i am out.
so my view is probably irrelevant now.

whats the point with (2) ?
if we dont merge the tschack engines core, we dont have SMP support.
until this actually happens, there is no real reason, to continue
messing with jack1. 
however... i dont see this happening,
because i dont see paul maintaining the tschack engine on his own.

(3) is too far away... still dont see any people taking it.
