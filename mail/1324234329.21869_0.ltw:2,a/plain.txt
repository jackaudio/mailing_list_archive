Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Can't bring F/P below 128

I was using a very old (bought it around 2005) and very cheap (20 bucks 
back then) Soundblaster Live 24-bit PCI.  That card uses a CA0106 chip, 
which - according to many people - isn't that great.  And that sounds 
kind of accurate, considering the card's age and price (it was the 
cheapest card I could find back then; I had a mainboard without on-board 
sound and needed a quick solution.)

However, in JACK (using JACK2 now), I could use an F/P setting of 64 
without suffering from XRUNs.  The card still worked with a setting of 
32 or even 16, meaning it produced correct sound even with these 
super-low F/P settings, but the XRUNs resulted in many pops and crackles 
during playback.  But 64 F/P at 48kHz (translating to 2.67ms latency) 
was very comfortable to work with, so I didn't really need 32 or 16 F/P.

I recently got a new mainboard (since I upgraded from an older Core 2 
Duo CPU to an i5 2500K), which came with a recent on-board sound chip, 
an ALC892 from Realtek.  So after reading how on-board chips "have come 
a long way" since 2005, I switched to that one.  However, it's 
impossible to use 64 F/P on it.  I'm stuck at 128 with a 5.33ms latency 
:-/  It's not like I get too many XRUNs at 64 and lower, but rather I 
can't get anything else than just a static buzz noise.  Why is that? 
Can I do something about it?  It sound kind of strange to me that I can 
do that without problems on the cheapest hardware available 8 years ago 
(or 9? the CA0106 is really old) but not on hardware produced not even a 
year ago.

In case it matters, I'm using kernel 3.1.5.
