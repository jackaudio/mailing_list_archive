I've been avoiding this thread... *sigh*....  It wasn't quite the 
free-for-all I feared, though. :-)

&gt; I do have a proposal for how this is going to stop, but before I put

&gt; that point).

I've seen your proposal, and it's good.  However, here's a different idea...

The idea of JACK as a UNIX-ey IPC like grep/awk/sed is an impossible 
dream.  (But, it's a beautiful dream!)  I, personally, have abandoned 
this dream and now worship at the church of everything-is-a-plugin. :-)

One reason that it's impossible is that we discovered that we *don't* 
need jackd to be "do one thing and do it well."  We found that we need 
jackd to be a centralising, unifying, ubiquitous, overwhelming force for 
audio setups (for both desktop and specialised uses).  It's no longer a 
cool RT IPC between two apps, it's now also a session manager, transport 
master, sound card driver (for firewire), API, etc.  It bears much more 
resemblance to the Linux kernel than it does a character stream.

Suppose that the vision of JACK were re-cast.  Suppose it were stripped 
down to fit into a plugin-ey world:

IPC:

   * The IPC would become a specification for sharing
     audio and midi data in a RT-context.  No API, no
     network protocols.

   * If you must have a transport, specify the IPC and
     not the API.

API:

   * The jackd server becomes an API tool like the
     glib event loop.  The host application uses it
     as a tool to implement its internal audio logic.

   * The jackd kernel would be re-cast/optimised for
     parallel processing.

   * Things like the transport, session management,
     etc. would be left to the host and/or plugin
     API to deal with.

   * Would provide a reference API for utilizing the
     IPC above.

   * Port management is the domain of the plugin API.

   * Consider dropping or forking the specialized
     driver support.  (However, this may be
     unreasonable.)

   * Consider having a plugin framework for extending
     the JACK API.  (But this may be better left to
     the plugin API.

   * Prefer the LV2 plugin API.

AND AS FOR PLUGINS:

   * Do one thing and do it really well... :-)
