The interesting part is the HDA controller (part of the chipset).

It's likely that the HDA controller uses a larger burst size to save
power, and that it is too large for this small a period size.  If I've
read the Intel documentation correctly, is uses packets of at most
128 *bytes*, so in theory, it should work.  However, it might be
worthwhile to try reducing it.  Please try the patch below.
