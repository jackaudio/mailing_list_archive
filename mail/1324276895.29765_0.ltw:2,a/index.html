&gt; jackd doesn't have much to do with "your average Linux multimedia
&gt; desktop". neither does f/p below 128.

I disagree.  A multimedia desktop should be able to achieve this.  For 
example people using FL-Studio (former Fruity Loops) on Windows expect 
to be able to do that (with something like ASIO4all if their card 
doesn't have proper ASIO drivers.)

People expect to be able to play notes on their MIDI keyboard without 
audio delays on their non-specialized computers.

Also, as I pointed out in an older post, I am able to use 64 f/p just 
fine with another sound card and *without* an RT kernel.

If I wanted something like 16 f/p or similar, then yes, I would agree 
with you.


&gt;&gt; Or of course I could be extracting the wrong information from articles
&gt;&gt; like these:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; http://schivmeister.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/linux-audio-to-rt-or-to-bfs
&gt;
&gt; that article is similarly misleading, yes.
&gt;
&gt; in fact, i would estimate that at least 60% of what you will find
&gt; online about linux, RT and audio is misleading and/or false.

I believe the RT people ought to explain this then in:

https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/articles/f/r/e/Frequently_Asked_Questions_7407.html

The word "audio" (or "sound") is not even mentioned *once* on that page :-/
