Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Problem with Jack-Brutefir-Atom board

Hello

I'm trying to set-up a music server based on MPD, Jack1 and Brutefir. The 
project is based on a fanless ATOM board (D525 proc). Everything seems to work 
ok, except when the music server stops ("mpc stop" for ex.). After a little 
time, errors ocurr, like:

 1- $ pp: cannot clean up byte from graph wait fd (Resource temporarily 
unavailable) 
 2- $ bad status (-2) for client mpd_jack handling event (type = 5) 
 3- $ subgraph starting at brutefir timed out (subgraph_wait_fd=9, status = 0, 
state = Finished, pollret = 0 revents = 0x0)

I've tried with different distros (gentoo and debian) and doesn't solve the 
problem. But doing the same set-up in different computers, this problem only 
happens when the processor is an Atom.

Any idea what's happening?
