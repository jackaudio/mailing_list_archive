I can chime in here. I used this setting (8 frames per period at 48000hz 
sampling rate) regularly with my Delta 66 and -rt kernels pretty early 
after the initial release of this patchset by Ingo. Lately my use has 
changed to not require really low latency settings, but given good audio 
hardware I can only assume that this should be definitely still be 
achievable with a properly tuned -rt system..
