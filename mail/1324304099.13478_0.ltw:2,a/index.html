&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; jackd doesn't have much to do with "your average Linux multimedia
&gt;&gt;&gt; desktop". neither does f/p below 128.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I disagree.  A multimedia desktop should be able to achieve this.  For
&gt;&gt; example people using FL-Studio (former Fruity Loops) on Windows expect to be
&gt;&gt; able to do that (with something like ASIO4all if their card doesn't have
&gt;&gt; proper ASIO drivers.)
&gt;
&gt; 1) "desktop multimedia" != "specialized music creation applications"

Not specialized.  Simple stuff, like hooking up a MIDI keyboard to your 
average FL-clone (I use LMMS on Linux, which is a wannabe FL clone.)


&gt;&gt; People expect to be able to play notes on their MIDI keyboard without audio
&gt;&gt; delays on their non-specialized computers.
&gt;
&gt; people expect a lot of different things. that doesn't make their
&gt; expectations correct.

What are we arguing about here exactly?  My point was that an RT kernel 
might have some negative effects on average desktop systems, affecting 
performance and throughput.  I've lost the ball by now :-P  Are you 
saying that pretty much everyone should be using an RT kernel?  Or that 
I should be rebooting to an RT kernel when I need to work with audio?

If yes, then I disagree.  I think you can have both a stellar desktop 
performance *and* low latencies with the same kernel (which is the case 
with BFS.)  But my issue is not a matter of vanilla kernel vs RT vs BFS. 
  It's about the on-board sound chip being quite lame latency-wise, 
while a cheap-ass, ancient PCI card I have lying around unexpectedly 
turns out to be quite the low-latency monster.
