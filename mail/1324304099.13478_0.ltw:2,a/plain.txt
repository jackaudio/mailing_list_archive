Not specialized.  Simple stuff, like hooking up a MIDI keyboard to your 
average FL-clone (I use LMMS on Linux, which is a wannabe FL clone.)

What are we arguing about here exactly?  My point was that an RT kernel 
might have some negative effects on average desktop systems, affecting 
performance and throughput.  I've lost the ball by now :-P  Are you 
saying that pretty much everyone should be using an RT kernel?  Or that 
I should be rebooting to an RT kernel when I need to work with audio?

If yes, then I disagree.  I think you can have both a stellar desktop 
performance *and* low latencies with the same kernel (which is the case 
with BFS.)  But my issue is not a matter of vanilla kernel vs RT vs BFS. 
  It's about the on-board sound chip being quite lame latency-wise, 
while a cheap-ass, ancient PCI card I have lying around unexpectedly 
turns out to be quite the low-latency monster.
