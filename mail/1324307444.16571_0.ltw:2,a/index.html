Amen.

&gt; What are we arguing about here exactly?  My point was that an RT kernel
&gt; might have some negative effects on average desktop systems, affecting
&gt; performance and throughput. 

It not only /might/. It does. The reliability of RT kernel comes with
drawbacks. There certainly is additional overhead. `man cyclictest`..
run it.

You're BFS or vanilla kernel will both have a lower minimum latency as
well as a higher maxium latency compared to RT-linux.

&gt; I've lost the ball by now :-P  Are you
&gt; saying that pretty much everyone should be using an RT kernel?  Or that
&gt; I should be rebooting to an RT kernel when I need to work with audio?

You should use (or reboot into) RT when you require absolute certainty
(Well, nothing can prevent hardware failure or PEBKAC): i.e. If you're
performing on stage or run an [expensive] recording-session.

&gt; If yes, then I disagree.  I think you can have both a stellar desktop
&gt; performance *and* low latencies with the same kernel (which is the case
&gt; with BFS.)  

You can have stellar performance, but not reliability.

I tend to agree that for a /pro-sumer/ who occasionally connects her
MIDI keyboard to the PC at home, PREEMT_RT is overkill. She'll probably
be less annoyed by a handful of x-runs compared to occasional desktop
delays.

&gt; But my issue is not a matter of vanilla kernel vs RT vs BFS.
&gt;  It's about the on-board sound chip being quite lame latency-wise, while
&gt; a cheap-ass, ancient PCI card I have lying around unexpectedly turns out
&gt; to be quite the low-latency monster.

Are you really surprised by that?

The evolution of hardware in recent years has mainly been in the
Marketing and P&amp;R department. In general, the quality -esp. onboard
devices- is going to the dogs.
