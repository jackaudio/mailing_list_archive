Amen.

It not only /might/. It does. The reliability of RT kernel comes with
drawbacks. There certainly is additional overhead. `man cyclictest`..
run it.

You're BFS or vanilla kernel will both have a lower minimum latency as
well as a higher maxium latency compared to RT-linux.

You should use (or reboot into) RT when you require absolute certainty
(Well, nothing can prevent hardware failure or PEBKAC): i.e. If you're
performing on stage or run an [expensive] recording-session.

You can have stellar performance, but not reliability.

I tend to agree that for a /pro-sumer/ who occasionally connects her
MIDI keyboard to the PC at home, PREEMT_RT is overkill. She'll probably
be less annoyed by a handful of x-runs compared to occasional desktop
delays.

Are you really surprised by that?

The evolution of hardware in recent years has mainly been in the
Marketing and P&R department. In general, the quality -esp. onboard
devices- is going to the dogs.
