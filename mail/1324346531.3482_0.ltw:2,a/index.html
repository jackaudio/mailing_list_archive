(New subscriber, so apologies in advance if I'm in the wrong
place, etc...)

In setting up a zero-client arrangement, I have some functions
working with NetJACK, but mplayer and firefox/flash don't play
well, so far.  I have jackd running with real-time scheduling and
memory locking on both sides, as evidenced by this from
/proc/`pidof jackd`/limits on each side:

    Limit                     Soft Limit           Hard Limit           Units
    ...
    Max locked memory         512000000            512000000            bytes
    ...
    Max nice priority         25                   25                   
    Max realtime priority     90                   90                   
    ...

The physical network between the two machines is an isolated
gigabit ethernet (second NIC of server/slave machine) with only
an ethernet switch between them.  Per "vnstat -l -i eth1", only
~4Mbit/s of the available 1Gbit/s is being used.

I have the server/slave account's .asoundrc set up to default to
going through the JACK plugin:

    pcm.rawjack {
        type jack
        playback_ports {
            0 system:playback_1
            1 system:playback_2
        }
        capture_ports {
            0 system:capture_1
            1 system:capture_2
        }
    }

    pcm.jackplug {
        type plug
        slave { pcm "rawjack" }
    }

    pcm.!default {
        type plug
        slave { pcm "rawjack" }
    }

The client (JACK master) is set up to route its sound to both the
HDMI monitor and the line-out/headphone jacks, and that works
well with ALSA's speaker-test when run without NetJACK.

Running aplay on the server/slave works perfectly.

When I run mplayer on the server/slave, it plays perfectly for
8.9 seconds and then the sound changes to something similar to a
motorboat, and the server/slave jackd reports a ton of XRUNs.
After two control-Cs, mplayer quits, and NetJACK is happy again.
I get the same results with an input MP3 file at 22050sps mono
and a 44100sps stero WAV file.

Firefox (with probably a flash video) does not get any sound
through.  Instead, I get this from the server/slave jackd:

    jack_client_new: deprecated
    Jack: JackClient::SetupDriverSync driver sem in flush mode
    Jack: JackPosixSemaphore::Connect jack_sem.1501_default_alsa-jack.rawjackP.18755
    .0
    Jack: Already connected name = alsa-jack.rawjackP.18755.0
    Jack: Clock source : system clock via clock_gettime
    Jack: JackLibClient::Open name = alsa-jack.rawjackP.18755.0 refnum = 2
    Jack: JackClient::PortRegister ref = 2 name = alsa-jack.rawjackP.18755.0:out_000
     type = 32 bit float mono audio port_index = 5
    Jack: JackClient::PortRegister ref = 2 name = alsa-jack.rawjackP.18755.0:out_001
     type = 32 bit float mono audio port_index = 6
    Jack: JackClient::Activate
    Jack: JackClient::StartThread : period = -2147483648 computation = 21333 constra
    int = 500
    Jack: Create non RT thread
    Jack: ThreadHandler: start
    Jack: JackClient::kActivateClient name = alsa-jack.rawjackP.18755.0 ref = 2 
    Jack: JackClient::Connect src =  dst = system:playback_1
    cannot connect  to system:playback_1
    Jack: JackClient::Activate
    Jack: JackClient::Connect src =  dst = system:playback_1
    cannot connect  to system:playback_1
    Jack: JackClient::Activate
    Jack: JackClient::Connect src =  dst = system:playback_1
    cannot connect  to system:playback_1
    Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 5 is released state
    Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 6 is released state
    Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 5 is released state
    Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 6 is released state
    ...

The last pairs of lines repeat forever.  In this case, it looks
like 'src' is set to the empty string, but I have no idea what is
doing that.

Server/slave OS is 64-bit Mageia 1.  Firefox is 32-bit version
3.6.24.  Assuming it's a flash video, my flash player appears to
be 10.3.r181.  mplayer is version 1.0-1.rc4.0.r32713.5.1.mga1.
Server/slave JACK is jackit-1.9.6-1.mga1.  Client/master OS is a
remastered TinyCore Linux 4.0.2 with JACK version 1.9.7.  In case
hardware is relevant, the server/slave is a Xeon 3680 (6-core,
3.3GHz), and the client/master is an i3 540 (2-core, 3.06GHz).

Any suggestions for the mplayer motorboat symptom or the firefox
symptom?

Thanks in advance.
