Sounds like an X terminal kind of setup.

I took that to be a setup where the client was very lightweight, and all
the apps were running on a remote server but displayed on the client. JACK
master would run on the display, and JACK running net backend would run on
the server where the applications were running.
You know these young ones are always coming up with new terms for
reinventing X terminals.
