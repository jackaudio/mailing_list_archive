Thanks.  I'll have to remember "young ones" next time I receive
yet another AARP invitation.  :-)

Yes, zero-client is essentially an X terminal--plus sound, remote
USB, etc.  JACK master runs on the display.  JACK slave with the
'net' backend runs on the server where the applications run.  I
can run aplay (on the server, aka JACK slave) perfectly as far as
I can tell.  However, with mplayer, at 8.9 seconds into a file,
the sound becomes akin to a motorboat, and the JACK master
reports rapid-fire XRUNs.  Firefox, probably playing flash, never
produces audio.

Regarding the error messages I see with Firefox and flash, I
mis-wrote in the original posting.  It's stdout/stderr from
Firefox where I see this:

jack_client_new: deprecated
Jack: JackClient::SetupDriverSync driver sem in flush mode
Jack: JackPosixSemaphore::Connect jack_sem.1501_default_alsa-jack.rawjackP.3061.

Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 6 is released state
Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 5 is released state
Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 6 is released state
...

The last pairs of lines repeat at high speed forever.  It appears
to my untrained eye that 'src' is set to the empty string, which
would seem to be potentially significant.

At the moment, my uneducated guess is I need some "ctl" entries
in the server's .asoundrc.  Currently, it has this:

pcm.rawjack {
    type jack
    playback_ports {
        0 system:playback_1
        1 system:playback_2
    }
    capture_ports {
        0 system:capture_1
        1 system:capture_2
    }
}

pcm.jackplug {
    type plug
    slave { pcm "rawjack" }
}

pcm.!default {
    type plug
    slave { pcm "rawjack" }
}

However, that's essentially what I believe I have seen in
documentation, with no 'ctl' entries.

Suggestions?

Thanks,

Robert
