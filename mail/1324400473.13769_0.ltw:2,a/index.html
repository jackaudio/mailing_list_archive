&gt;&gt;&gt; why are you using netjack rather than just playing directly from

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sounds like an X terminal kind of setup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In setting up a zero-client arrangement
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I took that to be a setup where the client was very lightweight, and all
&gt;&gt; the apps were running on a remote server but displayed on the client. JACK
&gt;&gt; master would run on the display, and JACK running net backend would run on
&gt;&gt; the server where the applications were running.
&gt;&gt; You know these young ones are always coming up with new terms for
&gt;&gt; reinventing X terminals.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.  I'll have to remember "young ones" next time I receive
&gt; yet another AARP invitation.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, zero-client is essentially an X terminal--plus sound, remote
&gt; USB, etc.  JACK master runs on the display.  JACK slave with the
&gt; 'net' backend runs on the server where the applications run.  I
&gt; can run aplay (on the server, aka JACK slave) perfectly as far as
&gt; I can tell.  However, with mplayer, at 8.9 seconds into a file,
&gt; the sound becomes akin to a motorboat, and the JACK master
&gt; reports rapid-fire XRUNs.  Firefox, probably playing flash, never
&gt; produces audio.
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the error messages I see with Firefox and flash, I
&gt; mis-wrote in the original posting.  It's stdout/stderr from
&gt; Firefox where I see this:
&gt; 
&gt; jack_client_new: deprecated
&gt; Jack: JackClient::SetupDriverSync driver sem in flush mode
&gt; Jack: JackPosixSemaphore::Connect jack_sem.1501_default_alsa-jack.rawjackP.3061.

&gt; Jack: Already connected name = alsa-jack.rawjackP.3061.0
&gt; Jack: Clock source : system clock via clock_gettime

&gt; Jack: JackClient::Connect src =  dst = system:playback_1
&gt; Jack: JackClient::Connect src =  dst = system:playback_2
&gt; Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 5 is released state
&gt; Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 6 is released state
&gt; Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 5 is released state
&gt; Jack: JackGraphManager::GetBuffer : port = 6 is released state
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; The last pairs of lines repeat at high speed forever.  It appears
&gt; to my untrained eye that 'src' is set to the empty string, which
&gt; would seem to be potentially significant.
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment, my uneducated guess is I need some "ctl" entries
&gt; in the server's .asoundrc.  Currently, it has this:
&gt; 
&gt; pcm.rawjack {
&gt;     type jack
&gt;     playback_ports {
&gt;         0 system:playback_1
&gt;         1 system:playback_2
&gt;     }
&gt;     capture_ports {
&gt;         0 system:capture_1
&gt;         1 system:capture_2
&gt;     }
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; pcm.jackplug {
&gt;     type plug
&gt;     slave { pcm "rawjack" }
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; pcm.!default {
&gt;     type plug
&gt;     slave { pcm "rawjack" }
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; However, that's essentially what I believe I have seen in
&gt; documentation, with no 'ctl' entries.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions?

I never managed to get a satisfactory system with alsa-jack, jack plug,
and variants. No matter what, at least one client (skype, flash,
ekiga,..) always failed. Torben's patch
http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2010/10/0504.html was closest.


http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge

just works, and I have not looked back.

Well, it's a tiny bit more CPU intense (alsa_out, alsa_in are running
all the time) and it has one quirk: I need to kill/restarted those on
each suspend/resume cycle (done in /etc/pm/sleep.d/) leaving them
connected would otherwise freeze jackd on resume.

ciao,
