I never managed to get a satisfactory system with alsa-jack, jack plug,
and variants. No matter what, at least one client (skype, flash,
ekiga,..) always failed. Torben's patch
http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2010/10/0504.html was closest.


http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge

just works, and I have not looked back.

Well, it's a tiny bit more CPU intense (alsa_out, alsa_in are running
all the time) and it has one quirk: I need to kill/restarted those on
each suspend/resume cycle (done in /etc/pm/sleep.d/) leaving them
connected would otherwise freeze jackd on resume.

ciao,
