Which still leaves the question why things don't just work
with the alsa->jack plugin. 

For one, it doesn't show up in aplay -L or -l. Which probably
means some apps won't ever use it (anything based on juce for
example).

OTOH, when I plug in my Edirol USB interface, aplay -L shows
surround40,41,50,51 devices based on it which is plain nonsense
as the interface hase just two channels.

All of this just doesn't make any sense to me.
