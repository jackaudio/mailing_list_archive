If I may offer a follow-up thought, a major portion of Microsoft's market share strategy is to ensure easy migration when people or businesses with non-Microsoft applications, databases, etc., move to Microsoft applications.  While I wouldn't say that we ought to do something (or anything) just because Microsoft does it, any strategy that makes migration more palitable to an end user without violating the open source ethic should probably at least be considered.

Just an point of view from a Linuxaudio user...:
I do think, like others do, that JACK on Windows and OSX is beneficial 
or Linux audio *users* or better *musicians*. Especially the fact that 
ou can use Windows software via netjack gives people more (and 
ometimes strict necessary) possibilities for their workflow. We all 
now that Linux lacks some type of applications in certain areas, then 
t's nice when you have possibilities like netjack.
Moreover but less important probably, it makes Linux more attractive for 
sers who currently use Windows or OSX, when they are able to keep using 
ome Windows software which they think is needed or they spent a lot of 
oney for, they would make the switch to Linux more easily. I do also 
gree with the suggestion of Paul in which he says that a working JACK 
n Windows, makes it more likely that others developers (on other 
latforms) adapt JACK for their software, which we could benefit from.
It must be said that the good thing about the JACK2 developers is that 
hey are the ones who spent the most effort into a working (net)JACK on 
SX and Windows in contrary to the JACK1 developers (a bit black and 
hite view, but alas ;) ). We certainly don't want to loose that.
To me it seems that the JACK1 developers can't live with the current 
ACK2 as base for further development, that's why they are doing this 
roposal. JACK2 developers seems to be less strict to a certain coding 
tyle, it's obvious that they can live with the JACK2 base (and didn't 
o the proposal). They probably have nothing against a new JACK base, 
ut they are hesitate to spent a lot of time and effort in it and they 
ight doubt whether some of the good things about JACK2 will be wasted, 
hich is understandable from their point of view. They probably also 
oubt whether a combined contribution to one shared base will work out 
n practise. Are both teams able to cooperate well with each other? Are 
he JACK2 devs willing to work from a new base, under what conditions 
nd how many do they want to contribute to (building up) the new base? 
ow many contributions do the JACK1 devs 'demand' from JACK2 devs, 
efore they're willing to start working on a new base?
All though it is an option of course to take JACK2 as base, but the 
ption to have JACK2 as only base without contributions from the JACK1 
evelopers (as suggested in one of the previous emails) is not typically 
 win-win situation in my opinion, quite the contrary... (!)
The advantages for one shared base for JACK seems obvious to me. For the 
AU community (users, distros) it would be better to have one strong 
ACK and make the Linuxaudio situation as less complex as possible. 
onsidering the fact that their aren't that many active JACK developers, 
 can imagine that for the JACK-dev community it's an advantage when the 
cares number of developers work together on one JACK. It could safe 
ork and time, while the quality improves.
As a Linux audio user | musician, I hope both teams will be able to make 
 good plan for constructive cooperation, with respect to each others 
ork (and (coding) culture). Publish the plan and the conditions both 
eams can agree with, avoid as much possibilities for misunderstanding 
nd vagueness as possible, cause maybe it's more a social challenge then 
 coding challenge at the end.
All the best!
