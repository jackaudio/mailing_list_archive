i was working earlier this year on another ALSA PCM plugin that took
PCM data and pushed into shared memory. it had as "clients" a variety
of windows applications using a variety of windows audio APIs. even
without the additional complication of supporting multiple processes
(no, you can't use dmix as part of a PCM plugin :((( ), it was
nightmarish enough that eventually things just got sort of abandoned.
but read on below ...

it doesn't need to be fixed. ALSA and OSS are the problems. by
allowing applications to be coded with such a variety of cobbled
together solutions, it becomes a huge task to write any kind of plugin
that can tolerate all their behaviours. this is, of course one of the
central problems facing pulseaudio. PA *has* gotten fairly close to
providing a plugin (i.e. a software device driver) that works for
*almost* all clients *almost* all of the time. but yes, not all
clients and not all the time.
