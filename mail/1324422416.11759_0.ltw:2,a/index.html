&gt; Do you really think that this is interesting and important?

Yes. _Why_ can't we just have something that looks like an
ALSA hw device on one end (so apps can see it and use it),
and a Jack client at the other end ?

&gt; Why don't you have a look?

If I would charge the hours spent 'having a look' and you would
be so good as to pay that bill, then probably your next action
would have to be go looking for a nice bridge to sleep under :-)

&gt; I assume that it's due to the multitude of possible ways that clients
&gt; can interact with ALSA: some push, some pull, some request specific
&gt; buffer-sizes and/or bit-depth,... others use weird workarounds for
&gt; internal [timing] issues: In particular closed source apps like flash,
&gt; skype..

Returning to my question above, there is no logical problem
with such a thing. Every ALSA hw device, once configured for
a particular sample rate, imposes that sample rate on its
client. It doesn't matter if the client 'pulls' or 'pushes',
if it uses read/write or mmap - these are just interface
details. The client has to produce/accept samples at the
rate determined by the the device, no matter how it talks
to that device.

So an ALSA *device* (as opposed to a plugin) that takes its
timing from Jack's process callback instead of from a sound
card interrupt should just be possible. It would amount to
1/2 aloop + a Jack client + something. It could even be 100%
userspace. 

But the fact that after all those years such a thing does not
exist makes me think that there is some fundamental problem
with ALSA that makes it impossible. And after lots of hours
trying to penetrate ALSA's endless layers of syntactic sugar,
indirections, and abstractions for abstraction's sake I still
don't know what that fundamental problem is. I do know that
every time I try to go deeper into it the frustration grows.

&gt; &gt; For one, it doesn't show up in aplay -L or -l. Which probably
&gt; &gt; means some apps won't ever use it (anything based on juce for
&gt; &gt; example).
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, they're created dynamically.

And that is a fundamental mistake. If it shouldn't matter to an
app if it is using a real HW card or a ALSA plugin such as dmix
etc., then the plugins should just look as if they were HW devices
and be discoverable in the same way.
