Indeed. Even ALSA's own official plugings (dmix and co) fail
to provide the 'full' ALSA interface. Try to run Jack on top
of one of those. It should all be just transparent, the docs
and marketing blurb suggest it is, but in reality it isn't.

Simple fact is that once you have an 'mmap' style API in
userspace all the others can be created easily on top of
that by a client-side library. So ALSA shouldn't try and
provide all those variations, it should just have provided
such a library. Same for resampling, format conversions etc.
The only thing that ALSA should have provided natively is
multi-client access.
