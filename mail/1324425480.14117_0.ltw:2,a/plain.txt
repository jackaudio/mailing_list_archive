If you just add the outputs from all client without any scaling
then there is no 'policy' involved, as the result that each
client gets does not depend on the presence of any other as long
as the sum doesn't exceed the physical limits. If it does, that
is the user's problem. Just as it is when e.g. windows from two
or more apps overlap on the screen. Or when two or more apps are
printing on the same xterm.
