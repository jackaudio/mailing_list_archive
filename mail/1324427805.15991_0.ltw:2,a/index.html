&gt;&gt; Do you really think that this is interesting and important?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. _Why_ can't we just have something that looks like an
&gt; ALSA hw device on one end (so apps can see it and use it),
&gt; and a Jack client at the other end ?

Isn't that a whole different thing? The b0rked alsa-jack plugin is a
alsa-lib plugin, not a "virtual hardware" device in /dev/...
which would be listed in `aplay -l` and cat /proc/asound/devices

I was thinking along the same lines when looking into re-sampling and
latency issues with the snd-aloop module. It'd need to be modified to
accept sth. like a word-clock on one of its I/O, so that it can be
properly synced to jack.

Fixing the existing alsa-plugin or providing this as alsa-plugin is not
an option: it'll never work for all situations and it's messy to begin
with.

A kernel-module however, can't be directly connected to JACK.

&gt;&gt; Why don't you have a look?
&gt; 
&gt; If I would charge the hours spent 'having a look' and you would
&gt; be so good as to pay that bill,

I was not interested to get this fixed in the first place. As I said:
I'm happy with the loopback solution.

&gt; then probably your next action
&gt; would have to be go looking for a nice bridge to sleep under :-)

At least there are some really nice bridges around here (-;
But you do scare me, you sound like you speak from experience.
Is that Takashi under the Pont d'Alsace-Jacques? :)


[..]
&gt; Returning to my question above, there is no logical problem
&gt; with such a thing. 
[..]
logical: no; but reality bites.

&gt; So an ALSA *device* (as opposed to a plugin) that takes its
&gt; timing from Jack's process callback instead of from a sound
&gt; card interrupt should just be possible. It would amount to
&gt; 1/2 aloop + a Jack client + something. 

1+

OTOH. Spending time on implementing this vs. spending time to jackify an
ALSA-only app. The latter is IMO much more appropriate (fi. the app will
inherit RT capabilities from jack, it's [at least] one layer less in in
between and potentially even zero-copy, it'll make jack more valuable,..).

The main use-case of a generic alsa&lt;&gt;jack virtual hardware interface is
web audio[/video] and 99.9% of those certainly can't get any worse by a
bit of resampling and do not need to be sample-accurate either. YMMV.

&gt; It could even be 100% userspace. 

Are you sure about that? How?
