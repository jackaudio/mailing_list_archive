My server (JACK slave) kernel (2.6.38.8-server-8.mga from Mageia
1) does have SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS set to 'y', so I experimented
with trying to create multiple loopback cards.  Despite modinfo
saying the module takes arrays for parameters, something like
this:

    modprobe snd_aloop index=2,3 id=fred2,fred3

only creates one loopback card with the first bank of parameter
values.  I tried several combinations of things, and not one of
them would create multiple loopback cards.  I even tried the
"modprobe -o somename ..." syntax to try to create differently
named modules, and that didn't work, either.

May I please beg one more suggestion?

Thanks,

Robert
