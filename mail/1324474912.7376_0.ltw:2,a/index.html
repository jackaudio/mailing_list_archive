&gt; Please rewind a few posts and read again. I never said it should be

OK, it sounded it lot like that, since you wrote:

&gt;that by a client-side library. So ALSA shouldn't try and
&gt;provide all those variations, it should just have provided
&gt;such a library. Same for resampling, format conversions etc.
&gt;The only thing that ALSA should have provided natively is
&gt;multi-client access.

I interpreted that to mean something other than what you did.

&gt; And what I have in mind is very close to what ALSA actually does,

Indeed. The dmix device actually does almost precisely what you
describe, and will appear in device listings *if* its configured in
the relevant system-wide or per-user ALSA config file. Two years ago,
most distributions shipped with dmix configured. With PulseAudio
spreading, and more powerful, they tend to no longer do so. I remember
Fedora at one point shipping with default=dmix, so that all audio
processes that just opened the default device got their audio mixed
(in user space, without a server). Note that there is also a
server/client based solution too - I don't think its been used much by
anyone.

But there's a second problem. Look at the output of aplay -L. Now
compare it to the list of devices shown by, say, qjackctl in its setup
dialog. You'll note that they are not the same. The real problem here
is not the gap between h/w device names and plugin device names. The
problem is that there are indeed two namespaces within ALSA, one that
references a card number, device number and possibly subdevice number,
the other than is an alias for either a plugin or something specified
using the first namespace. According to aplay, these two namespaces
consist of:

    -l, --list-devices      list all soundcards and digital audio devices
    -L, --list-pcms         list device names

So, having defined the "jack" plugin device, aplay -L will list it
just like "default" and "hdmi" and "front" and so forth. But you're
right that it doesn't show up in the other namespace, because its not
a "card". So I agree that you're completely correct when you say:

&gt; 3. ALSA doesn't present them in the same way as HW devices
&gt; &#xA0; (it tries to some extent) and consequenctly any app that
&gt; &#xA0; just scans for HW cards, (typically the closed source
&gt; &#xA0; things like Skype etc.) won't ever use them.

but that the real problem is that ALSA hasn't really said which
namespace applications are supposed to be using in the first place. By
the way, you *can* make Skype use them. My version of skype uses an
ALSA plugin to do "ringing" (not for the regular voice stream).

&gt; 4. They don't work as expected (try running Jack on plughw:x,y),

well, it depends on what "work as expected" means. plughw:x,y does
work with JACK, but how well depends on precisely what configuration
you ask for and how much it differs from the native capabilities of
hw:x,y

&gt; problem is that the Juce code chokes on 64-ch cards such as the
&gt; MADI ones. OK, just define a 'route' ALSA device (IIRC) with
&gt; less channels (it needs 8) or us the ALSA-&gt;Jack plugin. But that
&gt; doesn't work because ALSA doesn't present them as real devices.
&gt; By not doing that it misses the whole point of having such plugs
&gt; in the first place.

absolutely. but ALSA does present them as "real devices", just in one
of two namespaces and the app has no reason to choose the one in which
they appear. its pretty pathetic.

&gt; (1) can't be done if the sound card is supposed to be shared
&gt; between different apps. Selecting the sample rate, format etc.
&gt; should done by the a configuration utility. After that apps are
&gt; supposed to use the sound card as it is.

this is the way pro-audio apps work on many platforms (not all - try
digital performer sometime on OS X with the h/w running at a different
rate from the DP session). its very far from how almost all desktop
apps work on most platforms.

&gt; 5. Separates HW configuration from actually using a soundcard.
&gt; In other words the API to be used by a normal client informs
&gt; the client of the current sample rate, format, buffers size
&gt; and whatever, but does not require or even allow the client
&gt; to set any of those. Same for the access model: only mmap,
&gt; and clients are supposed to run their audio code in RT. All
&gt; this is very similar to the restrictions that Jack imposes.

restrictions which ensure that JACK is not adopted by many
programmers, and because of the SNAFU'ed state of the rest of Linux,
make life complicated for users because RT access is considered
"special".

&gt; Clients that can't live with the restrictions of (5) link
&gt; with a library (part of the ALSA system) that provides sample
&gt; rate conversion, buffering, alternative access methods, and
&gt; whatever you can imagine in an easy way. This library replaces
&gt; all of dmix, dsnoop, route, etc.

you should read the code of libasound (the ALSA library). it does
precisely what you're describing (not necessarily optimally) but it
really does aspire to be precisely what you're describing.

&gt; All this would actually be simpler than what we have now.

I still don't understand how this all works without a server/client
architecture. Dmix tries to do this, and its too clever for its own
good (or that of users). The server/client nature of JACK and
PulseAudio is one of the things that makes them fragile (to whatever
extent they are fragile), and thus unloved by people negatively
impacted by this sort of architecture (and often unnecessarily).

OTOH, its interesting that OS X Lion now appears to have moved to this
design (server/client) too. "coreaudiod" now appears to a central
user-space funnelling point for all audio on that platform, whether
the app user or developer likes it or not. The server gets started by
the system (and restarted when it crashes, and it does crash).

I don't want to defend ALSA. Many aspects of its architecture are, in
retrospect, really wrong. But as with X, its also unfair to criticize
it without understanding how it really works or where the real
problems are.
