Would that not break a lot of existing ALSA apps?

Are you envisaging that this would be done transparently in alsa-lib, or
would the clients need to be updated?

You will need to take a leaf out of Lennart's book if you want to push
this through! :)

A pragmatic hack would be to patch the discovery of plugs and just make
them appear to be persistent hardware interfaces. Making the mess even
more messy is much simpler than cleaning up :)  The might even be
possible with alsa.conf and asoundrc without any code changes.

just saying,
