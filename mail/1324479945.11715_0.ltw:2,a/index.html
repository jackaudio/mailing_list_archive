&gt; Indeed. The dmix device actually does almost precisely what you

&gt; the relevant system-wide or per-user ALSA config file. Two years ago,
&gt; most distributions shipped with dmix configured. With PulseAudio
&gt; spreading, and more powerful, they tend to no longer do so. I remember
&gt; Fedora at one point shipping with default=dmix, so that all audio
&gt; processes that just opened the default device got their audio mixed
&gt; (in user space, without a server). Note that there is also a
&gt; server/client based solution too - I don't think its been used much by
&gt; anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; But there's a second problem. Look at the output of aplay -L. Now
&gt; compare it to the list of devices shown by, say, qjackctl in its setup
&gt; dialog. You'll note that they are not the same. The real problem here
&gt; is not the gap between h/w device names and plugin device names. The
&gt; problem is that there are indeed two namespaces within ALSA, one that
&gt; references a card number, device number and possibly subdevice number,
&gt; the other than is an alias for either a plugin or something specified
&gt; using the first namespace. According to aplay, these two namespaces
&gt; consist of:
&gt; 
&gt;     -l, --list-devices      list all soundcards and digital audio devices
&gt;     -L, --list-pcms         list device names
&gt; 
&gt; So, having defined the "jack" plugin device, aplay -L will list it
&gt; just like "default" and "hdmi" and "front" and so forth. But you're
&gt; right that it doesn't show up in the other namespace, because its not
&gt; a "card".

Now I'm lost. I do have a ~/.asoundrc

----

pcm.!default {
    type plug
    slave { pcm "jack" }
}

pcm.jack {
    type jack
    playback_ports {
        0 system:playback_3
        1 system:playback_4
    }
    capture_ports {
        0 system:capture_3
        1 system:capture_4
    }
}

and it works (mplayer, firefox, even alsaplayer use it).

But it does *not* show up in either aplay -L or -l. So is
there are third namespace as well ?

BTW, the two lines you quoted from aplay -h illustrate
another problem. Note the inconsistent use of terms like
'device', 'card' and 'pcm'. You end up wondering what each
of those actually means. And what the real difference
between -L and -l is supposed to be. It gets an order of
magnitude worse in most of the ALSA docs.


&gt; &gt; problem is that the Juce code chokes on 64-ch cards such as the
&gt; &gt; MADI ones. OK, just define a 'route' ALSA device (IIRC) with
&gt; &gt; less channels (it needs 8) or us the ALSA-&gt;Jack plugin. But that
&gt; &gt; doesn't work because ALSA doesn't present them as real devices.
&gt; &gt; By not doing that it misses the whole point of having such plugs
&gt; &gt; in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; absolutely. but ALSA does present them as "real devices", just in one
&gt; of two namespaces and the app has no reason to choose the one in which
&gt; they appear. its pretty pathetic.

Even more if you consider that the app is doing the right thing:
it provides a list of devices and allows the user to select one.
That is better than most ALSA apps. That list could have included
'!default', and in that case things would just work. But why should
an author add !default if he/she believes the list is complete,
and !default will be one of those listed anyway ?
 
&gt; &gt; (1) can't be done if the sound card is supposed to be shared
&gt; &gt; between different apps. Selecting the sample rate, format etc.
&gt; &gt; should done by the a configuration utility. After that apps are
&gt; &gt; supposed to use the sound card as it is.
&gt; 
&gt; this is the way pro-audio apps work on many platforms (not all - try
&gt; digital performer sometime on OS X with the h/w running at a different
&gt; rate from the DP session). its very far from how almost all desktop
&gt; apps work on most platforms.

See below.
 
&gt; restrictions which ensure that JACK is not adopted by many
&gt; programmers, and because of the SNAFU'ed state of the rest of Linux,
&gt; make life complicated for users because RT access is considered
&gt; "special".

Yes, but Jack could have offered form the start a library, working
on top of Jack's native interface, that provides resampling, read()
and write(), buffering to allow non-RT operation, etc. Basically
allowing the author to define his own private 'soundcard' with a
fully traditional API. Combine that with a jackd running as a real
system daemon and you get the most easy-to-use audio system on the
planet. Could still be done, but probably that space is taken by
PA today.
 
&gt; you should read the code of libasound (the ALSA library). it does
&gt; precisely what you're describing (not necessarily optimally) but it
&gt; really does aspire to be precisely what you're describing.

Believe me, I have. The last time just an hour ago. But AFAICS (and
please correct me if I'm missing something essential) it provides
all that only via the 'plugins', which the client apparently can't
discover in any standard way. In what I propose, the initiative to
use any conversions, buffering, etc. is taken by the client which
just specifies what it needs. This is fundamentally different from
offering predefined plugins which apart from being invisible will
also either be restrictive, or be forced to be 'too clever for their
own good'.
 
&gt; I still don't understand how this all works without a server/client
&gt; architecture. Dmix tries to do this, and its too clever for its own
&gt; good (or that of users). The server/client nature of JACK and
&gt; PulseAudio is one of the things that makes them fragile (to whatever
&gt; extent they are fragile), and thus unloved by people negatively
&gt; impacted by this sort of architecture (and often unnecessarily).

In what sense do you see a server/client architecture as fundamentally
different from e.g. open(), read(), write() etc. ? Just the fact that
there is an 'active' entity (a daemon) involved instead of only system
calls ? That should be transparent to the user. So I somehow fail to
see the point you want to make.
