&gt;&gt; Indeed. The dmix device actually does almost precisely what you
&gt;&gt; describe, and will appear in device listings *if* its configured in
&gt;&gt; the relevant system-wide or per-user ALSA config file. Two years ago,
&gt;&gt; most distributions shipped with dmix configured. With PulseAudio
&gt;&gt; spreading, and more powerful, they tend to no longer do so. I remember
&gt;&gt; Fedora at one point shipping with default=dmix, so that all audio
&gt;&gt; processes that just opened the default device got their audio mixed
&gt;&gt; (in user space, without a server). Note that there is also a
&gt;&gt; server/client based solution too - I don't think its been used much by
&gt;&gt; anyone.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But there's a second problem. Look at the output of aplay -L. Now
&gt;&gt; compare it to the list of devices shown by, say, qjackctl in its setup
&gt;&gt; dialog. You'll note that they are not the same. The real problem here
&gt;&gt; is not the gap between h/w device names and plugin device names. The
&gt;&gt; problem is that there are indeed two namespaces within ALSA, one that
&gt;&gt; references a card number, device number and possibly subdevice number,
&gt;&gt; the other than is an alias for either a plugin or something specified
&gt;&gt; using the first namespace. According to aplay, these two namespaces
&gt;&gt; consist of:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0; -l, --list-devices &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;list all soundcards and digital audio devices
&gt;&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0; -L, --list-pcms &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; list device names
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, having defined the "jack" plugin device, aplay -L will list it
&gt;&gt; just like "default" and "hdmi" and "front" and so forth. But you're
&gt;&gt; right that it doesn't show up in the other namespace, because its not
&gt;&gt; a "card".
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm lost. I do have a ~/.asoundrc
&gt;
&gt; ----
&gt;
&gt; pcm.!default {
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;type plug
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;slave { pcm "jack" }
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; pcm.jack {
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;type jack
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;playback_ports {
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;0 system:playback_3
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;1 system:playback_4
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;}
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;capture_ports {
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;0 system:capture_3
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;1 system:capture_4
&gt; &#xA0; &#xA0;}
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; ----
&gt;
&gt; and it works (mplayer, firefox, even alsaplayer use it).
&gt;
&gt; But it does *not* show up in either aplay -L or -l. So is
&gt; there are third namespace as well ?

% cat ~/.asoundrc

pcm.rawjack {
    type jack
    playback_ports {
        0 system:playback_1
        1 system:playback_2
    }
    capture_ports {
        0 system:capture_1
        1 system:capture_2
    }
}

pcm.jack {
    type plug
    slave { pcm "rawjack" }
    hint {
 	description "JACK Audio Connection Kit"
    }
}

% aplay -L
null
    Discard all samples (playback) or generate zero samples (capture)
jack
    JACK Audio Connection Kit
default:CARD=SB
    HDA ATI SB, VT2020 Analog
    Default Audio Device
front:CARD=SB,DEV=0
    HDA ATI SB, VT2020 Analog
    Front speakers
.....

&gt;&gt; restrictions which ensure that JACK is not adopted by many
&gt;&gt; programmers, and because of the SNAFU'ed state of the rest of Linux,
&gt;&gt; make life complicated for users because RT access is considered
&gt;&gt; "special".
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but Jack could have offered form the start a library, working
&gt; on top of Jack's native interface, that provides resampling, read()
&gt; and write(), buffering to allow non-RT operation, etc. Basically
&gt; allowing the author to define his own private 'soundcard' with a
&gt; fully traditional API.

such libraries have been written. at least 4 of them. none of them
were implemented well enough to work right, all the time, for
precisely the reasons robin originally alluded to: apps try to play
all kinds of silly games with platform audio APIs because of their
developers' beliefs that the APIs and/or drivers are broken or wrong.
sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong, but the result (as
libasound, pulse, oss2jack, alsa2jack, bio2jack and others have all
found) is that a variety of apps exhibit broken behaviour despite the
"wrapper library" doing its best to provide a conformant layer.

remember that lots of apps these days want timing information (video
sync etc) that goes ye old open/read/write/close model (or an mmap
variant). in fact, how to provide latency information is probably the
principle difference at this point between all the callback-driven
APIs across all platforms.

&gt; Believe me, I have. The last time just an hour ago. But AFAICS (and
&gt; please correct me if I'm missing something essential) it provides
&gt; all that only via the 'plugins', which the client apparently can't
&gt; discover in any standard way. In what I propose, the initiative to
&gt; use any conversions, buffering, etc. is taken by the client which
&gt; just specifies what it needs. This is fundamentally different from
&gt; offering predefined plugins which apart from being invisible will
&gt; also either be restrictive, or be forced to be 'too clever for their
&gt; own good'.

the idea in ALSA originally was that apps would open a default device
with properties much like "plughw:N" (that was the default
originally). the app would ask for whatever SR, bit depth, etc. that
it needed, and it would get it. then it would proceed whichever
part(s) of the ALSA PCM API that it needed, and it would not matter
one bit whether the parameters precisely matched the hardware or not.
this actually works quite well, except that the SRC is very cpu
expensive and of pretty poor quality, and if the number of channels is
left unspecified, the number is absurdly high. put another way, the
idea was that the PCM stream configuration API was identical to the
API for opening the hardware device and configuring it, which meant
that it didn't matter *what* the actual PCM stream was pointing at.
This was a smart move, even if the implementation is a bit inelegant.

the whole notion of "predefined plugins" really came much later, and
was intended as a shorthand for things like "tell appFoo to play this
sound, but over my rear speakers" or "tell appBar to send audio via a
LADSPA plugin with the following settings". the plugins in ~/.asoundrc
are absolutely not there to replace the ability that libasound (and
specifically plughw:N) exists for: the app opens a named device, asks
for a given configuration and gets it.

the problem was that the feature set required by people began to
exceed what libasound could reasonably do (at the time, anyway).
people wanted user-space mixing, network streaming, per-app volume
controls. the whole thing started to creak and so alternatives showed
up (i.e. PulseAudio).

&gt;&gt; I still don't understand how this all works without a server/client
&gt;&gt; architecture. Dmix tries to do this, and its too clever for its own
&gt;&gt; good (or that of users). The server/client nature of JACK and
&gt;&gt; PulseAudio is one of the things that makes them fragile (to whatever
&gt;&gt; extent they are fragile), and thus unloved by people negatively
&gt;&gt; impacted by this sort of architecture (and often unnecessarily).
&gt;
&gt; In what sense do you see a server/client architecture as fundamentally
&gt; different from e.g. open(), read(), write() etc. ? Just the fact that
&gt; there is an 'active' entity (a daemon) involved instead of only system
&gt; calls ? That should be transparent to the user. So I somehow fail to
&gt; see the point you want to make.

* the server has to be started, somehow
* the server has to continue running somehow
* all the bugs and properties of the server become part of the bugs
and properties of the apps

but that aside ...

libasound already has a server architecture that does user-space
mixing in precisely the way you are describing. apps just open a named
ALSA device, they use the regular ALSA API
(snd_pcm_open/snd_pcm_write/snd_pcm_read/snd_pcm_close etc), and their
stream is magically mixed into the streams of other apps using the
same named device.

but wait! there's more ... this is also PRECISELY how PulseAudio works
too! apps just open a named ALSA device (often "default" on many
distros), they use the regular ALSA API
(snd_pcm_open/snd_pcm_write/snd_pcm_read/snd_pcm_close etc), and their
stream is magically mixed into the streams of other apps using the
same named device.

and there's more ... these apps (at least the ones that don't try to
play games with the API) will work if told to open the hardware device
directly too! because its all the same open/read/write/close API ...

and yet, somehow, i don't think that you're tremendously thrilled
about what PulseAudio or ALSA own rarely-used server does .. why? i
think mostly because of something that is somehow related to
"transparency" ...
