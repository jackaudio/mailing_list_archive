Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] How to get mplayer and firefox/flash to play

Thanks for all the help so far in getting ALSA loopback
set up to use mplayer and firefox/flash with NetJACK.
I ran into another quirk, but I believe I know the
solution.  With one loopback soundcard created by
snd_aloop, and with one user having used it yesterday,
with no processes from the first user still existing,
when another user tried to start up a session, alsa_in
reports this:

ALSA lib pcm_dsnoop.c:578:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to create IPC semaphore
Capture open error: Permission denied

It would appear the solution is to set up per-user
loopback soundcards so that each user will own his/her
loopback soundcard instance.  It might also be possible
to rmmod and modprobe snd_aloop, but I don't want users
messing with kernel modules--and I may need to have
multiple users at the same time, which would require
separate loopback soundcards anyway.

Thanks again,

Robert
