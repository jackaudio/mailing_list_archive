Hello all,

I am having a bit trouble with alsa_in. Since jack can only handle one 
soundcard and most applications are only capable of using either alsa or 
jack, I am trying to use alsa_in for my USB Microphone (rather an 
olympus portable audio recorder which also can act as an USB microphone).
Now, the first Problem is, that alsa_in does create the jack port as 
desired, but also immediately sets the device to record mode - what will 
inspire you with new creative ways to use feedback quite intensively.

With pure alsa I have to press the record button of f.e audacity to 
ready the device for recording, it's not armed by default.

The other problem is, that alsa_in keeps crashing after quite a short while:

#/usr/bin/alsa_in -v -j olympus -d hw:6

res: 0.999492,  diff = 52.194611,       offset = 155.000000
res: 0.999389,  diff = 63.72zombified - calling shutdown handler
9683,   offset = 185.000000
res: 0.999186,  diff = 75.285690,       offset = 131.000000
&lt;snip&gt;
res: 1.000510,  diff = -59.687202,      offset = -55.000000
tail: /var/log/audio/alsaIn.log: file truncated
ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1401:(_snd_pcm_hw_open) Invalid value for card
Capture open error: No such file or directory

Any Ideas how I may improve? Currently the situation is a bit 
unpleasant, as I cannot really record anything from microphone, execpt 
when using audacity, which for most parts is one of the programs I like 
least. But its audio  input/output selection is top notch: Choose alsa 
or jack on the fly.

Ardour, qtracktor, muse, rosegarden, traverso (anything forgotten?) seem 
to handle jack only, but the  audio_in plugin is unstable and a hassle 
to use, as it's permanently armed (if not already chrashed) -  already 
when starting the application and before you can mute anything - 
depending on the behaviour application, of course.

As I am surely not the only one using an USB microphone, I wonder how 
you do handle this?
