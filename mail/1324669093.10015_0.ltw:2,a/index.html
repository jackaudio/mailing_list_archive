&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I am having a bit trouble with alsa_in. Since jack can only handle one
&gt; soundcard and most applications are only capable of using either alsa or
&gt; jack, I am trying to use alsa_in for my USB Microphone (rather an olympus
&gt; portable audio recorder which also can act as an USB microphone).
&gt; Now, the first Problem is, that alsa_in does create the jack port as
&gt; desired, but also immediately sets the device to record mode - what will
&gt; inspire you with new creative ways to use feedback quite intensively.
&gt;
&gt; With pure alsa I have to press the record button of f.e audacity to ready
&gt; the device for recording, it's not armed by default.

JACK runs continuously. Audacity opens and closes, opens and closes
devices. You need to get use to this idea, its absolutely fundamental
to how JACK works.

But there will be no feedback unless you create a feedback signal
path. The data from alsa_in isn't going anywhere on its own.

&gt; The other problem is, that alsa_in keeps crashing after quite a short while:

its not crashing. Its being shut down by JACK for being too slow OR
because its one of a number of clients that are too slow, and alsa_in
got picked as the one to shutdown.

&gt; Ardour, qtracktor, muse, rosegarden, traverso (anything forgotten?) seem to
&gt; handle jack only, but the &#xA0;audio_in plugin is unstable and a hassle to use,
&gt; as it's permanently armed

this is really misleading. nothing is armed: there is a data stream
arriving from the mic. nothing happens to that datastream unless you
route it somewhere that does something with it. it sounds as if you
have the signal routing inside the recording app set up inadvisably or
incorrectly.

&gt; As I am surely not the only one using an USB microphone, I wonder how you do
&gt; handle this?

did you read the introduction to:

   http://jackaudio.org/multiple_devices

(its in the FAQ)

if you're actually into audio, rather than just needing to a quick
podcast, you don't want to be doing this whole multi-device thing. if
you are just doing a quick podcast etc. stick with audacity - it will
serve you well.
