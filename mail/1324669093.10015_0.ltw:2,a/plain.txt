JACK runs continuously. Audacity opens and closes, opens and closes
devices. You need to get use to this idea, its absolutely fundamental
to how JACK works.

But there will be no feedback unless you create a feedback signal
path. The data from alsa_in isn't going anywhere on its own.

its not crashing. Its being shut down by JACK for being too slow OR
because its one of a number of clients that are too slow, and alsa_in
got picked as the one to shutdown.

this is really misleading. nothing is armed: there is a data stream
arriving from the mic. nothing happens to that datastream unless you
route it somewhere that does something with it. it sounds as if you
have the signal routing inside the recording app set up inadvisably or
incorrectly.

did you read the introduction to:

   http://jackaudio.org/multiple_devices

(its in the FAQ)

if you're actually into audio, rather than just needing to a quick
podcast, you don't want to be doing this whole multi-device thing. if
you are just doing a quick podcast etc. stick with audacity - it will
serve you well.
