&gt; this is really misleading. nothing is armed: there is a data stream
&gt; arriving from the mic. nothing happens to that datastream unless you
&gt; route it somewhere that does something with it. it sounds as if you
&gt; have the signal routing inside the recording app set up inadvisably or
&gt; incorrectly.


First of all, thanks for your reply. There is a datastream coming from 
the mic, that's why I've called it armed. Or in other words, it is in 
record mode, which however is triggered by the OS.

Very likely my feedback problem is related to the software, but since 
all linux apps behave quite strange, I was not sure wether it is by 
design or not.
At least it seems that by default, when using jack, all inports are 
directly routed to the outport - what explains the feedback.

This is not a matter of qjackctl, as the different application seem to 
do this automatically when adding an audiotrack. I can break a 
connection afterwards.

Still, this is without having set up anything yet - just starting up the 
application and add an audio track.

Normally I would expect that I can choose or will at least be asked 
which audio in I will assign to a certain track (muse kinda works this 
way), however, this is not the case with my tested applications. I just 
add a track and have the loop instantly.

Nevertheless, let that feedback be, this is not application support. I 
was just intrigued by the different behaviour to alsa, where alsa has a 
more practical approach in this very case.

More important anyway: Is there anything I could try about jack closing 
down the port every now and then? Maybe any recommended settings to 
alsa_in or jack that could be used as a sane starting point?

As my new system is not recognizing my Hammerfall for what reason ever, 
I currently have an USB Soundcard and occasionally the USB microphone, 
so my jack settings are a bit more relaxed, but I admit, I have not 
fully understood, what all those periods do.

Usually jack runs fine with following settings (not really low latency, 
but stable and currently ok as an intermediate solution):

/usr/bin/jackd --realtime --verbose -d alsa --device hw:4 --rate 44100 
--nperiods 4 --period 512 --duplex --hwmon --midi seq

Do I need to go down further with jack or rather tweak alsa_in? Latency 
is less of a concern for alsa_in than for the jacked soundcard.

&gt; did you read the introduction to:
&gt;
&gt;     http://jackaudio.org/multiple_devices

Yes, I did. And as far as I habe been able to understand it talks about 
using alsa_in, which I am currently trying, or about merging soundcards, 
which you've just disadviced in the previous post - and something I do 
not really find very appealing.

Again, thanks for your help
