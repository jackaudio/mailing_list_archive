Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] alsa_in problems

For the hammerfall: The card is not recognized by the motherboard. lspci 
does not list this card at all and it does not even appear in the POST 
summary before grub comes up.
I've had it running under linux already on my older PC - with an 
asoundrc larger than the telephone book of New York, but I am afraid it 
broke with my other computer, when the PSU went bust. Or these 
newfashoined boards have only rudimentary PCI support left.

And at some point in time the graphical control interface for the 
hammerfall only did work with the hdsp version any more, which I never 
owned. But that is way, way back and I haven't been doing too much audio 
with linux since now. Just trying to get startet with this platform for 
audio to get rid of other operating systems I otherwise do not use any 
more - though my dear old Wavelab 3 is still unmatched over here in 
terms of stereo editing.

If I can't revive my 9652, I'll probably head for am mackie onyx. Until 
I have made that decision, I'll stick with that edirol UA1-EX USB card, 
which does support Hardware monitoring that again is not responsible for 
the feedback, as the monitor port was not even physically connected.
I currently cannot do to much work anyway for other reasons, so that's 
why I take some time and try to get warm with linux and audio and play 
around.

The feedback itself is explained straight forward: The data comes in 
through the mic and is routed instantly to the speakers. No surprise here.
My problem was not the existence of feedback, just the differt behaviour 
to alsa and this is set now.
With ardour I found the Track/Bus inspector, which does what I was 
looking for, I also found something similar on other applications. Still 
I was surprised about the default that anything on the inports gets 
routed automatically to the output without having set up anything - 
except adding an audiotrack.

Haven't exprienced that behaviour before. Thats all and is set. I got my 
mistake. Of course, thanks for your help and efforts even though this is 
off topic for this list.

I will now try to play with the settings, as the dying alsa_in has been 
my larger concern

I have read the jackd man page, but that does not mean I really 
understood everything.
As nperiods are only for playback and I consider record latency slightly 
more relevant, I was under the impression that larger nperiods and 
smaller periods are better. So -n=4 and -p=512 would be better than 
-n=2 and -p=1024. That's why I chose -n=4. Haven't had any xruns so far.

However, I did not know about a2jmidid - will investigate into this and 
since most applications (that I know currently) use alsa midi anyway, 
I'll try without --midi option.

The cards are connected to different USB ports and I use no hub, as the 
edirol stops working, if it has to share the port. Took me a week to 
figure out that a bluetooth dongle stoped everything from working.

So merry christmas to everyone and tanks for your time.
