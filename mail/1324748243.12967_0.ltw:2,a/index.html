Hey,

&gt; The feedback itself is explained straight forward: The data comes in through
&gt; the mic and is routed instantly to the speakers. No surprise here.

Don't you mean;

mic / hw:inputs--&gt;app--&gt; speakers / hw:outputs

and not;

mic /hw:inputs--&gt; speakers / hw:outputs

if it's the former, that makes sense - and there is a patch to disable
that (read below). But, if it is the latter - that seems like abnormal
behavior for Jack, or atleast i have never experienced that before (in
the few years that i have been using Jack).

&gt; My problem was not the existence of feedback, just the differt behaviour to
&gt; alsa and this is set now.
&gt; With ardour I found the Track/Bus inspector, which does what I was looking
&gt; for, I also found something similar on other applications. Still I was
&gt; surprised about the default that anything on the inports gets routed
&gt; automatically to the output without having set up anything - except adding
&gt; an audiotrack.

If you are referring to jack's default behavior of
'auto-connect/self-connect' , there is a patch for jack2 to disable
that functionality, it just isn't provided by default. I know it is
something that i find very useful.  I use Archlinux and the patch is
available in the AUR (Archlinux User Repository) for a Ladish/jackdbus
build of jack2;

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=51977

So, if that patch is something you want, you could download the
tarball from here, as it contains the no-selfconnect.patch , then
download jack2, apply the patch, and build jack yourself...

As a side note - The only apps that might still auto-connect are ones
that use WineASIO (as it has it's own mechanism for enabling/disabling
auto-connect).

my 2 cents ;)

happy holidays everyone!
