Hey,

Don't you mean;

mic / hw:inputs-->app--> speakers / hw:outputs

and not;

mic /hw:inputs--> speakers / hw:outputs

if it's the former, that makes sense - and there is a patch to disable
that (read below). But, if it is the latter - that seems like abnormal
behavior for Jack, or atleast i have never experienced that before (in
the few years that i have been using Jack).

If you are referring to jack's default behavior of
'auto-connect/self-connect' , there is a patch for jack2 to disable
that functionality, it just isn't provided by default. I know it is
something that i find very useful.  I use Archlinux and the patch is
available in the AUR (Archlinux User Repository) for a Ladish/jackdbus
build of jack2;

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=51977

So, if that patch is something you want, you could download the
tarball from here, as it contains the no-selfconnect.patch , then
download jack2, apply the patch, and build jack yourself...

As a side note - The only apps that might still auto-connect are ones
that use WineASIO (as it has it's own mechanism for enabling/disabling
auto-connect).

my 2 cents ;)

happy holidays everyone!
