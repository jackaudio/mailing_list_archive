&gt; At least i provided a link to a patch that disables clients from
&gt; auto-connecting, even if my explanation was inaccurate. 
&gt; But again, sorry for the terrible explanation.

The patch concerns ladish and not JACK; but then again, new users may
have a hard time to distinguish the subtleties and even some seasoned
jack -users or -devs may not be aware of laditools details.

Bringing this up is valid. Although your description of what the patch
does was misleading and wrong. Nevermind, everyone screws up once in a
while.  To make it clear, let me quote Fons:

"There is no such thing as 'jack's default behavior of
auto-connect/self-connect'."


Am I correct in saying that, Arch by default come with additional tools
(jack-ladish) that do auto-connect or self-connect by default and those
tools require a patch to disable it again?

If so, i'd like to learn about the motivation for the "auto-connect or
self-connect" feature.

On that note: is ladish/laditools compatible with qjactctl these days?

The OP mentioned that he starts jackd via qjackctl and and last time I
checked, that was incompatible with ladish. Is that still true? Can they
co-exist or inter-operate?

ciao,
robin
