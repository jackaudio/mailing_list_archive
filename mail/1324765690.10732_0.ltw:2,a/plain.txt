No, not correct.

A basic Arch install comes with nothing. Not even X11. You have to
explicitly install whatever you want. Also, Arch policy is not to
patch upstream unless there is really no choice (e.g. for temporary
bugfixes).

Available Jack related packages are:

fons@zita1:~> pacman -Ss jack

extra/jack 0.121.3-4 [installed]
    A low-latency audio server
extra/qjackctl 0.3.8-1 [installed]
    A Qt front-end for the JACK low-latency audio server
community/jack2 1.9.7-3
    The next-generation JACK with SMP support
community/jack2-dbus 1.9.7-3
    The next-generation JACK with SMP support (for D-BUS interaction only)
community/lash 0.6.0~rc2-6
    A session management system for JACK and ALSA

More are probably available via AUR, the user repository.
