Could be. But there is nothing in the original post that 
suggests that the poster is using ladish or anything similar.

The reason he gets this feedback is that his DAW automatically
enables input monitoring on a new track. 

Even if there were no autoconnect, he would sooner or later
connect his mic manually to the new track, and still have
the same unwanted feedback.

So the real cause of his problem is not the autoconnect. 
It is the simple fact that his DAW is configured for  a
separated studio and control room situation - in that 
case you _want_ input monitoring.

Ciao,
