Well, this is not completely true. It will reconnect if app crashes and
then is relaunched. This is not strictly session restore (as in load) but
is still not initiated without user first making the connection
manually. Or some app doing it... jack cannot distinguish these so
ladish assumes that when connection is initiated through libjack is
made by a user. In this case ladish will just "record" it. This allows
interoperatability with external connection managers but maybe its not
that good idea. ladish daemon presents virtual graphs to connection
managers like gladish and falktx`es Claudia. All connect (and
disconnect) requests to these virtual graph objects comming through
D-Bus are assumed to be initiated by a user, from a specialized patchbay
app.
