Hi Nedko,

I'm glad you chimed in.

That clarified a lot regarding the state of ladi. Thanks!

As for adding this option to vanilla JACK. I'm rather skeptical. I think
this rather works around client-bugs or problems that should be fixed in
the respective clients.

Too many options make trouble-shooting issue with JACK a pain.

My first reaction is that this proposal does not add anything to jack
and thus is not relevant in the core. But I did not give it too much
thought. Is there a good use-case - except for working around b0rked apps?

OTOH I did not investigate how many jack-clients would be affected and
how much it'd improve usability in the real-world with potentially lots
of messy clients.

No.

Primarily I wanted to confirm if someone starting jackd (compiled w/ladi
patches) via qjackctl would experience the /self-connect/ problems that
were described in the original "alsa_in problems" thread.

..and then pondered wider ramifications:

It may well be that distributors allow users to install multiple
jack-session handlers/managers along with one of the (3,4? [2])
available implementations or configurations of jackd. The user can
choose at run-time which of the session managers to start/use and
potentially start/stop more than one.

Thanks,  tl;dr - I'll leave the tab open for tomorrow.

good night,
