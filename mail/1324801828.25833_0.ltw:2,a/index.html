&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to implement new jack1 server option (exposed in jackd too) with
&gt;&gt;&gt; value that defaults to current behaviour. The option (kind of enum) has
&gt;&gt;&gt; four other possible values. In total:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  * dont restrict self connect attempts (default)
&gt;&gt;&gt;  * ignore (dont fail, nop) all self-connect requests
&gt;&gt;&gt;  * fail all self-connect requests
&gt;&gt;&gt;  * ignore self connect requests to other clients only
&gt;&gt;&gt;  * fail self connect requests to other clients only
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If something in my proposal is not clear, please let me know. I'll try
&gt;&gt;&gt; to clarify it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That clarified a lot regarding the state of ladi. Thanks!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As for adding this option to vanilla JACK. I'm rather skeptical. I think
&gt;&gt; this rather works around client-bugs or problems that should be fixed in
&gt;&gt; the respective clients.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Too many options make trouble-shooting issue with JACK a pain.
&gt; 
&gt; IMO few(?) other options we already have are much rarely used and
&gt; less useful.

probably true; but IMHO this is not an argument. (If at all: it's a
counter-argument: the situation is already dire, so why not make it worse..)

&gt;&gt; My first reaction is that this proposal does not add anything to jack
&gt;&gt; and thus is not relevant in the core. But I did not give it too much
&gt;&gt; thought. Is there a good use-case - except for working around b0rked apps?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; OTOH I did not investigate how many jack-clients would be affected and
&gt;&gt; how much it'd improve usability in the real-world with potentially lots
&gt;&gt; of messy clients.
&gt; 
&gt; Its for b0rked apps.

Then maybe this port-override could not be global, but per app instead:
Every time a client creates a new port it is checked against a
jack-connect-blacklist.conf that defines the behavior for those ports..

&gt; Some major ones like ardour2 do it. Essentially
&gt; all-in-one apps tend to implement session manager functionality. And
&gt; this creates interoperatability problem. We don't have unified way to
&gt; tell apps to not self-connect. But we can give the power to the user to
&gt; cut them at the hub - the jack server.
&gt; 
&gt; Telling the user that app X must be fixed to add option for disabling
&gt; self-connect is almost always not acceptable. Because the user has no
&gt; direct and easy control over app X development and deployment of app X
&gt; in distro Y.

indeed.
Actually I start to see some merits of your proposal:
One could safely use any app in a specialized environment (where f.i.
playback_1,2 is not the default speakers) without having to worry about
ruining the hardware connected to those ports (Fons will probably like
that).

&gt; In my, yours and maybe of others opinion fixing clients is the right
&gt; thing to do. But the app author may disagree. Or distro packagers may
&gt; disagree. This is social problem or rather a virtue. 
yes!

&gt;The opposite is stalinism.
Well, surly that's exaggerated.

&gt; People have right to disagree.
&gt; User must be in control of his system. Trying to implement totalitarian
&gt; society by penalizing users is bad idea.

Certainly. Yet, we're not building a society but a real-time low-latency
audio system.

I lean towards the Unix attitude: Make a tool that does one thing and
does it right. Don't try for world-domination or to outsmart the user.
[Try to] educate users (here: software developers and packagers) why
certain things are wrong in JACK-context:

Auto-connecting in pulse-audio or ALSA land is a feature.
Auto-connecting in JACK's realm is wrong(*).
Take your pick; and also feel free to move around. No visa required :)

(*) optional auto-[re]-connect is a feature, too.
Yet it's potentially a gray area when it comes to default behavior of
the JACK auto-connect option.


Once you'll add connection-override to the jack-server's features and
people get used to it, it'll be hard to remove it again I can and
already imagine end-user complaints ("Help my app does no longer
connect.."). I'm torn.


&gt; This does not mean that systems with predefined, fixed and specialized
&gt; workflows should not be developed.
&gt; 
[..]
&gt;&gt; It may well be that distributors allow users to install multiple
&gt;&gt; jack-session handlers/managers along with one of the (3,4? [2])
&gt;&gt; available implementations or configurations of jackd. The user can
&gt;&gt; choose at run-time which of the session managers to start/use and
&gt;&gt; potentially start/stop more than one.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this matches the reality.
&gt; 

Do you [for]see any problems with that?
