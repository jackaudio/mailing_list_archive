&gt; Yesno.

Without the context of the discussion this quote becomes way to bold.

Auto-connecting to the first N (usually two) available physical
jack-ports - while often convenient - is IMHO wrong unless the user
explicitly asked for that.

anyway, getting a bit OT: what actually annoys me more are apps that
re-create their ports. e.g. mplayer on every song change.
certainly a patch-bay (or here also: mplayerrc) can work around this.
but while we're at it would there also be an in-server solution to work
around yet other things for some apps?

e.g a persistent port-pool per app. I'm not saying it's a good idea, but
if you say A you gotta say B, too.

&gt; It would be wrong if jackd should auto-connect or prevent against
&gt; auto-connecting, fortunately jackd doesn't auto-connect or prevent
&gt; against auto-connection.
&gt; 
&gt; If an app has an option to auto-connect it's not borked, for some users
&gt; it's a useful feature. Ardour and Qtractor are AIO apps, when they do
&gt; handle connections it's a good thing. If an external session handler
&gt; can't handle their behaviour it's not bad, since there's no need to use
&gt; a session handler for something that already is managed.
&gt; 
&gt; Why is there the need to handle something that already is handled? And
&gt; to make this possible, to add something to jackd, that also isn't
&gt; needed?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm puzzled,
&gt;
