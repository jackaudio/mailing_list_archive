Without the context of the discussion this quote becomes way to bold.

Auto-connecting to the first N (usually two) available physical
jack-ports - while often convenient - is IMHO wrong unless the user
explicitly asked for that.

anyway, getting a bit OT: what actually annoys me more are apps that
re-create their ports. e.g. mplayer on every song change.
certainly a patch-bay (or here also: mplayerrc) can work around this.
but while we're at it would there also be an in-server solution to work
around yet other things for some apps?

e.g a persistent port-pool per app. I'm not saying it's a good idea, but
if you say A you gotta say B, too.
