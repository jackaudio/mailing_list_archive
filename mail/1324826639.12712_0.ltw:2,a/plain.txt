Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] ladish + jack autoconnect

hey, just a few quick points from the perspective of someone who uses
session management, for a variety of reasons...

This isn't always true.  For your workflow, i have no doubt this may
be true - but it's not universal, and certainly NOT true for myself,
and many other users that i know. Prime examples;

1. I run ALL synths/samplers/looper outside of the DAW and use Ladish
+ FalkTX tools to manage them. This way if a plugin crashes ~ it has
no impact on the project i am working on (ie: my DAW doesn't crash), i
can simply restart the app with GLadish or Claudia.

2. Not all DAWs can host all plugins (instruments). - Think of FST
(VSTi) ... or the fact that Renoise doesn't support LV2 ... i'm sure
you get the idea, but i could go on with more examples. (as there are
tons of situations like this).

**So for me, it completely matters what a client/app's behavior is
like, and having a global way to allow me to change their behavior is
a wonderfully useful feature ;)

3. The other added benefit to session managers is that you don't need
to waste time writing bash scripts for every single project that you
are working on ~ instead you can just add them to your session.

Scripts are great and i used them for a long time (a few years) with
Jackd, but as soon as you have somewhere around 30+ apps/clients
running (which isn't uncommon on my end)  ~ scripts are NOT an ideal
solution (they don't scale well, and it's time-consuming and a slower
way to do things). Session managers tend to be better to work with
(ideally you can accomplish most things using a GUI) and are also much
more dynamic.

I do not think it makes jack complicated to fix (real) issues for
session handlers. Session management is something many users either A)
really want or B). actually require to a large degree.

* Jack_session, Ladish and other session manager's such as OOstudio
(apart of OOmidi) have been developed for a reason...The idea is, if
using session management - you do NOT want apps making those decisions
to a very large degree. *

>My work flow is not to use a session handler. For me it's more
>comfortable to use all-in-one apps that do a good handling.

If you are only using a single app (like a DAW) + maybe an external
app or two, that's good and fine - but Jack's design is to have
interoperability between (potentially) many many applications and even
across multiple machines.... and that is why i use Jack, and that is
what makes Jack so amazingly useful!

It's great that you've found a good workflow that is comfortable, ie:
a small script that launches a few apps + the 'all-in-one' solution.
But it sounds to me like, if (hypothetically) you were a Windows or
Mac user - you wouldn't even _need_ to be using Jack at all ~ given
that you prefer the all-in-one approach (?) ... ie: you could just be
using something like Ableton Live / Logic / protools , and most likely
wouldn't <really> require connecting a chain of external
applications...

While for some of us - Our whole Linux Desktop can thought of as an
'All-in-one' solution (if using session management)...

...and it works very well.

my 2 cents

cheerz and Merry Christmas to all!!
