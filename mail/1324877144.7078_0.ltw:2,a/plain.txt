I suppose that would work for a static volume level, to code
the gain in the max_dB and min_dB values.  However, alsamixer
would not come up when talking with "-D default" or without
the -D option.  I tried the above and a few variations on the
name in the control {} block based on the URL from an earlier
message.  Nothing appeared to allow real-time changes in
volume level.

Fwiw: I think I have a fall-back plan to exchange a public
key at login time on the X terminal (aka zero client) that
should allow ssh to run alsamixer on the terminal's physical
hardware sound card(s) displaying via an ssh tunnel to the
VNC X server running on the server (where all the apps run)
that will be viewed by the VNC viewer back on the X terminal.
That's insanely complex, but with the VNC viewer in full-screen
mode, that's about the only way I can see to do it if softvol
can't be connected to by alsamixer.

Thanks,

Robert
