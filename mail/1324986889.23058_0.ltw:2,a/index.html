&gt; Hello all,

Hi Fons,
&gt; During the weekend I've been working on adaptive resampling
&gt; algorithms (as required for e.g. alsa_in and similar apps).

YAY!

I recently had quite a bit of frustration with varispeed, pitch-shift
playback. libsamplerate slowly approaches a new rates when updating
SRC_DATA-&gt;src_ratio. src_set_ratio() allow for immediate updates at loss
of quality.

How does it compare to rubberband?

&gt; The first tentative result produces around 100 times less
&gt; jitter on the dynamic resample ratio than alsa_in. See 
&gt; &lt;http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/resample.html&gt;,
&gt; The difference in phase noise levels is roughly 40 dB.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact it has reached the point where the performance is no
&gt; longer dominated by random timing errors, but also systematic
&gt; ones resulting from quantisation of some of the variables
&gt; involved in the calculation (mostly frame counts expressed
&gt; as integers) start to show up.
&gt; 
&gt; This is very visible in the time domain test results, but even
&gt; the frequency domain ones start to show this, Note all those
&gt; little discrete lines in the first plot (link above) - each
&gt; of these is the result of a deterministic error pattern.
&gt; 
&gt; This in turn made me look into Jack's timing-related functions.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the values I needed was the microseconds time for the
&gt; start of the current cycle (the one filtered by the DLL). This
&gt; is not available in the public API. It can be computed in two
&gt; ways. The first is
&gt; jack_frames_to_time (client, jack_last_frame_time (client));
&gt; which is a rather convolved way to recompute an already known
&gt; value: client-&gt;engine-&gt;current_time.current_wakeup.
&gt; 
&gt; The second involves using jack_frames_since_cycle_start() and
&gt; jack_get_time() and compute the result from those. This is even
&gt; more convolved and won't produce an accurate result because:
&gt; 
&gt; a) the usecs clock is read twice, the values used should be the
&gt;    same but they won't,
&gt; b) the value returned by jack_frames_since_cycle_start() is
&gt;    quantised to an integer and precision is lost,
&gt; c) the base usecs time used by this function is apparently not
&gt;    the DLL filtered time but the unfiltered one. 
&gt; 
&gt; (c) in fact introduces an inconsistency in the set of time-related
&gt; functions.
&gt; 
&gt; So my first suggestion is to add two functions to transclient.c:
&gt; 
&gt; jack_time_t jack_current_wakeup_time (const jack_client_t *client)
&gt; {
&gt;     return client-&gt;engine-&gt;frame_timer.current_wakeup;
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; jack_time_t jack_next_wakeup_time (const jack_client_t *client)
&gt; {
&gt;     return client-&gt;engine-&gt;frame_timer.next_wakeup;
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; which together with jack_last_frame_time() provide all the 
&gt; info a client could need to do its own calculations to full
&gt; precision.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that it is perfectly safe to read these three values in
&gt; the process callback even without the 'guards' used to ensure
&gt; an atomic copy in jack_read_frame_time() - a new cycle isn't 
&gt; supposed to start at that time (and if it does there is bigger
&gt; trouble ahead anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; An alternative would be to provide a single function to allow
&gt; a client to read all three in a single call, with or without
&gt; guards.
&gt; 

unless someone can point out a case for individually querying
jack_current_wakeup_time() and jack_next_wakeup_time(), your 2nd idea
seems best:

int jack_get_cycle_timing (
  const jack_client_t* client,
  jack_nframes_t*      last_frame_time,
  jack_time_t*         current_wakeup_time,
  jack_time_t*         next_wakeup_time,
);

Yet, your first proposal of adding two functions is more conform with
the existing JACK API.

&gt; Another way to provide better precision would be to let
&gt; jack_frames_since_cycle_start() return a double or float,
&gt; and to modify the two frames&lt;-&gt;usecs conversion functions
&gt; to accept/return a float or double frametime referenced
&gt; to the start of the cycle (i.e. removing the potentially
&gt; large offset, which is given by jack_last_frame_time()
&gt; anyway).

Keep that in mind for Jack3.

Modifying the API - even if it fixes somewhat broken behaviour -  is
currently worse than simply adding an interface or two.

2c,
robin
