&gt; Hi all, has anyone out there experienced something similar to what I 
&gt; describe below? Sorry for the length of the post.
&gt;
&gt; I'm really puzzled...
&gt;
&gt; (running jack 1.9.8, freshly built today, just in case - running with 
&gt; 4096 total ports and 768 ports per client)
&gt;
&gt; I have a quite complex jack based system (OpenMixer in our Listening 
&gt; Room driving 22 speakers plus 4 subs). Many programs, all interconnected 
&gt; through jack and running under Linux (ie: jack itself, three instances 
&gt; of supercollider, three instances of ambdec, two instances of 
&gt; jconvolver, four internal 24 channel netjack1 clients, etc, etc). 
&gt; Everything is run from inside the supercollider language and startup is 
&gt; automatic from a boot of the workstation. All jack connections are 
&gt; managed by writing them to a file and then running aj-snapshot.
&gt;
&gt; Lately one or two speakers are "silent" after startup. Restarting the 
&gt; audio engine sometimes fixes the problem, sometimes moves it to a 
&gt; different speaker. Not all speakers are equal in that sense, in most of 
&gt; them this never happens, in some of them it nearly always does. There is 
&gt; nothing special in the speakers that sometimes fail, they all come from 
&gt; the same hardware source. And from the clues described below it does not 
&gt; look like it is a hardware problem.
&gt;
&gt; As far as I can tell jack gets into a state where sometimes a given port 
&gt; goes nowhere instead of going to the soundcard output it should go to.
&gt;
&gt; That is, system:playback_25 is there, other ports connect and disconnect 
&gt; to it normally, no errors are logged and yet input to that port does not 
&gt; go to the corresponding speaker (all the associated equipment seems to 
&gt; be fine). If I restart the system suddenly the port works fine. Or not. 
&gt; Or some other port does not work. At most two or three fail, usually 
&gt; just one, sometimes none (the problem seems to have gotten worse since I 
&gt; added more things to the system that implied more clients and total 
&gt; ports and connections).
&gt;
&gt; If I do _not_ run the aj-snapshot port connection process and I manually 
&gt; send a signal (from jnoise) to the ports that are normally affected, 
&gt; everything is fine, that is, in my tests I never managed to get the 
&gt; system to fail in that state (ie: everything running, no ports connected).
&gt;
&gt; It would seem that something bad is happening when all ports are being 
&gt; connected and the end result is that inside jack some of the soundcard 
&gt; ports seem to go nowhere.
&gt;
&gt; The aj-snapshot process that connects everything takes a bit to run and 
&gt; as it progresses jack reports more and more xruns until it finishes. It 
&gt; would seem that something is running inside jack when ports are 
&gt; connected that is proportional to the number of existing connections 
&gt; (the graph reordering?, that would make sense - but it should not 
&gt; generate xruns, right?).
&gt;
&gt; It also appears to be that if I minimize the number of ports I'm 
&gt; connecting the problem goes away (but then of course the system is not 
&gt; completely functional :-).
&gt;
&gt; Clues?
&gt; Ways to debug?
&gt; Anyone seen something similar?
&gt;

On the very off chance a newbie's suggestion might help, when I
set up a massively simpler system (NetJACK2, one master, one
slave, two channels each way) I found I needed to wait after
starting jackd, alsa_in, and alsa_out before I could reliably run
jack_connect.  As an example, here's a C-shell script (loop
syntax differs from bash):

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv cut here vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
#!/bin/csh -f

# C-shell script that runs on the server to start the JACK slave side.

# Check and get arguments.
if ( 2 != $# ) then
  echo 'ERROR: '$0' needs 2 arguments, got '$#
  exit(1)
endif
set ip = $1
set pt = $2
echo 'Slave-side multicast IP:   '$ip
echo 'Slave-side multicast port: '$pt

# Start the JACK server.
jackd -R -d net -a $ip -p $pt &gt;&amp; jack-server.log &amp;

# loop client creation
# /usr/bin/alsa_out -j ploop -dploop -q 1 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt; /dev/null &amp;
# /usr/bin/alsa_in  -j cloop -dcloop -q 1 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt; /dev/null &amp;
/usr/bin/alsa_out -j ploop -dploop &gt;&amp; alsa-out.log &amp;
/usr/bin/alsa_in  -j cloop -dcloop &gt;&amp; alsa-in.log  &amp;

# Wait until the ports are available.
set ports = (system:{capture,playback}_{1,2})
set ports = ($ports {ploop:playback,cloop:capture}_{1,2})
foreach port ($ports)
  while ( 0 == `jack_lsp | fgrep -c $port` )
    echo 'Waiting for port '$port
    sleep 1
  end
end
echo 'Got ports:'
jack_lsp

# cloop ports -&gt; jack output ports 
jack_connect cloop:capture_1 system:playback_1
jack_connect cloop:capture_2 system:playback_2

# system input to "ploop" ports  
jack_connect system:capture_1 ploop:playback_1
jack_connect system:capture_2 ploop:playback_2

# Show the connections.
echo 'Made port connections:'
jack_lsp -c
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sending all output to log files is a big help in enabling
debug.  The big loop in the middle waits until all ports
from jackd, alsa_in, and alsa_out are available before
doing any connecting.  The script also prints what ports
it saw after waiting (to validate the script waited long
enough), and prints what connections it made.

This script starts the master.  This one is for /bin/sh:

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv cut here vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
#!/bin/sh

# Born-shell script to start a JACK master session.
# It takes the multicast IP address and the port number as arguments.

# Check and get arguments.
if [ "2" != "$#" ]; then
  echo 'ERROR: '$0' needs 2 arguments, got '$#
  exit 1
fi
ip=$1
pt=$2
echo 'Master-side multicast IP:   '$ip
echo 'Master-side multicast port: '$pt

# Start the JACK server.
# Rely on limits set in bootlocal.sh to do real-time and such.
jackd -R -d alsa -d default &amp;&gt; jack-server.log &amp;

# Wait for the server to initialize.
sleep 2

# Load the net manager.
jack_load netmanager -i "-a $ip -p $pt"

# Wait until the remote ports are available.
echo 'About to wait for remote ports to become available.'
while [ $(jack_lsp | fgrep -c one.localnet) -eq 0 ]
do
  echo 'Waiting for remote ports to be available...'
  sleep 1
  jack_lsp &gt; /dev/null
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo 'Master-side JACK server is not running.  Aborting.'
    exit 1
  fi
done
echo 'Finished waiting for remote ports to become available.'
echo ''
echo ''

# Connect the JACK ports.
jack_connect one.localnet:from_slave_1 alsa_pcm:default:in1
jack_connect one.localnet:from_slave_2 alsa_pcm:default:in2

# Show the connections:
echo 'JACK ports connected:'
jack_lsp -c
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The above script does similar things to wait for ports to appear,
and then it prints out what it did for debugging.

Oh, and if using softvol triggered from a .asoundrc file on a
non-persistent (PXE-booted system), it is necessary to play
something via aplay or etc. before the control appears.  This
snippet does that trick for my X terminal (zero client):

# Play burst(s) of noise to make the 'Softmaster' volume control appear.
aplay /opt/termos/softshortnoise.wav &amp;
sleep 0.25
killall aplay
sleep 0.25
aplay /opt/termos/softshortnoise.wav &amp;
sleep 0.5
killall aplay
sleep 0.5
