On the very off chance a newbie's suggestion might help, when I
set up a massively simpler system (NetJACK2, one master, one
slave, two channels each way) I found I needed to wait after
starting jackd, alsa_in, and alsa_out before I could reliably run
jack_connect.  As an example, here's a C-shell script (loop
syntax differs from bash):

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv cut here vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
#!/bin/csh -f

# C-shell script that runs on the server to start the JACK slave side.

# Check and get arguments.
if ( 2 != $# ) then
  echo 'ERROR: '$0' needs 2 arguments, got '$#
  exit(1)
endif
set ip = $1
set pt = $2
echo 'Slave-side multicast IP:   '$ip
echo 'Slave-side multicast port: '$pt

# Start the JACK server.
jackd -R -d net -a $ip -p $pt >& jack-server.log &

# loop client creation
# /usr/bin/alsa_out -j ploop -dploop -q 1 2>&1 1> /dev/null &
# /usr/bin/alsa_in  -j cloop -dcloop -q 1 2>&1 1> /dev/null &
/usr/bin/alsa_out -j ploop -dploop >& alsa-out.log &
/usr/bin/alsa_in  -j cloop -dcloop >& alsa-in.log  &

# Wait until the ports are available.
set ports = (system:{capture,playback}_{1,2})
set ports = ($ports {ploop:playback,cloop:capture}_{1,2})
foreach port ($ports)
  while ( 0 == `jack_lsp | fgrep -c $port` )
    echo 'Waiting for port '$port
    sleep 1
  end
end
echo 'Got ports:'
jack_lsp

# cloop ports -> jack output ports 
jack_connect cloop:capture_1 system:playback_1
jack_connect cloop:capture_2 system:playback_2

# system input to "ploop" ports  
jack_connect system:capture_1 ploop:playback_1
jack_connect system:capture_2 ploop:playback_2

# Show the connections.
echo 'Made port connections:'
jack_lsp -c
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sending all output to log files is a big help in enabling
debug.  The big loop in the middle waits until all ports
from jackd, alsa_in, and alsa_out are available before
doing any connecting.  The script also prints what ports
it saw after waiting (to validate the script waited long
enough), and prints what connections it made.

This script starts the master.  This one is for /bin/sh:

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv cut here vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
#!/bin/sh

# Born-shell script to start a JACK master session.
# It takes the multicast IP address and the port number as arguments.

# Check and get arguments.
if [ "2" != "$#" ]; then
  echo 'ERROR: '$0' needs 2 arguments, got '$#
  exit 1
fi
ip=$1
pt=$2
echo 'Master-side multicast IP:   '$ip
echo 'Master-side multicast port: '$pt

# Start the JACK server.
# Rely on limits set in bootlocal.sh to do real-time and such.
jackd -R -d alsa -d default &> jack-server.log &

# Wait for the server to initialize.
sleep 2

# Load the net manager.
jack_load netmanager -i "-a $ip -p $pt"

# Wait until the remote ports are available.
echo 'About to wait for remote ports to become available.'
while [ $(jack_lsp | fgrep -c one.localnet) -eq 0 ]
do
  echo 'Waiting for remote ports to be available...'
  sleep 1
  jack_lsp > /dev/null
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo 'Master-side JACK server is not running.  Aborting.'
    exit 1
  fi
done
echo 'Finished waiting for remote ports to become available.'
echo ''
echo ''

# Connect the JACK ports.
jack_connect one.localnet:from_slave_1 alsa_pcm:default:in1
jack_connect one.localnet:from_slave_2 alsa_pcm:default:in2

# Show the connections:
echo 'JACK ports connected:'
jack_lsp -c
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The above script does similar things to wait for ports to appear,
and then it prints out what it did for debugging.

Oh, and if using softvol triggered from a .asoundrc file on a
non-persistent (PXE-booted system), it is necessary to play
something via aplay or etc. before the control appears.  This
snippet does that trick for my X terminal (zero client):

# Play burst(s) of noise to make the 'Softmaster' volume control appear.
aplay /opt/termos/softshortnoise.wav &
sleep 0.25
killall aplay
sleep 0.25
aplay /opt/termos/softshortnoise.wav &
sleep 0.5
killall aplay
sleep 0.5
