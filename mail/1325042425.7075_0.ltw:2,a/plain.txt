Hi,

I got jack 1.9.8 running; connecting 8 Native Instruments Maschine into 8 
Ableton live channels then back to speakers succesfully but audio is cracking 
too much.

I'm using an rme fireface soundcard on win7 x64, launching portaudio like this: 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::ASIO 
Fireface USB" -r 96000 -p 192

I get 4ms @96Khz/192 samples instead of 3ms without jack and cpu usage is about 
the same but the audio is very cracky, just like having a too small buffer size 
set but with the cpu usage jumping; setting a bigger buffer size even 2048 
sample doen't help 

In the portaudio console, i don't get "Cannot lock down memory area (No error)" 
message but instead when launching first audio soft(Maschine in that exemple):

Cannot read named pipe = \\.\pipe\server_jack_default_0 err = 109
handlerequest: cannot read header
Allocate: named semaphore already exist name ) jack_pipe.default_Maschine

Any hint? the configuration seems correct, could it be an RME asio driver issue 
or should it perform better than that?
