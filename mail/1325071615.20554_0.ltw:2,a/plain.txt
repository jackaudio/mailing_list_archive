The complexity of the graph doesn't directly depend on the number
of ports - all that matters is if app A is driving app B or not.
The algorithms used to manage the graph should take advantage
of that, but I don't know if they do. Anyway I'd suspect the 
problem to be with individual port/conncection management.

Suggestions:

- If you have any apps using port/connection callbacks, remove
  these.

- Patch aj-snapshot so it delivers a fixed number of requests
  per unit time instead of running as-fast-as-possible.
