&gt;&gt; It would seem that something bad is happening when all ports are being
&gt;&gt; connected and the end result is that inside jack some of the soundcard
&gt;&gt; ports seem to go nowhere.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The aj-snapshot process that connects everything takes a bit to run and
&gt;&gt; as it progresses jack reports more and more xruns until it finishes. It
&gt;&gt; would seem that something is running inside jack when ports are
&gt;&gt; connected that is proportional to the number of existing connections
&gt;&gt; (the graph reordering?, that would make sense - but it should not
&gt;&gt; generate xruns, right?).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It also appears to be that if I minimize the number of ports I'm
&gt;&gt; connecting the problem goes away (but then of course the system is not
&gt;&gt; completely functional :-).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Clues?
&gt;&gt; Ways to debug?
&gt;
&gt; The complexity of the graph doesn't directly depend on the number
&gt; of ports - all that matters is if app A is driving app B or not.
&gt; The algorithms used to manage the graph should take advantage
&gt; of that, but I don't know if they do. Anyway I'd suspect the
&gt; problem to be with individual port/conncection management.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions:
&gt;
&gt; - If you have any apps using port/connection callbacks, remove
&gt;    these.

Hmmm, I'll check, I don't think so (all apps are stock except for the sc 
program - I'm not setting any callbacks myself).

I did try to use "-v" in jackd to see more details but the amount of 
stuff being printed out slowed down things so much it did not work (most 
was about recalculating port latencies - maybe after each connection?).

&gt; - Patch aj-snapshot so it delivers a fixed number of requests
&gt;    per unit time instead of running as-fast-as-possible.

I did add a delay after each connection yesterday and it did not seem to 
make a difference.

One more test that occurred to me overnight is to send noise over the 
troublesome channels starting right before the aj-snapshot run starts, 
to really really make sure that the connection process is what is 
causing the problem.

Thanks for the suggestions!
