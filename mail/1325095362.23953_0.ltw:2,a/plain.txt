Hmmm, I'll check, I don't think so (all apps are stock except for the sc 
program - I'm not setting any callbacks myself).

I did try to use "-v" in jackd to see more details but the amount of 
stuff being printed out slowed down things so much it did not work (most 
was about recalculating port latencies - maybe after each connection?).

I did add a delay after each connection yesterday and it did not seem to 
make a difference.

One more test that occurred to me overnight is to send noise over the 
troublesome channels starting right before the aj-snapshot run starts, 
to really really make sure that the connection process is what is 
causing the problem.

Thanks for the suggestions!
