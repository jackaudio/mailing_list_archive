&gt; Hi all, has anyone out there experienced something similar to what I
&gt; describe below? Sorry for the length of the post.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really puzzled...
&gt; 
&gt; (running jack 1.9.8, freshly built today, just in case - running with
&gt; 4096 total ports and 768 ports per client)
&gt; 
&gt; I have a quite complex jack based system (OpenMixer in our Listening
&gt; Room driving 22 speakers plus 4 subs). Many programs, all interconnected
&gt; through jack and running under Linux (ie: jack itself, three instances
&gt; of supercollider, three instances of ambdec, two instances of
&gt; jconvolver, four internal 24 channel netjack1 clients, etc, etc).
&gt; Everything is run from inside the supercollider language and startup is
&gt; automatic from a boot of the workstation. All jack connections are
&gt; managed by writing them to a file and then running aj-snapshot.
&gt; 
&gt; Lately one or two speakers are "silent" after startup.

Does downgrading jackd to 1.9.7 help?

Which version of aj-snapshot are you using?
There's been some activity the the last weeks. e.g 4 weeks ago:
  "graph reorder jackd bug workaround implemented"
I don't know the details, but there's more:
http://aj-snapshot.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=aj-snapshot/aj-snapshot;a=log


&gt; Restarting the
&gt; audio engine sometimes fixes the problem, sometimes moves it to a
&gt; different speaker. Not all speakers are equal in that sense, in most of
&gt; them this never happens, in some of them it nearly always does. There is
&gt; nothing special in the speakers that sometimes fail, they all come from
&gt; the same hardware source. And from the clues described below it does not
&gt; look like it is a hardware problem.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I can tell jack gets into a state where sometimes a given port
&gt; goes nowhere instead of going to the soundcard output it should go to.
&gt; 
&gt; That is, system:playback_25 is there, other ports connect and disconnect
&gt; to it normally, no errors are logged and yet input to that port does not
&gt; go to the corresponding speaker (all the associated equipment seems to
&gt; be fine). If I restart the system suddenly the port works fine. Or not.
&gt; Or some other port does not work. At most two or three fail, usually
&gt; just one, sometimes none (the problem seems to have gotten worse since I
&gt; added more things to the system that implied more clients and total
&gt; ports and connections).
&gt; 
&gt; If I do _not_ run the aj-snapshot port connection process and I manually
&gt; send a signal (from jnoise) to the ports that are normally affected,
&gt; everything is fine, that is, in my tests I never managed to get the
&gt; system to fail in that state (ie: everything running, no ports connected).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It would seem that something bad is happening when all ports are being
&gt; connected and the end result is that inside jack some of the soundcard
&gt; ports seem to go nowhere.

sounds like jackd's internal connection state somehow becomes
inconsistent. There was a bug in the dbus code a while ago (1.9.6): the
dbus layer kept an independent list of the connections but that was
fixed in 1.9.6+svn before 1.9.7.

I can't see how aj-snapshot could be the culprit; but minimizing the
number of tools involved makes it easy.


&gt; The aj-snapshot process that connects everything takes a bit to run and
&gt; as it progresses jack reports more and more xruns until it finishes. It
&gt; would seem that something is running inside jack when ports are
&gt; connected that is proportional to the number of existing connections
&gt; (the graph reordering?, that would make sense - but it should not
&gt; generate xruns, right?).
&gt; 
&gt; It also appears to be that if I minimize the number of ports I'm
&gt; connecting the problem goes away (but then of course the system is not
&gt; completely functional :-).
&gt; 
&gt; Clues?
&gt; Ways to debug?

pinpoint _when_ it goes wrong -&gt; that makes it easier to determine
_where_ it goes wrong.

1)Try `jnoise` after startup -&gt; verify signals end up at speakers.
2)Launch all apps; walk the `jnoise` again.
3)run aj-connect.
4)`jnoise` again.

sth like:

#!/bin/bash
jnoise; sleep 1;
i=1; while [ $i -lt 26 ]; do \
  jack_connect jnoise:pink system:playback_$i; \
  sleep 1;
  jack_disconnect jnoise:pink system:playback_$i; \
  sleep 1;
  i=$[ $i + 1 ];\
done


`jack_lsp -c | grep "^ " | wc -l` counts the current number of
connections times two. Maybe things go amiss after 4096 connections are
made or sth... just guessing.

&gt; Anyone seen something similar?
no.
