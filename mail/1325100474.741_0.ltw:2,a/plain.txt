Does downgrading jackd to 1.9.7 help?

Which version of aj-snapshot are you using?
There's been some activity the the last weeks. e.g 4 weeks ago:
  "graph reorder jackd bug workaround implemented"
I don't know the details, but there's more:
http://aj-snapshot.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=aj-snapshot/aj-snapshot;a=log

sounds like jackd's internal connection state somehow becomes
inconsistent. There was a bug in the dbus code a while ago (1.9.6): the
dbus layer kept an independent list of the connections but that was
fixed in 1.9.6+svn before 1.9.7.

I can't see how aj-snapshot could be the culprit; but minimizing the
number of tools involved makes it easy.

pinpoint _when_ it goes wrong -> that makes it easier to determine
_where_ it goes wrong.

1)Try `jnoise` after startup -> verify signals end up at speakers.
2)Launch all apps; walk the `jnoise` again.
3)run aj-connect.
4)`jnoise` again.

sth like:

#!/bin/bash
jnoise; sleep 1;
i=1; while [ $i -lt 26 ]; do \
  jack_connect jnoise:pink system:playback_$i; \
  sleep 1;
  jack_disconnect jnoise:pink system:playback_$i; \
  sleep 1;
  i=$[ $i + 1 ];\
done


`jack_lsp -c | grep "^ " | wc -l` counts the current number of
connections times two. Maybe things go amiss after 4096 connections are
made or sth... just guessing.
