It was happening in 1.9.7 and I upgraded :-)

Latest, 0.9.5...

Thanks for the pointer, perhaps I should try git just in case. I looked 
at the 0.9.5 source and it seemed fine (and what it is doing is not 
complicated at all, just make the connection and wait till it gets the 
callback before proceeding using mutex's - I even added delays after 
each connection with no change in behavior).

I don't think aj-snapshot is the culprit, it seems to me so far that 
aj-snapshot is triggering a problem inside jackd. But the clues are not 
clear at all.

Yup, I was going to do something similar today from inside supercollider :-)
Thanks!
