Google's preview shows me something that looks like a commercial
for a certain medication.  I take it that's the "weird stuff".
"wget http://jackaudio.org" and "html2text index.html | more"
shows me this (some indentation mine):

                              Have you ever wanted to take the audio output of
                              one piece of software and send it to another? How
                              about taking the output of that same program and
                              send it to two others, then record the result in
                              the first program? Or maybe you're a programmer
                              who writes real-time audio and music applications
                              and who is looking for a cross-platform API that
                              enables not only device sharing but also inter-
                              application audio routing, and is incredibly easy
                              to learn and use? If so, JACK may be what you've
                              been looking for.
                              ...

It would appear the defacing might be intermittent or dependent
on factors other than just the user-agent string.
