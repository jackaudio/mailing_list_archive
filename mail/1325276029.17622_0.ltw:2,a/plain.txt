Someone manged to inject some byte-compiled PHP code into index.php.
I've removed it, and made the file non-writable by anyone.

I don't know if this was done via a weakness in drupal 6 (of which
there are many) or via some login access. My suspicion is that it was
web-based but the access log, while showing an access right at the
time the index.php was altered (Dec 26th 00:46) doesn't suggest
anything odd. I guess I'll have to write to Dreamhost and ask if they
are aware of other cracks like this.

I've checked the md5sum on the tarball of 0.121.3 and its unaltered. I
suspect this was a PHP-only attack.
