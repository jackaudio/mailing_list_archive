Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] www.jackaudio.org defacement

for now, i've switched the user that the website "runs as", but made a
different user the owner of all the files that comprise the website
itself. in theory this should prevent web-vectored attacks from
modifying any files. dreamhost does things slightly oddly AFAICT: i
think the httpd server itself runs as "nobody" but any CGI scripts are
executed as a specified user.

i also changed all passwords (including database access passwords etc).

we'll see how well this holds up against the pharma crackers.
