I plan to move ardour.org to AWS soon with a similar configuration.
Hadn't considered jackaudio.org but maybe its a candidate.

I didn't check the ssh logs, but i did check with last(1) and nobody
but me had logged in as the "jack" user (whose name isn't actually
"jack"). when i say "me" i mean my IP address.

DH ran their own "security check" which was fairly lame, picking up
ardour/jack/ffado SVN access as a possible attack :)

fairly sure that DH has a fairly serious firewall.
