&gt; Paul, I would suggest moving to a better-managed hosting service.

there are lots of issues with Dreamhost, but to be fair this pharma
hack seems very widespread across a variety of hosting services and
pretty much any platform that uses a language that includes "eval".

&gt; I recommend hostgator because I know how our security team works, and I know
&gt; that, for our shared services, we use the Worker MPM, suphp as our PHP
&gt; handler, and suexec enabled. Scripts execute as the user and are, therefore,
&gt; properly restricted in what they can do. Setting files +ia works,

what filesystem are you using that supports these?

&gt; personally deal with every day. The security team has scripts that are
&gt; constantly being updated to detect and resolve issues like this, and if this
&gt; had happened on one of our servers, it would have been resolved within an
&gt; hour and would not recur.

how would your scripts have detected it? would they be looking
specifically for suspicious PHP?
