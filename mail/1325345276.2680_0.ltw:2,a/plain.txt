I do not record anything with the sound card.  I produce using software 
synthesizers and samples that are recorded elsewhere.  This whole 
process doesn't even touch the sound card, since it's rendered directly 
from the software to a WAV file.  So quality isn't affected by the sound 
card at all.  Only thing I need is fast response for my MIDI keyboard 
(software synths also add quite a bit of latency, which is why I feel a 
difference between 5 and 2.6ms.)  And I only need 2 channels; only use 
stereo monitors.

So a "professional" sound card is totally wasted here.  I just need it 
to be low latency with JACK.
