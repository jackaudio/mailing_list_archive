you seem to be describing a process that seems a bit contradictory to
me: on the one hand, you say "its rendered directly from the software
to a .wav file", but then you later say "i need [] fast respond for my
MIDI keyboard", and mention software synthesis, which to me implies
that you want to listen to what you're playing on a MIDI keyboard.

the reason that the cards at the ardour FAQ are recommended is because
of their technical design, which involves a number of subtle details
that make a huge difference to their actual behaviour in use. i didn't
recommend them because of their earth-shatteringly good A/D or DA, or
because of their special linear whatnots. most consumer/game oriented
cards are simply not correctly designed to be used for simultaneous
playback and recording, or put differently, for simultaneous input and
output. the fact that someone might additionally copy the samples  to
disk for "recording" has nothing to do with the basic design of an
audio interface intended to be used in this way.

now, if its true that you only ever do playback via the audio
interface, and never accept audio input from it, then these design
considerations are not as important. but do you really want to buy a
device for doing musical stuff and then later find out that your
ability to process incoming audio (note that i did not say
"recording") is compromised by its inferior technical design?

also, if you really believe you can tell the difference between 5 and
2.6msec, i suggest you try that in a double blind test sometime.
unless you're in the upper echelon of time-sensitive humans, my guess
is that you won't reliably be able to say which one is in use. I'm
guessing you're already aware that the air distance between you and
your monitors is probably adding 3msec of latency compared to when you
wear headphones ...
