i've had this discussion with nedko on IRC before i stopped being
prepared to discuss things with him (and why would i do that? "the
entire JACK API has been shit right from the start". no need to
discuss that further then).

the proposal has some merits i think. i don't think its very useful
for most use cases, but in some reasonably likely ones, some of these
options would be very useful to have. it would integrate quite well
with JACK Session, and enables that and ladish to do what they want
without having to modify clients, which is a good thing. but ... to be
actually useful, i suspect that this option needs to be controllable
in a running server, not just at startup.
