&gt;&gt; I do not record anything with the sound card.  I produce using software
&gt;&gt; synthesizers and samples that are recorded elsewhere.  This whole process
&gt;&gt; doesn't even touch the sound card, since it's rendered directly from the
&gt;&gt; software to a WAV file.  So quality isn't affected by the sound card at all.
&gt;&gt;   Only thing I need is fast response for my MIDI keyboard (software synths
&gt;&gt; also add quite a bit of latency, which is why I feel a difference between 5
&gt;&gt; and 2.6ms.)  And I only need 2 channels; only use stereo monitors.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So a "professional" sound card is totally wasted here.  I just need it to be
&gt;&gt; low latency with JACK.
&gt;
&gt; you seem to be describing a process that seems a bit contradictory to
&gt; me: on the one hand, you say "its rendered directly from the software
&gt; to a .wav file", but then you later say "i need [] fast respond for my
&gt; MIDI keyboard", and mention software synthesis, which to me implies
&gt; that you want to listen to what you're playing on a MIDI keyboard.

That's just the real-time preview while compositing and arranging.  It 
has not effect on the final rendering which goes straight to disk.  I'm 
sure you used something like that before?


&gt; now, if its true that you only ever do playback via the audio
&gt; interface, and never accept audio input from it, then these design
&gt; considerations are not as important. but do you really want to buy a
&gt; device for doing musical stuff and then later find out that your
&gt; ability to process incoming audio (note that i did not say
&gt; "recording") is compromised by its inferior technical design?

A) I do not have any kind of incoming audio (not even when talking on 
Skype; I have a USB mic.)

B) I don't have the money for a pro card, which means I have to find 
something affordable that suits my requirement.


&gt; also, if you really believe you can tell the difference between 5 and
&gt; 2.6msec, i suggest you try that in a double blind test sometime.
&gt; unless you're in the upper echelon of time-sensitive humans, my guess
&gt; is that you won't reliably be able to say which one is in use. I'm
&gt; guessing you're already aware that the air distance between you and
&gt; your monitors is probably adding 3msec of latency compared to when you
&gt; wear headphones ...

My theory is that the 2.6ms just bring the overall down.  Might be 
something like 10ms total. If it gets down to 7ms, that's a difference 
that can be felt.

I sort of did double blind tests by accident.  Brought up the whole 
stack with the 5.33ms target by mistake.  I felt something was off, 
especially when playing sixteenths at over 140bpm.  This happened a few 
times.
