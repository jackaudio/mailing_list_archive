That's just the real-time preview while compositing and arranging.  It 
has not effect on the final rendering which goes straight to disk.  I'm 
sure you used something like that before?

A) I do not have any kind of incoming audio (not even when talking on 
Skype; I have a USB mic.)

B) I don't have the money for a pro card, which means I have to find 
something affordable that suits my requirement.

My theory is that the 2.6ms just bring the overall down.  Might be 
something like 10ms total. If it gets down to 7ms, that's a difference 
that can be felt.

I sort of did double blind tests by accident.  Brought up the whole 
stack with the 5.33ms target by mistake.  I felt something was off, 
especially when playing sixteenths at over 140bpm.  This happened a few 
times.
