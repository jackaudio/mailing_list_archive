&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that I think of it, I dont recall proposing to implement this option
&gt;&gt;&gt; for jack1. So here I do it:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to implement new jack1 server option (exposed in jackd too) with
&gt;&gt;&gt; value that defaults to current behaviour. The option (kind of enum) has
&gt;&gt;&gt; four other possible values. In total:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#xA0;* dont restrict self connect attempts (default)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#xA0;* ignore (dont fail, nop) all self-connect requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#xA0;* fail all self-connect requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#xA0;* ignore self connect requests to other clients only
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#xA0;* fail self connect requests to other clients only
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If something in my proposal is not clear, please let me know. I'll try
&gt;&gt;&gt; to clarify it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ..now that the mailing-list and jackaudio.org infrastructure is working
&gt;&gt; fine again..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; would the jack-maintainers care to comment on this proposal?
&gt;
&gt; i've had this discussion with nedko on IRC before i stopped being
&gt; prepared to discuss things with him (and why would i do that? "the
&gt; entire JACK API has been shit right from the start". no need to
&gt; discuss that further then).

You don't have evidence of me saying this (and you even used
quotes). What I said was "i disagree with most of the jack api and i've
told this in public":

Feb 08 18:09:52 nedko	i disagree with most of the jack api and i've told this in public
Feb 08 18:10:18 las	nedko: then go and write your own fucking version of it and stop wasting our time complaining about here. for fuck's sake
Feb 08 18:10:22 *	las (~[hidden]) has left #jack ("Leaving")

What you maybe miss here is that I was talking about jack connect veto
proposal, not voting.

&gt; the proposal has some merits i think. i don't think its very useful
&gt; for most use cases, but in some reasonably likely ones, some of these
&gt; options would be very useful to have. it would integrate quite well
&gt; with JACK Session, and enables that and ladish to do what they want
&gt; without having to modify clients, which is a good thing. but ... to be
&gt; actually useful, i suspect that this option needs to be controllable
&gt; in a running server, not just at startup.

Do I get it right that you will accept patch that adds both startup
option and makes it controlable in a running server?
