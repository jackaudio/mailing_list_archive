Feb 08 18:09:52 nedko	i disagree with most of the jack api and i've told this in public
Feb 08 18:10:18 las	nedko: then go and write your own fucking version of it and stop wasting our time complaining about here. for fuck's sake

Do I get it right that you will accept patch that adds both startup
option and makes it controlable in a running server?
