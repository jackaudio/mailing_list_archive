&gt; &gt;&gt; It's about the on-board sound chip being quite lame latency-wise, while

&gt; &gt;Are you really surprised by that?

I would. There are rumors some (onboard) HDAs can do eight samples per
buffer. I have no idea if this is true, but I can confirm 2x32 on a
couple of motherboards I have around. That's 0.7ms at 48kHz.

&gt; Looks like I'll need a sound card.  Having looked around, I see that
&gt; for Linux the Xonar cards from Asus have good drivers. Does anyone
&gt; here use a Xonar with JACK?  I can get the Xonar DS or the D1 here.

Paul has already answered this. Given that you can't spend much money, I
suggest you try some used PCI cards and go for the one that gives you
the best results.

I still wonder if there's anything wrong with your setup, because I've
been playing synthesizers at 12ms for years, including fast rock'n'roll
piano repetitions.


Cheers
