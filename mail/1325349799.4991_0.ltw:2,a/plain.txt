I would. There are rumors some (onboard) HDAs can do eight samples per
buffer. I have no idea if this is true, but I can confirm 2x32 on a
couple of motherboards I have around. That's 0.7ms at 48kHz.

Paul has already answered this. Given that you can't spend much money, I
suggest you try some used PCI cards and go for the one that gives you
the best results.

I still wonder if there's anything wrong with your setup, because I've
been playing synthesizers at 12ms for years, including fast rock'n'roll
piano repetitions.


Cheers
