Ok so here's a plan waiting for aproval:

 1. wait until nobody else raises some fundamental objection
 2. Paul Davis declares that wait is complete
 3. Nedko Arnaudov makes a detailed proposal with implementation details
 4. Paul Davis approves it or crtiticizes it with goto step 3
 5. Nedko Arnaudov implements the approved detailed proposal and sends
    it to mailing list for review.
 6. Paul Davis verifies that its generally clean and matches the
    detailed proposal from step 3. If it is not generally clean or the
    patch does not match the proposal from step 3, goto step 5.
 7. Paul Davis commits it to jack1
 8. Stephane Letz declares that he will accept equivalent improvement in
    jack2.
 9. Nedko Arnaudov modifies the existing patch to include make the
    option controllable in a running server.
 10. Stephane Letz reviews the no-self-connect git branch and eventually
    merges it into jack2 trunk (and will be part of next jack2 release).
    If its not ok, goto step 9.

I'll go with steps 1 to 7 if Paul Davis publicly agrees with them.
I'll go with steps 8 to 10 if Stephane Letz agrees with them.
