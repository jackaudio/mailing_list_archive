This would be awesome If i am understanding, what you are saying
correctly....If so, I already have a use-case for this;

When i load up my template-type keyboard/module session, ie: some
synths/linuxsamper(4 piano) + some plugins... On startup, Jack is set
to ignore all self-connect requests -> this is because some clients
will directly connect to the hardware outputs, while i need them to
only connect to other clients. (ie: let the session manager handle
connections, not the app/clients).

However, often i may be watching videos, while practicing and/or
taking an online music lesson, learning a song, playing along with
something on youtube, etc...(or even just watching a video like a t.v
show, while playing) In this situation, i want the video's sound to
self-connect, because the alternative is to manually connect them for
*every* video that i watch. :\

currently, i do connect the jack client (video/flash) manually ~ as it
beats having to connect *everything else* manually. But i will add
that 'it is a thorn in my side' and not ideal.. ;) I think it would be
great to be able to switch the self-connect behavior while everything
is running, rather than just on startup. it would make life easier...
This is a great idea :)
