&gt; Accidently, only replied to Paul, oops. re-posting to list.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; the proposal has some merits i think. i don't think its very useful
&gt;&gt; for most use cases, but in some reasonably likely ones, some of these
&gt;&gt; options would be very useful to have. it would integrate quite well
&gt;&gt; with JACK Session, and enables that and ladish to do what they want
&gt;&gt; without having to modify clients, which is a good thing. but ... to be
&gt;
&gt; +1
&gt;
&gt;&gt; actually useful, i suspect that this option needs to be controllable
&gt;&gt; in a running server, not just at startup.
&gt;
&gt; This would be awesome If i am understanding, what you are saying
&gt; correctly....If so, I already have a use-case for this;
&gt;
&gt; When i load up my template-type keyboard/module session, ie: some
&gt; synths/linuxsamper(4 piano) + some plugins... On startup, Jack is set
&gt; to ignore all self-connect requests -&gt; this is because some clients
&gt; will directly connect to the hardware outputs, while i need them to
&gt; only connect to other clients. (ie: let the session manager handle
&gt; connections, not the app/clients).
&gt;
&gt; However, often i may be watching videos, while practicing and/or
&gt; taking an online music lesson, learning a song, playing along with
&gt; something on youtube, etc...(or even just watching a video like a t.v
&gt; show, while playing) In this situation, i want the video's sound to
&gt; self-connect, because the alternative is to manually connect them for
&gt; *every* video that i watch. :\
&gt;
&gt; currently, i do connect the jack client (video/flash) manually ~ as it
&gt; beats having to connect *everything else* manually. But i will add
&gt; that 'it is a thorn in my side' and not ideal.. ;) I think it would be
&gt; great to be able to switch the self-connect behavior while everything
&gt; is running, rather than just on startup. it would make life easier...
&gt; This is a great idea :)

ladish restores connection to external clients. you have to connect them
only once, not on each restart. However if the client changes its jack
client name (for example by adding pid as suffix), ladish treats it as
different client and will not reconnect. There is alrady known
workaround for such apps that create [somewhat] random names. If you add
a shell as an app in ladish and you start apps from there, ladish will
know that this is the same client and will reconnect it, despite of the
real jack client name. As you probably already know, ladish uses app
name in this case.
