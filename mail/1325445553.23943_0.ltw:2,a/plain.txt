ladish restores connection to external clients. you have to connect them
only once, not on each restart. However if the client changes its jack
client name (for example by adding pid as suffix), ladish treats it as
different client and will not reconnect. There is alrady known
workaround for such apps that create [somewhat] random names. If you add
a shell as an app in ladish and you start apps from there, ladish will
know that this is the same client and will reconnect it, despite of the
real jack client name. As you probably already know, ladish uses app
name in this case.
