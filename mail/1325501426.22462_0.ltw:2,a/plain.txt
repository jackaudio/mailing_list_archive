Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Usage of jack_get_time()

Best wishes to all !

I'm working on an app that requires using jack_get_time() in
several threads. This function does not require a client*
argument.

During normal operation everything is OK. I'm trying to
handle the case where Jack kicks out my client.

1. Apparently jack_get_time() continues to work even if
the process is no longer a Jack client, allowing me to
shutdown cleanly.

2. OTOH, starting the threads using jack_get_time()
without being a Jack client leads to an immediate
segfault - just linking with libjack is not enough.

So I wonder how much I can count on (1), and what the
exact conditions for using jack_get_time() are.
