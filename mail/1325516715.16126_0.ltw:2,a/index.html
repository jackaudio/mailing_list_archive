Hi!

I've just noticed that there are two tickets on the trac:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/ticket/248
    Dummy driver behaves badly when system clock is adjusted backwards

This one applies to jackd1 only.

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/ticket/249
    example-clients/midiseq.c: note_starts is not assigned enough memory

This one applies to both, jackd1 and jackd2.


I've attached the corresponding patches to each ticket.


If you fix the issues in jackd1 and jackd2, please mention the
commit/revision that fixes it in each ticket. Of course, this is up to
you, but while working through my list of submitted jackd patches, I
came across #239. Knowing if this bug is still valid or not required me
to check the source again.

As said earlier last year, I'd love to see ticket changes
(open/close...) on the mailing list. My tracs (and also FFADO) create a
mail to the devel ML whenever somebody opens, closes or alters a ticket.
That's handy.

Same for mentioning revisions in tickets, this helps keeping track.


While we're at it: I'd also love to see the switch to git earlier than
later, so patches can be directly submitted to the ML, reviewed and
hopefully included.

That said, we should consider having branches for the header files
and/or for all common parts like the example-clients, the man pages and
maybe more. It sucks to double-check both code bases every time somebody
comes up with a patch.

If interested, I volunteer to open a project at repo.or.cz, github or my
own box, import the jackd1 svn to a jackd1 branch, import the jackd2 svn
to the jackd2 branch, create a header branch based on whatever you
prefer and also a common branch for example clients and manpages.

Alternatively, submodules with separate repos can be used if different
subdirectories are required between the different jackd implementations.

In the end, each implementor would do something like

    $ git merge headers
    $ git merge common

to its tree whenever necessary.


Cheers
