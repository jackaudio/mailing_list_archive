Yep.

repo.or.cz might be a good alternative, too.

If you prefer your own machine, maybe gitosis is helpful. Simply throw
in a bunch of ssh pubkeys and you're set. Gitolite is said to be even
better, but I've never used it myself.

I've prepared the repo based on what nedko did for jackd2. Maybe
somebody wants to have a look if I got it right:

   $ git clone http://adi.loris.tv/jackd


It's a combo-repo containing both, jackd1 and jackd2 and the
corresponding SVN tracking branches.


Once your server-side setup is ready, one would simply


   $ git push --mirror URL

the repo above and that's it.


Cheers
