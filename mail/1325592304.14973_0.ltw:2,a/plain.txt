I'd be happy to, provided someone can tell me _which_ changes
are wanted.

1. Add the functions to read current and next wakeup times
   separately, fix jack_frames_to_time().

   Options in that case:

   A. Change the jack_nframes_t parameter or result of jack_frame_time(),
      jack_frames_since_cycle_start(), jack_frames_to_time() and
      jack_time_to_frames() to a double to preserve full precision.

   B. Or add new versions keeping the current ones as deprecated.

   C. Fix the anomaly in jack_frames_since_cylce_start() which
      seems to use an unfiltered current_wakeup time, making
      it inconsistent with the rest of the timing functions. 

or

2. Add an atomic accessor for all four of current_wakeup_time,
   next_wakeup_time,  last_frame_time, and the current period
   time estimate of the DLL. This allows the client to do all
   calculations to full precision. Leave the other functions as
   the are as a client wanting full precision is not required
   to use them. Of course still fix jack_frames_to_time().

   Options in that case:

   A. Same as C above.

As a separate but related issue I'd like to review the DLL
code as I'm not convinced that the current implementation
provides full precision.

AFAIK, the decision is postponed until after the 'great
unification', so I'm not really motivated to write a patch
ATM.

OTOH, fixing the bug in jack_frames_to_time() just requires
a cut-and-paste of three lines (and testing it of course).      
You don't need a patch to do that.

Ciao,
