OK. I've started preparing a number of patches against jack1-0.121-3
implementing (2) above, and including a cleanup of the DLL code. The
work required on jack/internal.h, jackd/engine.c and part of libjack/
transclient.c is done. Remain some details in libjack/transclient.c,
extensive testing, and documentation in jack/jack.h. This will have
to wait until after the LAC deadline.

The patches do not introduce any binary or source incompatibility.
