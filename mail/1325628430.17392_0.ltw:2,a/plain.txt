Most probably the clues I got were wrong, maybe due to wrong ordering of the output due to buffering being different in all programs used. I finally traced the problem to a few un-initialized variables in a supercollider ugen (LR4 high pass and low pass filters used in the speaker crossover). Those were the cause of the big noises in the output stream. I still can't think how this could result in an audio port that stops working! Must be something inside alsa itself? Still puzzling. Still a lot more testing to do but it looks fine for now...

I'm very happy as well. And very sorry to have bothered you (and all 
jack developers) with it.

Although there is still a problem somewhere. How can a misbehaving 
application that is (I think) just feeding samples to jack, be able to 
shut down one or more jack channels in such a way that only a jack 
restart can get them working again?

Hmmmm, maybe I can use bitmeter to do some checks. I just thought that 
maybe those jack ports could be working just fine except that somehow 
the client is sending full scale DC to them, any other contribution from 
other ports does nothing as it is being clipped by jack. I will see if I 
can test this today.
