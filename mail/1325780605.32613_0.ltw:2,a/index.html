&gt;&gt; The D1 arrived today.  I installed it, built and booted a kernel with the
&gt;&gt; Xonar driver selected, and I'm pretty much blown away by the low latency.
&gt;&gt;   It works just fine with 16 F/P, 2 P/B, 192khz.  This translates to 0.167ms
&gt;&gt; latency.  Which is way lower than what I actually need and probably means a
&gt;&gt; solid performance at 64FP/2PB/48khz/2.67ms (the settings I actually use).
&gt;
&gt; what kernel are you using? what video interface? are you running in
&gt; duplex mode or playback only?

Kernel 3.1.7 (patched with BFS).  If with "video interface" you mean the 
graphics driver, that would be the "radeon" driver (with KMS). 
Playback-only mode; if I use duplex, every few seconds the sound goes 
away.  Lowering the sample rate to 96khz (0.333ms) seems to fix that and 
duplex mode works.

"threadirqs" kernel option is enabled.  I don't use some special desktop 
setup or anything; it's KDE 4.8 RC2 with compositing and all eye candy 
enabled.

Note that I *do* get XRUNs at 16FP/2PB/192khz.  But not too many; about 
20 per second or so while playing a 12 channel track in LMMS.  Compared 
to a few *thousand* XRUNs per second previously, I'd say that's quite an 
improvement ;-)
