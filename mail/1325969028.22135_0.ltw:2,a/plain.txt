Constructive or not, this is what I think about the proposal.

I'm _not at all_ in favour of adding functionality to Jack
that only serves to resolve problems created by application
authors who either by ignorance or by design do things they
shouldn't do, such as autoconnecting without providing an
option to configure or disable it.

Doing this only encourages the creation or continued acceptance
of apps that don't behave as required. The correct course of
action is to discourage the same, and force app authors to
either do their homework or face being excluded.

Apart from these objections, the proposal as formulated seems
rather and ad-hoc way to solve the particular LADISH problems 
instead of being a more general way to enhance Jack's features.
For one, it completely ignores the difference between inputs
and outputs - an app autoconnecting its inputs doesn't do any
harm except possibly to itself. Also making a connection request
fail without generating an error is a 100% sure recipe for future
problems - it basically makes it impossible for any app dealing
with connections to behave in any defined and rational way.

Ciao,
