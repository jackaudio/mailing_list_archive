&gt; It's a different situation here. An option to reject auto-connections
&gt; will break a working system here.

As a user, I don't really like delving into dev discussions, but I couldn't
stop myself here. It's an *option*. How can an option break your system if
you don't explicitly turn it on? I don't recall anyone suggesting that this
should be default behaviour in JACK.

PS: Again! What apps do auto-connect and don't provide a switch to
&gt; disable it?
&gt;

Two that come to mind are PD and Din. Do you consider these to be "borked
apps"? Maybe they do have an option to turn off self-connect and I just
haven't found it. Personally I use the patched version of jack because it
guarantees that I have control at the session level, and not at the app
level. I don't have to check each and every app to see if it auto-connects
or not, or to check whether such auto-connection is optional. So I really
don't care now, as a user, if apps auto connect or not because I have a
centralized option to ignore them all. The simple fact is, at the moment,
from a user perspective, self-connect behaviour in JACK apps is not
consistent, and Nedko's patch is the most convenient tool to make it so.

Regardless of any technical or design problems of the patch, which I am in
no place to debate, or the politics of getting the patch into mainline
JACK, which I have no interest in, I am thankful to Nedko for developing
the patch and making my user experience with Linux audio more enjoyable.
