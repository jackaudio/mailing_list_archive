It's not a matter of 'purity'. What you call 'purity' is just an
other form a pragmatism - one that takes a longer term and pro-
active view rather than a short-term and merely reactive one.

Application developers will just bypass the autoconnect restriction
which is trivially easy. Just call system ("jack_connect ....") or
create a second Jack client within the app to do the connections.

This sort of hack is not a real solution to what _may_ be real
problem (and I'm not even convinced of the latter). And if any
app can block connections of others, even make them fail silently, 
that creates a situation in which other software can't be made
to work correctly.
