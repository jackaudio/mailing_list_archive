you mean the delta hardware allows this kind of setting, with standard 
drivers? interesting, i thought 32 would be pretty much a universal 
hardware limit...
interesting to know for scientific applications.

btw, just to set things straight before people go crazy over-optimizing 
their music setups: a piano has a non-constant systemic latency from 2-3 
ms, an acoustic drumkit is probably between 1 and 3 ms, and nobody has 
ever complained :)
