Abandon Squeeze and update to sid (unstable). Everything is there. Or
tell your package manager to load some packages from unstable.

You're really looking for the debian-user mailing list.

    $ man apt_preferences

or use Google how to pull in packages from unstable into squeeze. It
boils down to modifying your sources.list and then to say something like

    $ apt-get install jackd2/unstable

That's it.
