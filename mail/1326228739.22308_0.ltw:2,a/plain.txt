I just discovered something that is probably worth mentioning.  In LMMS, 
there's an additional setting that affects latency: "Buffer size".  I 
wrongly thought that this settings only affects the ALSA backend.  It 
was set to 512 frames (11.6ms).  I assumed this was a setting that told 
LMMS how to open the ALSA device (hw:0) and that it had no effect when 
using the JACK backend.

I assumed wrong.  It's weird that I didn't figure this out a lot sooner 
(I remember playing around with this setting.)  But this *does* have an 
effect even when using JACK.  So I was adding 11.6ms to my total latency 
and didn't even know it :-P  So I turned that down to its minimum 
setting (64 frames, 1.5ms) and now I indeed can't tell the difference 
between 2.67ms and 5.33ms (or even 10.7ms) in JACK.

That was quite stupid of me.  Fortunately, getting the new soundcard 
wasn't a total waste of money; it's better in video games than the 
onboard sound (Dolby Headphone actually works :-P)  (It's also 
*supposed* to have better sound quality, but I don't know about that; 
never bothered to ABX it.)
