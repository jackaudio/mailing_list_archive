Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] The Situation(s) With JACK

so, moving along, it seems that the first steps (very tiny baby steps)
to resolving all this stuff involve finding a way to make the header
files and common example and utility clients shareable by any
implementation. the obvious solution to this involves putting them
into a repository in some special way, or putting them in a special
repository.

i've looked at git submodules and they seem roughly OK for this task,
but also to have some complications and potential risks. i don't even
begin to claim to know enough about git or svn or SCM systems in
general to identify the best way to go about doing this, but i have a
feeling that someone else on this list does.

so please comment: what is the best way to put the header files that
define the JACK API, along with the source code for the
example+utility clients somewhere that any implementation of the API
could use them?
