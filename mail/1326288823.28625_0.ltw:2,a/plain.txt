I'm also not a big fan of submodules. How about the following:


    jack-common --> independent repo
      + headers --> branch in jack-common with the header files
      + tools
      + example-clients
      + manpages

The last three are also branches of the jack-common repo.

The real jackd repositories:

    jackd1   --> independent repo
    jackd2   --> independent repo

It doesn't really matter if it's one repo with two branches or two
repos, but I guess the latter is more convenient to use. Correct me if
I'm wrong.

The jackd developer would now and then do

    $ git pull jack-common headers

to update their *local copy* of header files the current trunk (master)
is based on.

Same for example-clients, tools and the lot. It's not even necessary
those things reside on different branches, but it gives the jackd
developer the opportunity to update example-clients, tools, headers and
man pages individually (no idea if this is required).

Coordination required: jackd1 and jackd probably need to agree on three
or four common subdirectories in their repositories, that is, include/,
tools/, example-clients/, man/. Not a big deal, requires some minor
updates to the build system.


This could all happen in parallel with the existing svn repos, if
needed.
