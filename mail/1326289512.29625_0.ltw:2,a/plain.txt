I'd completely split off the example clients and tools: if these are apps
they should be compiled *as applications*, that is using the installed
headers instead of those from the repo, and have their own manpages.

Also manpages for the server could be different for jack1 and jack2 so
these probably belong with their own version and not in common.

That leaves just the headers and the API docs in the common repo.
