It drives me bonkers the way GNU / Linux devs split things up. LV2 is 
the worst offender I can think of; Dave Robillard's single SVN 
repository is a huge step in the right direction.

I have a radical suggestion: Put everything into one repository. (Except 
it's not *that* radical: the kernel did this a few years ago, putting 
i386 and x86_64 into a single arch tree, x86.)

As a user, I either do svn co / up, or git clone / pull. Which version 
gets compiled becomes a configure-time option:

./waf configure --prefix=/usr --alsa --ffado --version=(1|2)

./waf configure fails if a version is not specified.

(This would mean Jack1 should switch to waf.) If there are apps I don't 
want compiled, then I can specify them just as painfully as with any 
other build system. (Was that zero, one or two hypens? experimental=0? 
Or --no-experimental?)

If this will cause a lot of immediate breakage, then it should be done 
over the weekend of the LAD conference in April. Make it into a big code 
sprint. Whatever coders are there, who haven't hacked on Jack yet, 
should get into the code and see if there's anything they can do to help.
