&gt; one click? i'm confused. i'm a developer, working on my machine using
&gt; various git(1) tools. what does "1 click" have to do with anything?

That depends on how easy you want to make it for other people to also
get involved.

&gt; from what i read about things like gitolite, its not very hard to set
&gt; up a flexible, useful git server anywhere one wants it to be.

Sure, but the folks at Github have already done that and added a couple
of man years of work on adding extra features beyond just gitolite.

&gt;&gt; up READMEs are a delight. Yes I know that the structure of whatever
&gt;&gt; repo is used is the hard part, but after that hurdle, using Github
&gt;&gt; would help coordinate and accelerate future development.
&gt;
&gt; you think that issues with SCM have been holding back jack development?

Now that you put it like that, frankly, yes. Not in the past because
systems like Github were not available but going forward... definitely
a preempted "yes".
