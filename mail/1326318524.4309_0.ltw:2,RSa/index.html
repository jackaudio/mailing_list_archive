You are both right.

Of course, git remains distributed, so Paul could stick to his
gitolite-based repo on jackaudio.org.

Anybody else can *also* push this to github, and updates Paul does will
end up there, too.

Likewise, if collaboration with unknown people on the net really
happens, Paul can always pull in these changes. Everything is
everywhere.


I never bothered to look at github in the past, but I recently had to a
couple of weeks ago. It seems absolutely amazing how it simplifies
working with others. One of the coolest features:

    https://github.com/blog/42-commit-comments

If others come up with patches, one can comment on each line why it is
good or not.

They also provide a ticket system and a wiki. (read: this could replace
most of the current infrastructure, if desired[0])

I haven't done anything on github, yet, but it definitely looks neat.

And given the nature of git, it will happen anyway. Somebody will push
it to github, and one day, you'll receive an email saying "I've fixed
foo, please pull from my github repo."

So it's either you or Mark who'll be the first with a git repo on
github. ;)


&gt; one click? i'm confused. i'm a developer, working on my machine using
&gt; various git(1) tools. what does "1 click" have to do with anything?

One could argue that it's easier to discuss patches on the mailinglist
like the Linux kernel guys do. Others believe the web interface offers
more features. I guess I'd be fine with both, as said earlier, I've
never tried github myself.

[0] Ask yourself if you (a) want to code or (b) spend time fixing broken
tracs. Unless there's a compelling reason for (b), I'd always go for (a)
these days. No strong feelings, though.
