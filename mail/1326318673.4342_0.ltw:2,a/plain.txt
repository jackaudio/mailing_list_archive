Subject:     [Jack-Devel] porting jack to android

Hi all,
thanks for all the good  work on jack,
I use it for almost a year now to record audio with ardour at home,
and recently take is to rehearshal and on stage.
It works almost always perfectly, after getting used to it and some
finetuning.

But for the live performanc,
monitoring is quite important for the singer, gitarist etc,
so I was considering in-ear-monitoring,
because it seems to work really good,
but the devices are about 170 euro each,
and then I was playing and reading about netjack,
and thinking, heh if it could work on android devices over the wifi,
woud be the perfect solution.
Monitoring is not as critical with regards to dropouts
as wireless instruments or voice.

I did read a recent post on your mailing list about android,
what would be the use of porting it,
well, for me that would be this,
Thanks and greetings Arthur
