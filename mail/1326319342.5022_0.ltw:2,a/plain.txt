ACK.

ACK.

ACK.

So to sum this up, it's either a common subdirectory naming or git
submodules, and you prefer git submodules.

Nothing to argue with that from my point. Anyone else?


Let me try to rephrase the difference:

With git submodules, each implementation can place the header files in
any directory, maybe include/ on jackd1 and headers/ on jackd2.

With direct merges, we have to agree to call it either include/ *OR*
header/.

Sounds sane to me. All my names were only placeholders. If nobody
objects, let's call it jack-shared then.

What do you propose?
