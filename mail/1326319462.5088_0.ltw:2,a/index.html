&gt; Hi all,
&gt; thanks for all the good  work on jack,
&gt; I use it for almost a year now to record audio with ardour at home,
&gt; and recently take is to rehearshal and on stage.
&gt; It works almost always perfectly, after getting used to it and some
&gt; finetuning.
&gt;
&gt; But for the live performanc,
&gt; monitoring is quite important for the singer, gitarist etc,
&gt; so I was considering in-ear-monitoring,
&gt; because it seems to work really good,
&gt; but the devices are about 170 euro each,
&gt; and then I was playing and reading about netjack,
&gt; and thinking, heh if it could work on android devices over the wifi,
&gt; woud be the perfect solution.
&gt; Monitoring is not as critical with regards to dropouts
&gt; as wireless instruments or voice.
&gt;
&gt; I did read a recent post on your mailing list about android,
&gt; what would be the use of porting it,
&gt; well, for me that would be this,

Android doesn't support realtime operation and the dalvik vm requires
Java. It is possible to port jack to android as a system app but you will
need to build your own version of the OS possibly working from
Cyanogenmod. Some devices can run a version of Ubuntu on top of android
but I haven't heard of anyone trying to run jack in that scenario.

Google engineers have been extremely slack at dealing with the realtime
issue and by the looks of it will not make any real progress for a while.
Possibly this is being done deliberately. Because they have had a few
years to get it right with plenty of resources at their disposal and
haven't managed to yet.

If you want to run JACK on a portable device you will have better luck
getting a standard x86 OS onto it. The new direction from Intel and AMD in
low power chipsets bodes well for this eventuality. Indamixx provide a
couple of portable solutions that you might find work for you too.


Cheers
