Android doesn't support realtime operation and the dalvik vm requires
Java. It is possible to port jack to android as a system app but you will
need to build your own version of the OS possibly working from
Cyanogenmod. Some devices can run a version of Ubuntu on top of android
but I haven't heard of anyone trying to run jack in that scenario.

Google engineers have been extremely slack at dealing with the realtime
issue and by the looks of it will not make any real progress for a while.
Possibly this is being done deliberately. Because they have had a few
years to get it right with plenty of resources at their disposal and
haven't managed to yet.

If you want to run JACK on a portable device you will have better luck
getting a standard x86 OS onto it. The new direction from Intel and AMD in
low power chipsets bodes well for this eventuality. Indamixx provide a
couple of portable solutions that you might find work for you too.


Cheers
