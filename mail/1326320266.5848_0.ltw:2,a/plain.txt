You don't need netjack. Use an ordinary UDP streamer, jack.udp jumps to
my mind. I have a multicast-enabled jack.udp, just in case you're
interested. You'd probably need to resample on the playback device.

Nice add-on: stream n channels at once and mix on the android. Personal
monitor mix for every phone user at constant data rate.

Wifi is not exactly helpful, but maybe it's good enough if you're not
aiming for ultra-low latency.

Final note: I've once plugged my $1500 in-ear monitoring into my laptop,
and pulseaudio has this weird "noise-on-last-client-exiting" bug. It was
an utterly painful experience, I was half-deaf for maybe an hour.

So if you really really dare to do in-ear monitoring on Android, make
sure it will not blow away your ears, no incoming call, calendar
reminder or whatsoever that could possibly chime in at high levels.

Unless you cannot guarantee this (master-volume?), I'd always add an
external limiter between phone and headphones.
