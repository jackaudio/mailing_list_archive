Let me add a link to back this statement:

    https://github.com/features/projects


git-powered wikis that can handle roff. As in "Here's the manpage, and
feel free to fix it if you want."

At work, we've abandoned CMS and directly push to a git repository. A
node.js-based template engine then styles everything. No SQL database,
no PHP, no apache. Everyone can run the whole website from his laptop,
including full version history and branching to test new features, if
necessary.

Maybe that's why I like a wiki that uses a git backend.
