Did you test it because that would be a unique implementation if it
performs well.

Dalvik and audioflinger don't support realtime audio on any device that
anyone here has tested and that is pretty much every android device.  If
anything the situation is getting worse over time as the manufacturers are
choosing to increase latency in order to achieve better sound stability in
their ROM builds.

Cyanogenmod team have added a workaround to their audio API which provides
direct access to the pcm device but that blocks everything else when
running. The situation with Android is like the a Linux desktop in 1998.
It works if you don't want to do anything professional but if you do it
requires making some compromises and jumping through hoops.

Why they chose to go this route when all this was worked out several years
ago is beyond comprehension.

They clearly have an idiot or "AVID sell out"  driving the audio
implementation at Google HQ ;-)
