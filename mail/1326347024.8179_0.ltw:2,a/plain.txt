Totaly agree. The main downside of submodules is that they track a
certain committed snapshot rather than master unlike svn:externals
which automatically tracks trunk. However, a submodule tracking a
snapshot is a useful feature and I'm confident the ability to easily
track a moving master, or any, branch will come soon.
