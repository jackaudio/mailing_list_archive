Hi Patrick,

you are totally right,
I did look it up and it was an ipad, iphone etc app,
I just was thinking phone app,
and was not really interest.

but I have thought about another set-up,
I have a ardour and jack and stream that to  a local webserver,
that streams it as radiostation website,
the phone, logs into the wifi, and goes to the intra website.
nothing to install at the phone client side

But if the latency is as bad as you describe,
it might still not work.


But one off singers has an iphone
and even for the audience it could work,


Greetings Arthur

&gt; &gt; Well,
&gt; &gt; I forgot to mention,
&gt; &gt; I was in a music store and they sold an
&gt; &gt; app and usb cable,
&gt; &gt; to get your android into a guitar FX,
&gt; &gt; so it should be quite like realtime.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Did you test it because that would be a unique implementation if it
&gt; performs well.
&gt;
&gt; Dalvik and audioflinger don't support realtime audio on any device that
&gt; anyone here has tested and that is pretty much every android device.  If
&gt; anything the situation is getting worse over time as the manufacturers are
&gt; choosing to increase latency in order to achieve better sound stability in
&gt; their ROM builds.
&gt;
&gt; Cyanogenmod team have added a workaround to their audio API which provides
&gt; direct access to the pcm device but that blocks everything else when
&gt; running. The situation with Android is like the a Linux desktop in 1998.
&gt; It works if you don't want to do anything professional but if you do it
&gt; requires making some compromises and jumping through hoops.
&gt;
&gt; Why they chose to go this route when all this was worked out several years
&gt; ago is beyond comprehension.
&gt;
&gt; They clearly have an idiot or "AVID sell out"  driving the audio
&gt; implementation at Google HQ ;-)
