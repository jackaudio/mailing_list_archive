Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] porting jack to android

Hi Patrick,

you are totally right,
I did look it up and it was an ipad, iphone etc app,
I just was thinking phone app,
and was not really interest.

but I have thought about another set-up,
I have a ardour and jack and stream that to  a local webserver,
that streams it as radiostation website,
the phone, logs into the wifi, and goes to the intra website.
nothing to install at the phone client side

But if the latency is as bad as you describe,
it might still not work.


But one off singers has an iphone
and even for the audience it could work,


Greetings Arthur
