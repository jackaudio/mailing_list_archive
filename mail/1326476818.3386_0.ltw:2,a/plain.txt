Its a perfectly excellent device, and is just as state of the art as
anything you could buy today unless you really need a matrix mixer
(most people don't). This is one of the benefits of a "modular"
approach to equipment - although there are A/D-D/A units today that
were not available when the 9636 was first released, both the old and
the new ones all work with the 9636. there is absolutely nothing
substandard in the 9636 at all.

JACK h/w monitoring is basically a waste of time unless you happy to
be one of the lucky few who can really benefit from 1:1 monitoring
(i.e. channel 1 input is monitored on channel 1 output). The actual
operation is done by configuring the RME card, at the request of a
given JACK client. But for most people its not flexible enough. Useful
for simple recording setups, perhaps. Not much more.

Let’s say I do have 24Bit/48kHz on my first eight ADAT inputs, but I will monitor all on SPDIF Out (be it by --hwmon or via qjackctl), but this SPDIF DA converter only is 16Bit/48kHz capable, would this work, without any intermediate software? Just jack(ctl) and the card?

i'm not 100% certain about this, but there is really only 1 sample
rate on the entire card, and the S/PDIF output will run at the same
rate as the rest of the channels. its vaguely possible that the S/PDIF
outs can sync separately and the h/w may do some kind of rate
conversion but i don't recall this as a feature of the original
hammerfall series.

you want hdspconf.

the settings can all be adjusted from the command line with amixer,
which provides full access to every parameter in any ALSA supported
device. but hdspconf is the GUI app that makes this simpler for hdsp
users.
