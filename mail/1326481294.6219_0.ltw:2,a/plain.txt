Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Controlling jack from command line

Hi everyone,

I just started using jack and qjackctl to connect my USB keyboard to aeolus (organ synthesizer program) and aeolus to my system's audio card. This works well, but it's a bit time-consuming to do this every time I start up aeolus. What I would like to do is write a shell script that will start jackd, then aeolus, then make all the necessary connections in jack. I'm assuming that this is possible, but I haven't been able to find any examples on Google or to make enough sense of the man page to proceed. Any suggestions?

Many thanks,
John
