The card will very likely send 24bit samples, however, since your DA
can handle S/PDIF, it is supposed to cope with 24bit input (16-24bits,
according to the spec)

I've never heard of any S/PDIF device that was limited to 16bit input.
If you know for sure that your DA will refuse to work with a word length
higher than 16, then use a loopback cable, the meterbridge tool and a
generator to reveal your card's resolution.
