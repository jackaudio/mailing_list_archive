Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] RME Digi9636 and jack usage (long)

Thanks very much for your time and replies.

Please let me conclude:

hw Monitoring using jack is 1:1 by default, so the signal of ADAT1 in will always be "mirrored" to ADAT Out 1, ADAT 2 in to ADAT2 out, SPDIF in on SPDIF out. That helped a lot for understanding. 

Hence, there is no way of having a sum of all ADAT Inputs on SPDIF out. So, there is nothing to configure and if I do want a master mix on SPDIF Out I'll have to use qjackctl or thelike.
That did help a lot.  

For the samplerate: It is the same all over. 48kHz. Just, my ADAT AD converters will digitize with 24 Bit, however the SPDIF converter in spe, a Midiman Flying Calf, only has a 16 or 20 Bit DA converter. 

As I have understood, the RME will send a 24Bit signal to spdif out, however, the Flying Cow converter will silently drop the lower 4/8 Bit. 
But there will most likely be no issues as there would be when trying to use different  samplerates - which actually would not work. But the bitrate should not be timing relevant, I just lose dynamics. As opposed to the samplerate. Worth a try, that's what I take home. 

I've tried hdsp conf, it refuses to work with my card, caliming "No Hammerfall DSP card found". What is in fact a correct statement - no DSP here. 

I've tried amixer, but there is quite a lot output that does not make any sense to me (yet). Giving the specs of the card, I am not even closely able to relate "Front left, Front Right..." or "Simple mixer control 'Passthru',0" to anything on the card. 

But this is surely just me. However, none of the items suggest a "non-audio" or "emphasis bit" setting. Not dramatic, I was just curious as for foreseeable future I will only need one ADAT input and my SPDIF as monitor output. Or'll get an ADAT DA converter and do hw monitoring with my mixing console - wasted money though.

Again thanks for your help, I now have an idea what I can buy and what risk may be left. The rest is usual trial and error
