Here we go, just ignore and close the hint and do not jump to their new site:

http://www.rme-audio.de/old/english/hammer/d9636.htm

Those are the pre HDSP models, which do not work with the hdspconf provided by alsa tools. 
Though in fact mine is actually identified as 9652, but I haven't got the addon card. 
Still no DSP, so no hardware downmix for monitoring, which is not a big deal; the latencies this card is supposed to be capable of will do a sufficient monitoring with qjackctl routing for me. Or so I do hope for now at least.
