Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack_wait not found, need to wait for jackd before alsa_in, alsa_out

When starting the slave side of a NetJACK2 system, I find that
sometimes when starting "jackd -R -d net ..." and then starting
alsa_in and alsa_out, the latter two complain that the JACK
server is not running.  I think I saw some documentation said to
do a "sleep 1", but that does not appear to suffice.  This is
using JACK version 1.9.6 in Mageia 1 on the slave side and JACK
version 1.9.7 in Tiny Core Linux on the master side.  On the
Mageia slave side, I see a man page for jack_wait, but that
command is not available.

Is there a better wait to wait for jackd to be available?  Should
jack_wait be available?  Is it the best way to wait for jackd to
be available?

Thanks,

Robert
