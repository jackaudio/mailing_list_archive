Subject:     [Jack-Devel] 2 questions

I have Jack installed on a win7 64 bit machine.  I can see my 32 bit apps in Jack control (except Ninjam).  I can't see Jackrouter in my 64 bit apps.  Any news on a 64 bit Jack?  Also, any idea why I can't see Ninjam in Jack Control?  Appreciate your assistance!
