Should be fixed now. r4705 is shown. We will have to wait for another
commit to see if it updates properly.

The problem was with the trac svn cache. The cache can be updated
manually through "trac-admin resync" but is also being updated upon HTTP
requests, when trac detects that repo revision has changed. The cache
update code is not well protected from race conditions.
