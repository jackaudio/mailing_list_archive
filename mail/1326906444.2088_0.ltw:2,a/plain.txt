More latency?  Between what and what?

JACK does not add any latency "between applications" that is : let a sequence IN ==> A ==> B ==> C ==> OUT of 3 applications, then for a given audio cycle, the input buffer will be received and treated by application A, then application B, then C. Assuming A, B, C do not add latency, the chain of activations will not add any latency.
