Hi Paul, Stephane,

I'll try to describe what I did.

As you may know (I posted some time back) Jack 1.9.8 x64 solved my very strange problem with Independence 3pro here, as this super sampler CANNOT USE ASIO4ALL though it sees it and accepts it.
Is the only (standalone) app that does that. I see the red X in Asio's panel and hear no sound though its GUI level meters workin'
So, I worked with as VSTi in Reaper. Also 3pro installs the appropriate version without letting the user decide if he wants the 32bit in a 64OS (like Inde 2.5.5) > use Jack 1.9.7 ;-)
With the revolutionary 1.9.8 x64 & 86 I simply select Jackrouter and voila I got a super standalone INDE pro and its Live version too.

But, .... latency ..... I connect Motif ES6 with USB(native) > lap > Jackrouter (Asio) > Inde .
Nothing else. 

I feel the latency in my fingers when comparing to Motif>Reaper>Inde VST.
It is noticeable. Maybe my settings ?

Also tried Motif>Inde>ReaRoute>Reaper. Like the VST chain no difference.
So I presume Jack is a bit slower?
Possibly my mistake. Maybe because Jack's default buffer is 512?

Best
Panos

What does this mean? JACK itself adds no latency at all ...
