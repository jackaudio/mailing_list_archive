Thanks.  Am I following you that Jackrouter showed up as a driver in Reaper 64 bit version no problem?

Hi Warren,


Here I'm on 64bit win7.
Main DAW Reaper 4 (now 4.15 official and 4.16pre unofficial) main 64bit.
A second Reaper 4.14 x86 for some 32bit apps. (I don't like bridging...)

Jack 1.9.8 for windows the 64 and 32bit version as Stephane linked to us.


My EWQL symphonic orch is a native 64bit here, along with Independence 3pro.
Symphonic choirs are 32bit (old Kompakt version), GrandOrgue is a 32bit app.
SIR2 and Lexicon native PCM 32bit and Origami 64bit



All mixed smoothly with the above Jack 1.9.8


To be honest, as a Reaper fanatic, I'm also using ReaRoutAsio which is a charm , but when goin' down to 128 buffers at 24/48000 I get cracks from some apps. (no Reaper's problem)

Intel T440 dual core 2.2GHz 4GBram standard Sata HDD at 5.900rpm.


With Jack there's no crack at all though it goes with a little more latency than ReaRoute.


So for those hard apps Jack is saving my day, or night if you prefere, as in a live performance I don't want cracks on sound.
I'm using ReaRoute (with cracks) when recording (usually midi first) and then I raise buffers to 2048 to do the audio mix for my recording sessions.


So this 1.9.8 Jack version, works with all 64bit apps (and are many) I got.


Also, as you see, I cannot go without Jack, even If I like ReaRoute too ! :-D


Best
Panos

Spoke to some Cubase folks.  I think the confusion lies in that Jack will run on a 64 bit system but will not work with 64 bit applications (I.e. Cubase 6).  Most seem to recommend using Reaper's alternative (ReaRoute) instead of Jack.  Please keep me posted if there is a new version of Jack to be released or if I have any incorrect info.  Thanks again.  Regards,

> Thanks.  I had assumed the reason I saw Jackrouter in every app except my 64 bit Cubase was a 64 bit Jack limitation.  If you have not seen/heard of anything like this before I'll troubleshoot through my Cubase app.  

Yes please do.


> Please let me know at your convenience.  Thank you again.

Any log file to provide?


Thanks..
