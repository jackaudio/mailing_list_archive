Hi Stephane,

Maybe I didn't explain fully.

Motif is the Yamaha Motif ES-6 music production synthesizer model 2003 Oct.
A hardware DAW if you like with a powerfull sampler and synthesizer... then :-)
Now with super CPUs and standard 24/48000 things are gone beyond imagination.

So I'm using Motif as Keyboard and sometimes mixer or audio source of sounds, controller to my lap which is loaded with more than 1000 instruments inside with just a dual core Intel....

No Asio in Motif of course, but its USB connection is extremely stable and fast. Never had a stuck when playing with Motif as controller.


I don't have an external audio card, so I'm depending on Asio4all v2.10 and the on board RealTek card tuned to 24/48000. It has a line in too.


Jack for me is like the old DI boxes we used on stage. I plugged in my instrument then the routing started.
I'm not used to HQ studio stuff (like is Reaper today) on stage or live play at home or elsewhere, so I'm feeling more confortable with desktop>Jack control>one to three instruments & effects for this.

Recording (and I'm doing a lot..) is something else and there too Jack has other possibilities.

@Warren, Yes Reaper x64 "sees" Jackrouter. As Hauptwerk 4 x64, EWQL SO, UVI2, Kontakt5, Independence 3, Engine 2.1, Linuxsampler 20111216 , Savihost x64, VSTHost x64, Cantabile x64 and the list goes on.

I didn't engaged rgsvr32 from system32, but I opened command prompt to type for registering the 64bit dll. All OK from the first experimental 1.9.8 Stephane uploaded. For some reason Win7 remember it. Also I have long ago shut down my UAC. It messes around and I don't like that. :-)


So, can we go to 256 48000 with Jack 1.9.8 on windows with Asio4All?
Here all connections say 512/44100 default, no other options when Jack is on.
And Jack wins here too because if one tries any other app and sets 512/44100 the latency is awfull, with Jack, no.... OK for my fingers there is a difference when open a HQ app which can go to 6ms latency on my system, but we can't have it all, no?

Unless I'm missing something in the paths of our quest that has being discussed sometime back !
If so, sorry about that. I must re-read and re-study.

Best
Panos

So you are using -d ASIO::ASIO4all v2 to access the Motif ES6 with USB ? Why that? Can'' you use the ASIO driver  of the Motif ES6 directly? (in case there is one...)
