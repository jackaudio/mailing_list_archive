Hi Stephane,
That's it : SOLVED !!
Though there's something to report (error 1552)

Good news first.
Your post opened the light, so I opened Jackportaudio. Clicked on the right down (hidden icons) to open Asio4all panel. Read 512.
Change here to 256, blue rib stays on 512. RealTek's background on the list above becomes white from blue.
I click on RealTek > blue again.
Close Asio4all's panel from X
Close Jack.
Clicking on the right down (hidden icons) I see Asio's green icon for a second or two then closes.
Then I open Jack's properties I change -b 512 to -b 256 and I add -r 48.000 save OK and close.
Opened again Jackportaudio > see Asio panel : 256 !
Open Independence 3 (already on Jackrouter from first installation) play and... YES, now we're taklin'.

Jack though reports contiuously the following message without any disturb on my sound :

AvSetMmTreadCharacteristics error : 1552

It doesn't stop running but it doesn't affect any sound , so I'm fine. Is this normal?

I went and set 128...... he he It works but my OS gave some small cracks not much but it gave :-|

Thank you very much for that answer. I was doin' it backwards .......all this time :-/

all the best
Panos

I was thinking buffers setup has to be done in Asio4All itself no? (so setup a buffer buffer size in Asio4All then use the same in Jack setup.)
