Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack and bluetooth?

Hello All,

I just got a jawbone jambox bluetooth device and was trying to find a
jack application to connect to this bluetooth device and play audio
from jack.  I seem to be at a dead end with that search for a
solution.  I see that pulseaudio is bluetooth enabled out of the box
but on my system, jack and pulseaudio never played well together.
Meaning that pulseaudio always crashed.  Anyone have a solution?

thanks,
jason
