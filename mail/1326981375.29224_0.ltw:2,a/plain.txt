Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jackrouter ASIO driver / channel IDs

I use a RME HDSP digiface. It has 26 channels, 3x8 ADAT and 1xSPDIF stereo, the SPDIF is connected to my monitors via a DAC/Amp.
 
When I run for example Ableton Live 8 and I set its audio preferences to only activate out channels 25/26 and set Lives Master to out to channels 25/26, I hear lives Master.
 
Now I use Jackaudio and qjackctl. I set up Ableton Live to use Jackrouter ASIO driver (with its Jackrouter.ini changed to 26 I/O channels) and activated ALL 26 channels in Lives Setup.

I ran qjackctl and created a patchbay which routes Lives 26 channels to the 26 portaudios system channels, so Live out1 goes to RME HDSP digiface 1, out2 goes to DF2 and so on. So, when I set Lives Master to out to Jackrouters channels 25/26, I hear Lives Master at my monitors, like when I use the RME ASIO driver. Fine.
 
When I now deactivate ALL channels but the channels 25/26 in Live8, the Jackrouter ASIO driver does NOT send audio out channels 25/26! Instead, it only opens ONE channel pair out1/2, which the qjackctl patchbay routes to the RME ASIO HDSP channels 1/2.
 
Again: the Jackrouter ASIO driver does NOT open the specified channels (here channels 25/26), but always opens channels sequentially starting with the first channel 1.
 
Thus, the routing changes whenever a app opens/closes ASIO channels. As there are quite a few apps, which opens available channels only when needed (in order to save system ressources) this lead to a routing mess using Jackaudio/Jackrouter on Win...
 
Can this be sorted out?
