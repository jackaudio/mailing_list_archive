Le 19 janv. 2012 &#xE0; 14:55, Markus Kraft a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; I use a RME HDSP digiface. It has 26 channels, 3x8 ADAT and 1xSPDIF stereo, the SPDIF is connected to my monitors via a DAC/Amp.
&gt; 
&gt; When I run for example Ableton Live 8 and I set its audio preferences to only activate out channels 25/26 and set Lives Master to out to channels 25/26, I hear lives Master.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I use Jackaudio and qjackctl. I set up Ableton Live to use Jackrouter ASIO driver (with its Jackrouter.ini changed to 26 I/O channels) and activated ALL 26 channels in Lives Setup.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran qjackctl and created a patchbay which routes Lives 26 channels to the 26 portaudios system channels, so Live out1 goes to RME HDSP digiface 1, out2 goes to DF2 and so on. So, when I set Lives Master to out to Jackrouters channels 25/26, I hear Lives Master at my monitors, like when I use the RME ASIO driver. Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; When I now deactivate ALL channels but the channels 25/26 in Live8, the Jackrouter ASIO driver does NOT send audio out channels 25/26! Instead, it only opens ONE channel pair out1/2, which the qjackctl patchbay routes to the RME ASIO HDSP channels 1/2.

Yes since only 2 active channels were requested by the application.  

&gt; 
&gt; Again: the Jackrouter ASIO driver does NOT open the specified channels (here channels 25/26), but always opens channels sequentially starting with the first channel 1.

Well is is possibly only a naming issue: JackRouter ASIO driver gives names to active JACK ports starting from 0. But since the effective active number is given by the application, it should be possible to name them correctly; so you would see : in25, in26, out25 out26 (instead of in0, in1, out0 out1). Would it be correct?

&gt; 
&gt; Thus, the routing changes whenever a app opens/closes ASIO channels. As there are quite a few apps, which opens available channels only when needed (in order to save system ressources) this lead to a routing mess using Jackaudio/Jackrouter on Win...
&gt; 
&gt; Can this be sorted out?
