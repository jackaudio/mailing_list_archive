So, when I set Lives Master to out to Jackrouters channels 25/26, I hear Lives Master at my monitors, like when I use the RME ASIO driver. Fine.

Yes since only 2 active channels were requested by the application.

Well is is possibly only a naming issue: JackRouter ASIO driver gives names to active JACK ports starting from 0. But since the effective active number is given by the application, it should be possible to name them correctly; so you would see : in25, in26, out25 out26 (instead of in0, in1, out0 out1). Would it be correct?
