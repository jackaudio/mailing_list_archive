Subject:     [Jack-Devel] cross-compilation from linux to windows using the mingw-w64 toolchain

Hi.

I am attempting to build jack-1.9.8 for windows using the mingw-w64 toolchain on a linux (Ubuntu) desktop.
Does anyone have information as to how to configure waf for this to work?
So far, I have tried the following script.

#!/bin/bash

export DEST_PLATFORM=win32;
export CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc; 
export CFLAGS=-I/home/martin/Build/include; 
export CPP=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc; 
export CXX=i686-w64-mingw32-g++; 
export AR=i686-w64-mingw32-ar; 
export NM=i686-w64-mingw32-nm; 
export RANLIB=i686-w64-mingw32-ranlib; 
export STRIP=i686-w64-mingw32-strip; 
waf configure


However, this fails because waf tries to compile linux-specific code.
I get the following error:

../linux/JackLinuxTime.c:30:22: fatal error: sys/mman.h: No such file or directory


Also, I get the following errors from shm.c:

I guess these are due to missing or platform-dependent include files.


Any assistance appreciated.
