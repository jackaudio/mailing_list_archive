Hi Jason,

Whats your goal?
Playing back music over bluetooth? Stick with pulseaudio.

JACK is a professional tool to route audio between applications with low
latency.
Its probably not the tool you're looking for w.r.t sending audio over
bluetooth.

That said, it would be technically possible (easily enough if you have some
coding experience) to write a JACK client to send the audio it recieves
over a bluetooth connection. As far as I'm aware its not yet available,
probably due to lack of people needing this functionality, as it doesn't
fit into a professional workflow much.

Hope that helped! Cheers, -Harry

&gt; Hello All,
&gt;
&gt; I just got a jawbone jambox bluetooth device and was trying to find a
&gt; jack application to connect to this bluetooth device and play audio
&gt; from jack.  I seem to be at a dead end with that search for a
&gt; solution.  I see that pulseaudio is bluetooth enabled out of the box
&gt; but on my system, jack and pulseaudio never played well together.
&gt; Meaning that pulseaudio always crashed.  Anyone have a solution?
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
