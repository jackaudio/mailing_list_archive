Hi Jason,

Whats your goal?
Playing back music over bluetooth? Stick with pulseaudio.

JACK is a professional tool to route audio between applications with low
latency.
Its probably not the tool you're looking for w.r.t sending audio over
bluetooth.

That said, it would be technically possible (easily enough if you have some
coding experience) to write a JACK client to send the audio it recieves
over a bluetooth connection. As far as I'm aware its not yet available,
probably due to lack of people needing this functionality, as it doesn't
fit into a professional workflow much.

Hope that helped! Cheers, -Harry
