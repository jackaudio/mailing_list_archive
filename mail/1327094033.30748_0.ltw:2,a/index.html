Hello Harry,

My goal is to use the speaker and microphone on the bluetooth device
and design new interactions requiring low latency.  The bluetooth
device is just an I/O device that I want to use.  I am really wanting
to test the latencies of the adc/dac and the bluetooth transport as
well.  I am familiar with creating jack_clients but not sure where to
start as far as the whole bluetooth interaction and linux.  Just
seeing if anyone has attempted a jack client implementation with
bluetooth.

thanks,
jason

&gt; Hi Jason,
&gt;
&gt; Whats your goal?
&gt; Playing back music over bluetooth? Stick with pulseaudio.
&gt;
&gt; JACK is a professional tool to route audio between applications with low
&gt; latency.
&gt; Its probably not the tool you're looking for w.r.t sending audio over
&gt; bluetooth.
&gt;
&gt; That said, it would be technically possible (easily enough if you have some
&gt; coding experience) to write a JACK client to send the audio it recieves over
&gt; a bluetooth connection. As far as I'm aware its not yet available, probably
&gt; due to lack of people needing this functionality, as it doesn't fit into a
&gt; professional workflow much.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helped! Cheers, -Harry

&gt;&gt; Hello All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I just got a jawbone jambox bluetooth device and was trying to find a
&gt;&gt; jack application to connect to this bluetooth device and play audio
&gt;&gt; from jack. &#xA0;I seem to be at a dead end with that search for a
&gt;&gt; solution. &#xA0;I see that pulseaudio is bluetooth enabled out of the box
&gt;&gt; but on my system, jack and pulseaudio never played well together.
&gt;&gt; Meaning that pulseaudio always crashed. &#xA0;Anyone have a solution?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thanks,
&gt;&gt; jason
