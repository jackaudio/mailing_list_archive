Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jack and bluetooth?

Hello Harry,

My goal is to use the speaker and microphone on the bluetooth device
and design new interactions requiring low latency.  The bluetooth
device is just an I/O device that I want to use.  I am really wanting
to test the latencies of the adc/dac and the bluetooth transport as
well.  I am familiar with creating jack_clients but not sure where to
start as far as the whole bluetooth interaction and linux.  Just
seeing if anyone has attempted a jack client implementation with
bluetooth.

thanks,
jason
