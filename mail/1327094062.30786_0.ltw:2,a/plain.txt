Isn't that more of an ALSA question?  If the bluetooth device can show up
as an ALSA device, then it should just work.

How does pulse connect to a bluetooth device?  Through ALSA, or does it
have some kind of alternate backend driver?

This page seems to indicate there is an effort underway to connect
bluetooth devices into ALSA infrastructure:
http://bluetooth-alsa.sourceforge.net/

Do you have bluez software loaded, and the service running?
http://www.bluez.org/about/

The first link seems to be the most informative.  At a quick glance, it
looks like you will have to connect your bluetooth device, figure out what
ALSA calls that device, then tell jack to use that ALSA device.
