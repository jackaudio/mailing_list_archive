I don't understand your use of terms here.  I think of "client" as a
software application which connects to a jack server.  It sounds to me
like you want to use jack to route between two different audio devices. 
Why so averse to connecting through ALSA?  The only alternative I see is
that you somehow convince the ALSA driver not to connect to your bluetooth
device, then write a custom JACK backend which just duplicates the
functionality of the ALSA driver.  Looks like double the work and half the
benefit to me.
