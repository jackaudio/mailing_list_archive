You could use (on jack2) alsa_in and alsa_out - I think those are the 
names, those clients let you connect to a second sound card and do the 
sample rate conversion for you (if jack is working with two separate 
sound cards something will have to sample rate convert one of them to 
exactly match the other's sampling rate).
