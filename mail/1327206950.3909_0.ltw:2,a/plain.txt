Along these lines, this page might be useful...

The only downside is the constant idle cpu usage sits around 3%
(core i7) which kills battery life on a laptop. Other than that it's
quite a useful Pulse-free technique for desktop audio usage. A bit
of work on the alsa sink to Jack idling problem and packaging it up,
perhaps with a couple of extra fields in qjackctl, would be very
interesting.
