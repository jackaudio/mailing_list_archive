Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: Windows jackrouter doesn't work for 32Bit applications

Hi Frank,

I'm using 1.9.8 - 64 with win7 64 bit and it works with all apps I got (many...) 64bit and 32bit
This version does exactly this ... works for both apps....


Stephane knows much better than me on this, but AFIK no need to register the 32bit dll !
Just the 64 and this once (when an update is to be made ect).

Which DAW x86 do you got ? Did you set -d ASIO ect in Jackportaudio properties/Target ?

Sorry to ask if you did just trying to figure out what's happening and if possible to help as we run similar OS.
Try to uninstall, clean registry and re- install, registering only the 64bit, then set driver (ASIO) and rate and buffer size in properties/target. Set the same buffer size in Asio, close both and re-open.


Better to send a kinda log for Stephane to be able to see and advice.

Best
Panos

Tried the last version for Windows Jack_v1.9.8_64 on Windows 7 64Bit with 32 and 64Bit DAWs.
There seems to be a problem with 32Bit applications (the jackrouter is not seen). With 64Bit applications it's working.

IMO the 32Bit server (COM) should be available in the registry inside the wow6432 (ASIO subfolder there)? But there is not such entry.
Using manually the regsvr32 to register the 32Bit dll is not working (no success feedback from the regsvr tool).

Is there something missing or is it a bug?
