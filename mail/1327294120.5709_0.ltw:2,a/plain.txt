Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack - audio group - package install

There's been a discussion between some people involved around Ubuntu 
Studio about audio group.

As a result of those discussions, a bug was filed. (audio group is used 
for two different things..)
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=656910

I'm however more concerned with the practical problem that the 
administration of realtime privileges present.
It's a common problem for thousands of new users, who have no idea about 
realtime privlege, memlock or audio group.
Audio based distros are able to fix this for them, but let's look at it 
this way:

Installing the jackd deb package will not give you realtime privilege. 
It will install the file /etc/security/init.d/audio.conf

"
..
@audio   -  rtprio     95
@audio   -  memlock    unlimited
..
"

To make use of it, you still need to belong to audio group.

Would it be possible to let the installation of jackd also add current 
user to audio group? Or, even all "normal" users.
I don't think Arch users would like this as much as let's say, Ubuntu or 
Mint users.
It would make things a lot simpler for a lot of people who only would 
need to install jackd to be able to use it in realtime (after a reboot).

And, what would be an alternative way to let users seemlessly get access 
to realtime privilege without having to belong to a special group at all?
