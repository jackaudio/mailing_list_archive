"Audio" is a pretty imprecise term for a group of users who have 
permission to schedule tasks for realtime operation. We should try to 
keep things consistent with the rest of the *nix world; "wheel," for 
example, makes complete sense, and its function is obvious based on its 
name.

Question: Does Jack check to see if a user is in a group before 
attempting to start in RT mode, or does it just try?

My suggestion would be to come up with a new group name--preempt, for 
example--which grants necessary permissions, and leave "audio" for the 
use Consolekit and udev specify.
