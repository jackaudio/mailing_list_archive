In-Reply-To: Frank Arnold [Jack-Devel] Windows jackrouter doesn't work for 32Bit applications (1327275991.21415_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows jackrouter doesn't work for 32Bit applications

It could be a dependency issue. Could you possible use Dependency Walker (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) and check the dependencies of JackRouterl.dll on your machine?

(32 bit JackRouterl.dll is in Program Files/Jack/32bits folder)

Thanks.
