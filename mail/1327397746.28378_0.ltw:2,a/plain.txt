Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Bypass alsa_in/out resampling ?

Hello,

I was wondering if there already was an option in alsa_in/out that would allow me to bypass resampling. Say I have 2 physical sound devices that are linked physically in a clock master / slave configuration. Presumably, the resampling done by alsa_in/out on the other device (the one that jackd is not running on) would seem useless, or would it ?

Another loosely related question: does someone know where the clocking of the virtual loopback device (snd-aloop) take its source from ? System clock ? Can the snd-aloop be made a clock slave of a real sound hardware in some way ? I am asking because of the following:

- if snd-aloop can be clock slave of my RME HDSP
- if alsa_in/out can avoid resampling audio from snd-aloop, the ALSA-to-Jack bridge based on the virtual loopback device would have a small footprint on the processing environment, not to say none. 


These questions were inspired from a previous comment about laptops discharging fast when this bridge is in use due to alsa_in/out's footprint.

Thanks for any input.

J.
