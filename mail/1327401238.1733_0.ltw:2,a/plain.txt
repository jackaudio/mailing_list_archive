Hello.
About your first problem, this page :
http://jackaudio.org/multiple_devices explains what may be the right
solution for you : merging your two soundcards into one virtual alsa
device (section 3. of the page). It think it doesn't do resampling.

Ah, you actually bring me back to an idea I had but which I had not investigated. I knew about the ALSA multi plugin but I wanted to avoid it if I could because I read somewhere that jackd had better be running on real hw, not "plug" devices. But why not ? I could try that. However, it does not solve my clocking issue with snd-aloop (which is a virtual device, remember).

Thanks for the heads-up,

J.
