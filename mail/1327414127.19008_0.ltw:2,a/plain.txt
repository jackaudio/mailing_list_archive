this is indeed the best solution in this case. it is a bad idea to do
this without clock sync, but an excellent idea to do it with clock
sync.

a virtual ALSA device can *never* be a clock source for a physical
audio interface. you need to be able to attach a cable to deliver the
clock signal to the hardware.

No, I was asking about the other way around: is there any way the virtual ALSA device could be sync'ed to the real hw ?
