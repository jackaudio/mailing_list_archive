I have not seen any other methods than what both of us have described 
and I fully understand that the name for audio group can be anything and 
so forth.

Why I brought up this subject is to try find a good solution to a 
practical problem. Namely, how to get realtime privilege simply by 
installing jackd.

Solutions:

1. There is a group dedicated to that from the start (on 
Debian/Ubuntu/Mint), which is a default group for all desktop users.

2. The installation of jack administers group membership for users.

The more I thought about it, the more I started to think why not try to 
achieve 1.? 2. doesn't feel like a good solution.

What bugs me is that you can install jack, but you won't get realtime 
privilege doing so. It's an unnecessary step to administer groups. It's 
just a strange thing to do.

And, when it comes to realtime kernels and pro audio and such. It 
doesn't have to be the best of the best, as long as it works within 
acceptable boundaries. Every computer doesn't need to be a production 
machine designed only for pro audio.

I don't have any data to show, but to me a preempt (-lowlatency) kernel 
is all I need these days, while a vanilla kernel is not reliable enough. 
That is another issue of course. In my view, it would be great to see 
-lowlatency kernels in both Debian and Ubuntu repos.

I have no trouble with setting up realtime privilege. I would just like 
that no one else would either, ever.
