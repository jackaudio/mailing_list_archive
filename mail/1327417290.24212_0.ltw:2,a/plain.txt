For a start, it would help if you could acknowledge the fact that
jack-devel has nothing to do with how to enable users of a given
distribution to achieve something.

We have your bug report, we're working on it, and in maybe four weeks,
the solution will be in Debian. In some more weeks, it'll also be in
Ubuntu.

Meanwhile, you have to live with the burden of an additional

    "adduser foo audio"

It's been like this for years, it was acceptable so far. Let's take it a
little further and do what's necessary to play nicely with ConsoleKit.

Note that plenty of jackd users neither use nor want ConsoleKit, so your
use case is probably less common than you think. Just because you were
facing the issue doesn't mean it's always like this.

Current idea: we'll fire up a dialogue, asking something like "Which
user should have realtime prios?". You name it, that's it.


Comments?
