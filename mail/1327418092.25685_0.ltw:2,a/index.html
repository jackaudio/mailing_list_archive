&gt;&gt; Why I brought up this subject is to try find a good solution to a
&gt;&gt; practical problem. Namely, how to get realtime privilege simply by
&gt;&gt; installing jackd.
&gt;
&gt; For a start, it would help if you could acknowledge the fact that
&gt; jack-devel has nothing to do with how to enable users of a given
&gt; distribution to achieve something.
&gt;

  I understand that this is true, but there is no way for me to know 
whether there could be another way to solve it other than per distribution.

&gt; We have your bug report, we're working on it, and in maybe four weeks,
&gt; the solution will be in Debian. In some more weeks, it'll also be in
&gt; Ubuntu.
&gt;

I'm hoping that this will be to the benefit for a large sum of users.

&gt; Meanwhile, you have to live with the burden of an additional
&gt;
&gt; "adduser foo audio"
&gt;
&gt; It's been like this for years, it was acceptable so far. Let's take it a
&gt; little further and do what's necessary to play nicely with ConsoleKit.
&gt;
&gt; Note that plenty of jackd users neither use nor want ConsoleKit, so your
&gt; use case is probably less common than you think. Just because you were
&gt; facing the issue doesn't mean it's always like this.
&gt;

Those who have never had to administer groups will not know they need to 
upon installing jack. I'm often helping people solve this on irc, so it 
is a definitely a continuous problem. One which can easily be solved by 
reading jack faq, but on the other hand, wouldn't it be great if they 
didn't need to?

&gt;
&gt;&gt; What bugs me is that you can install jack, but you won't get realtime
&gt;&gt; privilege doing so. It's an unnecessary step to administer groups. It's
&gt;&gt; just a strange thing to do.
&gt;
&gt; Current idea: we'll fire up a dialogue, asking something like "Which
&gt; user should have realtime prios?". You name it, that's it.
&gt;

I'd say anyone who wants to play a live instrument more or less.

&gt;
&gt; Comments?
