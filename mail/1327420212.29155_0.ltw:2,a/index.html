IMHO the whole realtime-group stuff is based on the 'wrong solution' to 
the problem, i.e.

Problem: Certain processes have special realtime requirements, which 
have to be granted by the kernel. The kernel only trusts 'root'  [not 
exactly, but good enough for now].

Current solution: Use the mechanisms already in place, user/group based 
access control. A trusted (root) process then creates a appropriately 
limited environment for for that user (on login).

Actually needed solution: There are certain processes (jackd) that 
I/administrator/distros would like to give certain extended rights. 
There are others (e.g. some buggy audio-software that happens to request 
realtime priority) that should not have them. Even more, certain rights 
(e.g. access to audio devices) might depend on changing factors (e.g. 
fast-user-switching).
The usual way to deal with this on unix is to have a (e.g. audio) daemon 
run as root. Due to the way jack works, this is not an option.
ConsoleKit has recognized that: We can't do all the work as a root, but 
at least do the minimum thing, permission granting, in a 'clean' way.

So what I'm proposing is to rethink the way jackd acquires realtime 
abilities.
Why not use some sort of realtime-granting daemon? Sure, adding another 
layer of indirection seems overkill, but we're currently facing the same 
issues again and again.

Another thing: Security ("I can trick the granting-damon into thinking I 
am jackd, so I can become realtime") should not be our primary concern 
here; nevertheless I think practical solutions to that can be found.
