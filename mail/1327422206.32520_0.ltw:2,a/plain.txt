true. i had forgotten our old nemesis, CGROUPs. as long as they are
correctly configured, then cgroups could be used. but they are even
harder to configure than PAM limits, so the likelihood that a distro
will get this right seems small. and like PAM limits, its not
something JACK could/would configure itself, i think.

i could be wrong.
