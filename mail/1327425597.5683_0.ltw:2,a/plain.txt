Ok, thanks for the hint. I had been looking at the problem from a higher 
perspective. The two things I had in mind were:
1. Either the kernel provides some kind of CAP_* for jackd to call the 
relevant kernel API itself, or
2. another (root) process can be used, doing something like 
"set_rt_prio([PID_OF_JACK])" on jacks request.

CGroups are quite another beast, I agree. Still, they might be part of a 
long-term solution.
