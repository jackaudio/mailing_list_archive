I didn't intend to "changing anything", I was only talking about
creating the repo itself, still being based on the current svn setup.

The switch will come later.

[Lenthy discussion about hosting removed]

I'd create it on github for now. It can later be cloned to
jackaudio.org. It doesn't matter where it resideres, people can
push/pull between jackaudio.org and github at any time.


And I guess it's still too early to switch tracs. It's only to have
something to work with. A dry-run. ;)
