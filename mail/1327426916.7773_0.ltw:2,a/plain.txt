jackaudio.org itself could be hosted at jackaudio.github.com as long as
regular server side scripts are not needed, this way, even the main site
is under Git and forkable for pull requests.

Just start from scratch at github, zero effort. The issue tracker
supports tags so Features and Bugs, even Discussion, can be separated.

It's not an overly sophisticated issue tracker but that could be
considered a good thing for non-techie users. The best part is that
all the issues can be received and REPLIED to via email. That feature
alone is worth the price of admission.

Turn the current jackaudio.org into mirror.jackaudio.org and use
commit hooks to update everything to it. With a 5 min DNS TTL it
could become jackaudio.org fairly quickly, for any reason... or at
least just a cgit frontend to a normal mirrored Git based repo.

A switch to Github could be all finished in a day. Job done.

If, for any reason it proves unsatisfactory then a move to anywhere
else is almost painless because everything would be in Git. There is
almost no negative downside to moving to Github with the possibility
of a lot to gain... if the move itself only achieves condensing the
whole project to a set of Git repos that ultimately could end up
being hosted elsewhere. In the mean time the Gitub "social coding"
aspect is very real.
