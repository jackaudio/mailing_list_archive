Yes.

I think a near optimal solution (there are bound to be cases where this 
might be undesirable) would be to have SCHED_FIFO/RR permissions tied to 
the active login session[*]. I tried once to see how this might be done 
but failed (I was trying to use one of the many *kit thingies, I forget 
which).

Ideally you install an extra package that has a suitable configuration 
file and only users that login physically to the computer would be 
granted rt access and only during the duration of the login (if users 
are switched, permissions follow the currently active user, etc, etc).

In Planet CCRMA I have an additional small package that you install and 
gives everyone access to rt but that is considered by many an additional 
security risk (low IMO, but not zero).

[*] if you don't have active login sessions you probably know enough 
linux to configure things manually so that it works - for standalone 
systems, for example
