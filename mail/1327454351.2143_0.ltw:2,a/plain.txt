I disagree. It would be ideal.

I don't think there is anything wrong with RT privileges.

I try to give users (and that includes myself) the least amount of 
privileges that still allows them to do the work they need to do. 
Nothing less. Nothing more.

We could as well say there is no need for filesystem permissions or user 
accounts. We would just all login as root and share the system 
responsibly. And yes, it would work if all users sharing such a system 
were responsible and knowledgeable. I would not do that. It would only 
be a matter of time till I nuked the system :-)

If there is a way to give RT privileges to only the user sitting in 
front of the console and using the system I will use that. In my 
scenario it is the only user in that machine that needs that privilege. 
There is nothing wrong with the process being automatic and requiring no 
configuration.

 From the point of view of the user it makes no difference to do that, 
or give access to all users all the time. In both cases the work gets 
done. But universal access is not necessary to get the work done.

And I would not (and do not) set up this way, say, the Listening Room 
workstation that runs OpenMixer (and Jack) all the time with no users 
around.
