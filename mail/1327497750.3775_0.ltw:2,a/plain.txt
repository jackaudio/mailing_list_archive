no. what we need to avoid is that users remain unaware of the problem 
unless they do a web search. the package installation process should pop 
up a note about the groups and realtime issue, and just tell them to 
read the faq.

users who don't read faqs when they encounter a problem even though they 
know about the existence of a faq should be punished.

guidance for users is important and productive, but nobody needs users 
who claim a right to ignorance, they don't help to improve the software, 
all they do is waste other people's time.

institutionalizing a user's alleged right to ignorance by adding 
behind-the-curtains magic (which hurts other users who do not wish to be 
ignorant) is an abomination punishable with 10 years of network 
administration duty in a windows vista shop.
