Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jackd1/jackd2: FFADO port name divergence

Hi!

I've just noticed that jackd1's FFADO backend uses system:playback_%i
for the portnames and the FFADO provided name vector as an alias while
jackd2 does it vice versa, that is, the handy name is the primary name
and system:playback_%i is the alias.


system:capture_5
   firewire_pcm:C4_0005950400400fb2_SPDIF L


The most obvious consequence so far is that tools like qjackctl/patchage
or applications like ardour will leave the user without a clue what
capture_5 is if running on jackd1, not so on jackd2.


Fixing it is quite easy (once you guys agree who's right ;)), OTOH, this
is just another occurrence of the jackd port name problem we had a
couple of weeks ago.

That said, I still have this prototype that renames arbitrary ports at
runtime. Maybe it's time to revive it. It would also enable ALSA users
to rename their channels. Maximum freedom without any jackd imposed
conventions.


Cheers
