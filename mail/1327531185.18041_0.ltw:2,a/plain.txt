Subject:     [Jack-Devel] netjack for thinclients instead of pulseaudio.

Hi,

I'm wondering whether netjack could solve a problem I have with some 
resource constrained thin clients in a ltsp setup.

The problem I have:

The default ltsp setup uses pulseaudio for pushing the audio for each 
user to the respective thin client.  However the pulseaudio daemon dies 
on the thinclients due to resource constraints.  Pulseaudio does all the 
resampling on the daemon on the thinclient which is probably what is 
killing it.

The Questions:

Could jack2/netjack be a potential solution to this problem?

*To do so it would need to be able the following:
a) run a separate jack daemon for each user in their session on the 
server and connect via netjack to the jackd running on the thinclient.
b) do all the resampling in the jack daemon running in the session on 
the server
c) use minimal resources on the thinclient to interface the netjack
sink/sources with the real hardware

*latency shouldn't be a big issue with 100ms being more then acceptable
*audio quality can be quite low (headsets on the thinclients) and xruns 
due to network latency are preferred over daemons stopping

I am assuming that the netjack master should be at the thin-client end.

Your thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks,
