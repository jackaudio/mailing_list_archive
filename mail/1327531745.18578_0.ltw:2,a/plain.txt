I'm not suggesting anything like that. When I refer to awareness
and responsability it is not those of a group of users using some
shared resources (although it matters in that case well, and can
make life a better experience).
You view things from the POV of sysadmin at an institution which
is of course perfectly OK. I take the same position when I'm in
that role here - be it at a much smaller scale. But if someowe
writes "wouldn't it be great not to have to add yourself to the
audio group" then that is from a completely different POV, that
of the average individual user who is the owner, master and only
admin of the system he's using. If such a user can't be bothered
to take up his own responsability, to acquire a minimum amount of
knowledge, and relies only the distro gods above to protect him,
then IMHO he deserves to be nuked. And those who for their own
profit or glory stimulate such a sheepish attitude deserve even
worse.

It's not because something is convenient to you, me, or even to a 
majority of users that it should be the default.
