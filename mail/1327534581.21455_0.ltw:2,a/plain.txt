useful/pretty/semantic names need to be accessible to any JACK client
that wants to find stuff or display stuff. thus they need to have
well-defined URIs that are not the domain of a single application.

when a user makes a port into "monitors/L", they presumably want all
apps to be able to show that as "monitors/L" even if the canonical
name continues to exist.
