The really simple way to achieve that is to name the port 'monitors/L'
and forget about all other names, aliases or whatever.

And yes that would make e.g. an Ardour session fail when it expects
'monitor/[LR]' and those ports don't exist. It fails becaus it should
fail, it does so in a safe way, and it's easy to fix.
