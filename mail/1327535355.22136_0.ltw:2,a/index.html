Hi Daniel,

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering whether netjack could solve a problem I have with some
&gt; resource constrained thin clients in a ltsp setup.

LTSP? as in Long-Term Surveillance Plan (which superseded Linux Terminal
Server Projects :))

&gt; The problem I have:
&gt; 
&gt; The default ltsp setup uses pulseaudio for pushing the audio for each
&gt; user to the respective thin client.  However the pulseaudio daemon dies
&gt; on the thinclients due to resource constraints.  Pulseaudio does all the
&gt; resampling on the daemon on the thinclient which is probably what is
&gt; killing it.

That's not the problem _you_ have. That's a problem _pulseaudio_ has :)

What services do you want to provide to users of the terminal-server? Is
it for audio-production or a general-purpose system?


jackd (here jack2) uses ~50-100MB RSS memory, which is also not lightweight.

&gt; The Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Could jack2/netjack be a potential solution to this problem?

maybe, but not out-of-the box.

&gt; *To do so it would need to be able the following:
&gt; a) run a separate jack daemon for each user in their session on the
&gt; server and connect via netjack to the jackd running on the thinclient.

AFAIK netjack does not [yet?] include authentication. A client can
connect to any session on a server.

You can [auto-]start multiple netjack 'slaves' on the server using
different UDP ports and possibly different multi-cast addresses for each
session on the terminal server.

You could implement authentication with per-user firewall rules?!

&gt; b) do all the resampling in the jack daemon running in the session on
&gt; the server

check. but note: JACK does not do any resampling. Ever. The player
application (mplayer, Flash,...) running on the server needs to do
resampling before sending data to JACK in the first place.

&gt; c) use minimal resources on the thinclient to interface the netjack
&gt; sink/sources with the real hardware

check. Here: it's basically only compression/encoding (speex) that
requires CPU on the thin-client.

&gt; *latency shouldn't be a big issue with 100ms being more then acceptable

actually you will have a hard time to convince jack to run with
latencies &gt; 100ms :) -- well, only half joking.

&gt; *audio quality can be quite low (headsets on the thinclients) and xruns
&gt; due to network latency are preferred over daemons stopping
&gt; 
&gt; I am assuming that the netjack master should be at the thin-client end.

yes. The master needs to provide the clock. And JACK uses the
audio-interface's clock/oscillator as source for that (which in your
case is on the thin-client).


http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack2

&gt; Your thoughts would be appreciated.

Unless the main-use case for the terminal server is audio-production; I
don't think this will fly.

If you provide terminal-services to some radio, music or media company.
Yes, JACK is the way to go.
If you build a terminal-server for e.g. a university computer pool or
general public use: get in touch with the pulseaudio devs and see if
there's something that can be done about the crashes (you should
probably do that anyway, at least make them aware of the problem).
Connecting Desktop-Audio (in-browser playback, flash-applets, live-chat)
to JACK is not trivial; more so for in multi-user setups.

2c,
robin
