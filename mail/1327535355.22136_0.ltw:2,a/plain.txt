LTSP? as in Long-Term Surveillance Plan (which superseded Linux Terminal

That's not the problem _you_ have. That's a problem _pulseaudio_ has :)

What services do you want to provide to users of the terminal-server? Is
it for audio-production or a general-purpose system?


jackd (here jack2) uses ~50-100MB RSS memory, which is also not lightweight.

maybe, but not out-of-the box.

AFAIK netjack does not [yet?] include authentication. A client can
connect to any session on a server.

You can [auto-]start multiple netjack 'slaves' on the server using
different UDP ports and possibly different multi-cast addresses for each
session on the terminal server.

You could implement authentication with per-user firewall rules?!

check. but note: JACK does not do any resampling. Ever. The player
application (mplayer, Flash,...) running on the server needs to do
resampling before sending data to JACK in the first place.

check. Here: it's basically only compression/encoding (speex) that
requires CPU on the thin-client.

actually you will have a hard time to convince jack to run with
latencies > 100ms :) -- well, only half joking.

yes. The master needs to provide the clock. And JACK uses the
audio-interface's clock/oscillator as source for that (which in your
case is on the thin-client).

Unless the main-use case for the terminal server is audio-production; I
don't think this will fly.

If you provide terminal-services to some radio, music or media company.
Yes, JACK is the way to go.
If you build a terminal-server for e.g. a university computer pool or
general public use: get in touch with the pulseaudio devs and see if
there's something that can be done about the crashes (you should
probably do that anyway, at least make them aware of the problem).
Connecting Desktop-Audio (in-browser playback, flash-applets, live-chat)
to JACK is not trivial; more so for in multi-user setups.

2c,
robin
