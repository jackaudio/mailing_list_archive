not arbitrary. it connected to the ports with the same canonical name
as last time.

which is what an overwhelming majority of JACK users need and want.

how to provide the functionality (or lack thereof) that some JACK
users want is why the notion of tagging/renaming/metadata-labelling
ports has arisen. and yes, simply renaming the ports is the simplest
way to do this. but it also lacks many other nice properties that a
similar number of JACK users would appreciate.
