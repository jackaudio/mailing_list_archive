Oh yes. And maybe you want to pay the bill. Because it was Ardour2's
Auditioner, activated accidentally by a novice user while importing,
and autoconnected and set at maximum volume even if the session was

I don't give a damn about what 'the overwhelming majority of JACK users'
need and want. I expect an application not to do such things.
