Well, that's too late. This could have been fixed years ago. It
would probably have taken five minutes for someone familiar with
the code (which I am not). It could have saved me 650 Euros which
I could have donated to Ardour development instead of having to
spend them on repairs. Something I'm not inclined to do ATM for
rather obvious reasons.

Expecting an app not to send high level signals on an output that
was *explicitly* disabled and disconnected as nothing to do with
my very personal preferences.
