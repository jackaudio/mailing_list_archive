Two people have said this, and while it's technically true, it can be 
gotten around. For each of your thin-clients, you would start a JACK 
daemon with the net backend, and then jack_load the client that connects 
to ALSA and does the resampling... I've done this for recording sessions 
where, in an emergency, I had to connect 2 rooms and all I had between 
them was network. I don't remember the details.

I wish people would start putting an asterisk (*) after saying 
"[net]jack does not resample," because there is a plugin, bundled with 
jack, that handles resampling for connections to multiple soundcards 
over a network.

What you're proposing would be really ugly to implement, and would 
consume a lot of server and client resources. You'd probably be better 
off just using thick clients instead of thin clients. (That is, run all 
the applications on the client, rather than the server; just have root 
on NFS.)
