Subject:     [Jack-Devel] How do I start jackd without dbus interference

Hi.

For my thin client testing I'm having trouble getting jack to start as a 
root daemon.  It seems to fail in negotiation with dbus for access to 
the hardware.

Is there a flag that tells jack to not query dbus at all?


When running "jackd -vvvv -p32 -R -P89 -dalsa -dhw:0" I get the 
following output
