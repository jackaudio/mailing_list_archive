NetJack does work quite well for think/zero-clients,
though my setup has a bug that has problems on
start-up that cause 30-50% of starts to fail.  I
haven't had enough time to fix that.  If you'd like
my scripts, let me know an email address to send
them to.  If there's wider interest, I wouldn't
mind sharing.

&gt; Subject: [Jack-Devel] netjack for thinclients instead of pulseaudio.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering whether netjack could solve a problem I have with some 
&gt; resource constrained thin clients in a ltsp setup.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem I have:
&gt; 
&gt; The default ltsp setup uses pulseaudio for pushing the audio for each 
&gt; user to the respective thin client.  However the pulseaudio daemon dies 
&gt; on the thinclients due to resource constraints.  Pulseaudio does all the 
&gt; resampling on the daemon on the thinclient which is probably what is 
&gt; killing it.
&gt; 
&gt; The Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Could jack2/netjack be a potential solution to this problem?
&gt; 
&gt; *To do so it would need to be able the following:
&gt; a) run a separate jack daemon for each user in their session on the 
&gt; server and connect via netjack to the jackd running on the thinclient.
&gt; b) do all the resampling in the jack daemon running in the session on 
&gt; the server
&gt; c) use minimal resources on the thinclient to interface the netjack
&gt; sink/sources with the real hardware
&gt; 
&gt; *latency shouldn't be a big issue with 100ms being more then acceptable
&gt; *audio quality can be quite low (headsets on the thinclients) and xruns 
&gt; due to network latency are preferred over daemons stopping
&gt; 
&gt; I am assuming that the netjack master should be at the thin-client end.
&gt; 
&gt; Your thoughts would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
