NetJack does work quite well for think/zero-clients,
though my setup has a bug that has problems on
start-up that cause 30-50% of starts to fail.  I
haven't had enough time to fix that.  If you'd like
my scripts, let me know an email address to send
them to.  If there's wider interest, I wouldn't
mind sharing.
