Correct, I had to do that in one occasion. Needless to say I don't like 
having to do that :-)

Having said that, I think the card negotiation logic in jack2 has 
changed. It used to be that if the negotiation with dbus failed 
(regardless of the reason), it still tried to open the soundcard and if 
the card was free jackd started just fine. In the last version (or 
versions, I don't know when this changed) it will not even try. This may 
be the "correct" behavior, but it should be possible to disable that 
with a command line switch.
