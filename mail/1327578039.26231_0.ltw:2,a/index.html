&gt;&gt; Why I brought up this subject is to try find a good solution to a
&gt;&gt; practical problem. Namely, how to get realtime privilege simply by
&gt;&gt; installing jackd.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Solutions:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. There is a group dedicated to that from the start (on
&gt;&gt; Debian/Ubuntu/Mint), which is a default group for all desktop users.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2. The installation of jack administers group membership for users.
&gt;
&gt; that is something a windows wizard would do, and it's broken because it
&gt; has implications that the user is unaware of. there are a few simple
&gt; golden rules that distinguish a sane and intelligent operating system
&gt; from a toy:
&gt;
&gt; * never second-guess the user. there are way too many "user-friendly"
&gt; automatisms on linux systems already.
&gt;
&gt; * installing a package should *never* *ever* re-configure existing users
&gt; by default. it can check for the existence of a group and add it if it's
&gt; not there, but a package that screws with my user database is just
&gt; broken. the assumption might work for you, but it's just wrong in
&gt; principle, which is easy to see for anyone who has ever administrated a
&gt; moderately complex multi-user system.
&gt;
&gt; * a user who wants to achieve something as advanced as real-time audio
&gt; has no right to remain ignorant about basic system privileges. on the
&gt; contrary, intelligent users appreciate being educated about important
&gt; aspects of their system.
&gt;
&gt; the correct solution to this problem is to add a post-install script
&gt; that pops up a little information screen for the user telling her that
&gt; there's this group called "audio" or "realtime" or whatever, that
&gt; everybody who wants to use jack must be in, and would she like to start
&gt; the distro's user and group administration tool now? then afterwards
&gt; tell the user to log out and back in, and everybody is happy. no extra
&gt; $FOOkit, no quirky realtime demon, all is well.
&gt;
&gt;

I agree on that administrating users database is wrong, so I've changed 
my mind about that.
I don't agree that users need to know how group administration works.

I agree that the right way to do it is exactly how you propose.
But, even better would be a solution that would require no group at all. 
I'm not the one to make that happen, so I close my case on this subject.
