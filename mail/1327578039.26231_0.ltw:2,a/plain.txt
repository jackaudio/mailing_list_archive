I agree on that administrating users database is wrong, so I've changed 
my mind about that.
I don't agree that users need to know how group administration works.

I agree that the right way to do it is exactly how you propose.
But, even better would be a solution that would require no group at all. 
I'm not the one to make that happen, so I close my case on this subject.
