Hi again, 

i was wondering if there was any way to setup 
a jack server that listens to 
multiple sound devices? seeing as ASIO 4 ALL 
has the ability to see all devices i 
would presume it is similar within jack.

I am asking because i need to run jack to my 
main Creative ASIO drivers for output 
to headphones and normal output, i am 
running traktor into ableton but i need a 
microphone input. i was hoping to run 
it into ableton on a channel that triggers a 
sidechain compressor for the main output 
as i'm doing a radio show next week from 
home. i have a peavey PV20 desk that has 
usb but it's the shittest usb config 
going in comes from main out and out 
goes to main out so it creates it's own 
internal loop when selected as both also 
anything that goes into the desk is on 
the same stereo to the computer and so 
multiple channels won't happen, but i can 
isolate it for a single mic input and go 
through another desk to my amp. 

So i would like to run jack 1.9.8 with 
Creative ASIO and USB Audio Device 
together, USB out would not be used but 
IN and the outs for the Creative drivers.

the reason for not using the Audigy's input
is it's only 3.5mm Jack and i'm on XLR 
for the Mic... if absolutely necessary 
maybe but workaround if poss.

thanks for your swift reply last time.

peace

Robbie
