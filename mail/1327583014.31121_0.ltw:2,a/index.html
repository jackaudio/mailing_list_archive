JACK audio backend on WIndows is using PortAudio ( http://portaudio.com/). 

PortAudio has no notion of "devices aggregation" so I would say it cannot be done.

&gt; Hi again, 
&gt; 
&gt; i was wondering if there was any way to setup 
&gt; a jack server that listens to 
&gt; multiple sound devices? seeing as ASIO 4 ALL 
&gt; has the ability to see all devices i 
&gt; would presume it is similar within jack.
&gt; 
&gt; I am asking because i need to run jack to my 
&gt; main Creative ASIO drivers for output 
&gt; to headphones and normal output, i am 
&gt; running traktor into ableton but i need a 
&gt; microphone input. i was hoping to run 
&gt; it into ableton on a channel that triggers a 
&gt; sidechain compressor for the main output 
&gt; as i'm doing a radio show next week from 
&gt; home. i have a peavey PV20 desk that has 
&gt; usb but it's the shittest usb config 
&gt; going in comes from main out and out 
&gt; goes to main out so it creates it's own 
&gt; internal loop when selected as both also 
&gt; anything that goes into the desk is on 
&gt; the same stereo to the computer and so 
&gt; multiple channels won't happen, but i can 
&gt; isolate it for a single mic input and go 
&gt; through another desk to my amp. 
&gt; 
&gt; So i would like to run jack 1.9.8 with 
&gt; Creative ASIO and USB Audio Device 
&gt; together, USB out would not be used but 
&gt; IN and the outs for the Creative drivers.
&gt; 
&gt; the reason for not using the Audigy's input
&gt; is it's only 3.5mm Jack and i'm on XLR 
&gt; for the Mic... if absolutely necessary 
&gt; maybe but workaround if poss.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for your swift reply last time.
&gt; 
&gt; peace
&gt; 
&gt; Robbie
