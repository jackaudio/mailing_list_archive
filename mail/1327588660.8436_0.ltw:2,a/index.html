And your credit card PIN, the root password of your (non-virtual)

Yes.

&gt; it's accepted practice to ban people from driving unless they have shown  
&gt; in a very formalized way they are up to the task. i don't see why we  
&gt; should have people who refuse to get a clue about access control basics  
&gt; connect to our common network infrastructure and screw it up for 
&gt; everybody.

Same for sports that create some risk such as diving or speleology,
handling a motorised boat, hanging stage lights and speakers above
people, electrical wiring, using potentially dangerous substances,
etc. etc. And still some people manage to have their fingers blown
away by fireworks each new year.

When you move into a new home you may want to give a copy of
the key to your loved one, maybe some of your familiy, a trusted
friend or neighbour. Would you like the landlord to do that by
default, and without even informing you ? I guess the answer is
no - you need to be aware of these things and take your own
decisions. Basic access or privilege control on a PC is not
really different. And getting things for free is no excuse for
voluntary ignorance - even if it seems to stimulate it.

&gt; and what benefit is there for free software developers to cater to  
&gt; unemancipated users? what could they possibly give in return?

Only trouble.
