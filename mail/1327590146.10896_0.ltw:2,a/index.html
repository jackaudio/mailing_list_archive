&gt;&gt; open source software in my book is first of all a tool for the

&gt;
&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; it's accepted practice to ban people from driving unless they have shown
&gt;&gt; in a very formalized way they are up to the task. i don't see why we
&gt;&gt; should have people who refuse to get a clue about access control basics
&gt;&gt; connect to our common network infrastructure and screw it up for
&gt;&gt; everybody.
&gt;
&gt; Same for sports that create some risk such as diving or speleology,
&gt; handling a motorised boat, hanging stage lights and speakers above
&gt; people, electrical wiring, using potentially dangerous substances,
&gt; etc. etc. And still some people manage to have their fingers blown
&gt; away by fireworks each new year.
&gt;
&gt; When you move into a new home you may want to give a copy of
&gt; the key to your loved one, maybe some of your familiy, a trusted
&gt; friend or neighbour. Would you like the landlord to do that by
&gt; default, and without even informing you ? I guess the answer is
&gt; no - you need to be aware of these things and take your own
&gt; decisions. Basic access or privilege control on a PC is not
&gt; really different. And getting things for free is no excuse for
&gt; voluntary ignorance - even if it seems to stimulate it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; and what benefit is there for free software developers to cater to
&gt;&gt; unemancipated users? what could they possibly give in return?
&gt;
&gt; Only trouble.
&gt;
&gt; Ciao,
&gt;

Perhaps instead of just asking for a password when a user wants to 
change something in their system (besides perhaps installing a piece of 
software), the user should be presented with three random system admin 
questions. Failure to answer would produce a notice saying:

"You are not qualified to administer this computer"

Jokes aside, security is important of course, but so is being able to do 
things in a fun way.
