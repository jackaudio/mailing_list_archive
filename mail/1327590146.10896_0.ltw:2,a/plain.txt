Perhaps instead of just asking for a password when a user wants to 
change something in their system (besides perhaps installing a piece of 
software), the user should be presented with three random system admin 
questions. Failure to answer would produce a notice saying:

"You are not qualified to administer this computer"

Jokes aside, security is important of course, but so is being able to do 
things in a fun way.
