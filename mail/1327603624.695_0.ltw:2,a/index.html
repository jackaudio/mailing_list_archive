&gt;&gt; We could as well say there is no need for filesystem permissions or user
&gt;&gt; accounts. We would just all login as root and share the system

&gt;&gt; were responsible and knowledgeable. I would not do that. It would only
&gt;&gt; be a matter of time till I nuked the system :-)
&gt;
&gt; I'm not suggesting anything like that. When I refer to awareness
&gt; and responsability it is not those of a group of users using some
&gt; shared resources (although it matters in that case well, and can
&gt; make life a better experience).
&gt; You view things from the POV of sysadmin at an institution which
&gt; is of course perfectly OK. I take the same position when I'm in
&gt; that role here - be it at a much smaller scale. But if someowe
&gt; writes "wouldn't it be great not to have to add yourself to the
&gt; audio group" then that is from a completely different POV, that
&gt; of the average individual user who is the owner, master and only
&gt; admin of the system he's using. If such a user can't be bothered
&gt; to take up his own responsability, to acquire a minimum amount of
&gt; knowledge, and relies only the distro gods above to protect him,
&gt; then IMHO he deserves to be nuked. And those who for their own
&gt; profit or glory stimulate such a sheepish attitude deserve even
&gt; worse.

It depends on your reading of the original request, and how you 
interpret the _motives_ behind such a request. My read was different, it 
was just "wouldn't it be great not to have to add yourself to the audio 
group". Not "wouldn't it be great not to have to add yourself to the 
audio group, I don't want to learn anything at all". Maybe I 
misinterpreted it.

&gt;&gt; If there is a way to give RT privileges to only the user sitting in
&gt;&gt; front of the console and using the system I will use that. In my
&gt;&gt; scenario it is the only user in that machine that needs that privilege.
&gt;&gt; There is nothing wrong with the process being automatic and requiring no
&gt;&gt; configuration.
&gt;
&gt; It's not because something is convenient to you, me, or even to a
&gt; majority of users that it should be the default.

I agree. What would be the criteria to use to make that decision?
Hmmm, maybe we are just talking about a general purpose distro?

The default in an audio oriented distribution should be that you don't 
need to do anything other than install it to get a fully tuned audio 
experience.

One way to do this in current systems is to give rt scheduling access to 
everyone all the time. General purpose distros have a problem with that 
(please let's start another thread to discuss if this is a real problem 
or not). But they allow that through a special group. So that the user 
has to voluntarily chose to enable rt scheduling. But if there was a way 
(I don't have it!) to dispense with that for audio oriented 
distributions, I would use it and I see nothing wrong with that.

A long time ago no one included the necessary incantation to enable 
anyone or even a group to use rt scheduling in /etc/security/limits.conf 
(and /etc/security/limits.d/ did not exist). You had to edit the file by 
hand. Oh the good old times. And then those things started to be shipped 
with jack or jack related "packages".

Was that a step back as well? Where do we draw the line?
