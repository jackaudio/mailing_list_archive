It depends on your reading of the original request, and how you 
interpret the _motives_ behind such a request. My read was different, it 
was just "wouldn't it be great not to have to add yourself to the audio 
group". Not "wouldn't it be great not to have to add yourself to the 
audio group, I don't want to learn anything at all". Maybe I 
misinterpreted it.

I agree. What would be the criteria to use to make that decision?
Hmmm, maybe we are just talking about a general purpose distro?

The default in an audio oriented distribution should be that you don't 
need to do anything other than install it to get a fully tuned audio 
experience.

One way to do this in current systems is to give rt scheduling access to 
everyone all the time. General purpose distros have a problem with that 
(please let's start another thread to discuss if this is a real problem 
or not). But they allow that through a special group. So that the user 
has to voluntarily chose to enable rt scheduling. But if there was a way 
(I don't have it!) to dispense with that for audio oriented 
distributions, I would use it and I see nothing wrong with that.

A long time ago no one included the necessary incantation to enable 
anyone or even a group to use rt scheduling in /etc/security/limits.conf 
(and /etc/security/limits.d/ did not exist). You had to edit the file by 
hand. Oh the good old times. And then those things started to be shipped 
with jack or jack related "packages".

Was that a step back as well? Where do we draw the line?
