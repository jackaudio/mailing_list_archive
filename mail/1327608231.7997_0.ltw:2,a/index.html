&gt; "Audio distros" usually set the first user to the group audio by
&gt; default. If you install a distro usually only one user and perhaps a
&gt; separated root account are installed, so you anyway need to add any
&gt; additional user manually, hence it shouldn't be an issue to set
&gt; additional users to the needed group(s) manually too.
&gt; This seems to be the best solution to fit to most needs.

Maybe it does, but it is very far from being correct. A solution where 
either all accounts are able to access rt scheduling or the logged in 
account can is far better.

Making the first user automatically belong to the audio group will 
create problems right away for users that are not aware of that hack (it 
is a hack) when they create a second user and it does not behave in the 
same way. Bad.

&gt; If many things are done automatically it is more comfortable as long as
&gt; everything works as expected, but as soon as there will be a problem,
&gt; troubleshooting will become a PITA. It's a balancing act.

Yes, of course.

My comment was in the context of pointing out how another older "by hand 
configuration" option was eventually turned into something automatic 
(and thus requiring no special knowledge from a new user).

&gt; There should be and there are different distros that fit to different
&gt; expectations. The policy of the distros we're using defines where the
&gt; line is drawn.
