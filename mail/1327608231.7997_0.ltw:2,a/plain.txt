Maybe it does, but it is very far from being correct. A solution where 
either all accounts are able to access rt scheduling or the logged in 
account can is far better.

Making the first user automatically belong to the audio group will 
create problems right away for users that are not aware of that hack (it 
is a hack) when they create a second user and it does not behave in the 
same way. Bad.

Yes, of course.

My comment was in the context of pointing out how another older "by hand 
configuration" option was eventually turned into something automatic 
(and thus requiring no special knowledge from a new user).
