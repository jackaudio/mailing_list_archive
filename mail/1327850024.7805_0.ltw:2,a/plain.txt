Subject:     [Jack-Devel] contract audio software project

Dear All

we are a medical company and are interested to find a developer for the
following small audio project

DLL or windows application when run does the following :

1. removes 50 and 60Hz noise on one mic channel, which will be the
heart-beat

2. Beat match the music played on the other channel

3. route both channels in realtime to the headphone out


or alternatively if you can create the interface for our .Net software that
we can use available standard VST plugins to do the above


let us know in discussing the framework of this project - or if you can
recommend a suitable developer

best regards

Kiran Schmidt
