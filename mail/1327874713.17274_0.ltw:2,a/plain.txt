some distributions do that. there's been widespread disagreement on
the correct target dir for 64 bit libs for years.

unfortunately, the configure.ac file right now has this semi-hard-coded:

----------------------------------
# We need to establish suitable defaults for a 64-bit OS
libnn=lib
case "${host_os}" in
    linux*)
    case "${host_cpu}" in
	x86_64|mips64|ppc64|sparc64|s390x)
        libnn=lib64
	;;
    esac
---------------------------------

you can override with with --libdir at the ./configure step, but it
really needs someone to suggest the right rule to determine which dir
to use.
