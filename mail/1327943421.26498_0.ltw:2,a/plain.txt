Hi!

I'm experiencing quite the same since a litlle time with ladish/jackdbus.
I'm using a quit complex setup with a big Ardour session on the middle of it.
Lately, and quit randomly, Ardour just couldn't finish its startup blocking on
certains ports creation.
The same, when looking at the logs, it seems that there are a lot of Xruns
coming at that time, though jack doesn't report any problem, it just seems quite
unusable.
Then, I switch to non-mixer, for several reasons, one of them being this
problem, and here is what it gives:
I've to run 11 instances of Non-Mixer, each with a big amount of clients/ports
(btw, I've built jackd2 with the clients = 256 and ports_per_application = 2048).
- if I run these instances manually (from a command line), and wait for one to
be ready (ports creation and connection) before lauching the next one,
everything is fine, and the DSP load is not that high, and the machine works
correctly ;
- if I run these instances from within ladish, then they're all launched at the
same time, and then, several of them just won't show up, as they're blocking on
certains ports creation (not always the same).

I'm using jackd2 1.9.8 freshly built from Debian Sources (SID), and I
experienced the very same with jackd2 1.9.7.

Hope that helps.
