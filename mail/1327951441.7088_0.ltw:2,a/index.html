Hi Aur&#xE9;lien,

&gt; - if I run these instances from within ladish, then they're all launched at the
&gt; same time, and then, several of them just won't show up, as they're blocking on
&gt; certains ports creation (not always the same).

Are you using rooms within Ladish? (doesn't sound like it!)

I had the same issues as you describe, but after I started using
'rooms' all of those issues went away, completely.

About a week ago Nedko wrote about this sort of thing on the list.
Ladish sessions tend to not fail (ever), when the clients have been
started within your rooms, rather than the 'studio layer'. It was in
the "[Jack-Devel] jackd1/jackd2: FFADO port name divergence" thread,
about a week ago or so.

Nedko said;

&gt; Your ladish "sessions" will not break if you use ladish rooms. Rooms
&gt; provide well known ports that are then connected to physical ports in
&gt; the studio layer. IIRC ladish currently will refuse to load project into
&gt; room that is missing the "virtual hardware" ports that were saved in
&gt; the project xml. If this happens now, you have to load it into room
&gt; created from correct template. In future ladish should ask you whether
&gt; the missing "virtual hardware" ports should be added to the room where
&gt; you are loading project to.

&gt; If you don't use rooms and your jack graph misses hardware ports that
&gt; were present when the studio was saved, then the the effect will be that
&gt; connections will not be restored. If ports appear at some point (for
&gt; example you plug your usb audio interface), ladish will restore
&gt; connections to the port.

I think these to paragraphs best describe the issues and how to avoid them ;)

So i would recommend putting your clients into rooms, rather than the
studio layer to avoid the problems you are having.  IMO for very large
sessions rooms tend help keep things well defined, organized and easy
to view, as an added bonus.

hope that helps, cheerz
