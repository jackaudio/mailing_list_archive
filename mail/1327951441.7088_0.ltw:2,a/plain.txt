Are you using rooms within Ladish? (doesn't sound like it!)

I had the same issues as you describe, but after I started using
'rooms' all of those issues went away, completely.

About a week ago Nedko wrote about this sort of thing on the list.
Ladish sessions tend to not fail (ever), when the clients have been
started within your rooms, rather than the 'studio layer'. It was in
the "[Jack-Devel] jackd1/jackd2: FFADO port name divergence" thread,
about a week ago or so.

I think these to paragraphs best describe the issues and how to avoid them ;)

So i would recommend putting your clients into rooms, rather than the
studio layer to avoid the problems you are having.  IMO for very large
sessions rooms tend help keep things well defined, organized and easy
to view, as an added bonus.

hope that helps, cheerz
