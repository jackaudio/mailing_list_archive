&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm experiencing quite the same since a litlle time with ladish/jackdbus.
&gt; I'm using a quit complex setup with a big Ardour session on the middle of it.
&gt; Lately, and quit randomly, Ardour just couldn't finish its startup blocking on
&gt; certains ports creation.
&gt; The same, when looking at the logs, it seems that there are a lot of Xruns
&gt; coming at that time, though jack doesn't report any problem, it just seems quite
&gt; unusable.
&gt; Then, I switch to non-mixer, for several reasons, one of them being this
&gt; problem, and here is what it gives:
&gt; I've to run 11 instances of Non-Mixer, each with a big amount of clients/ports
&gt; (btw, I've built jackd2 with the clients = 256 and ports_per_application = 2048).
&gt; - if I run these instances manually (from a command line), and wait for one to
&gt; be ready (ports creation and connection) before lauching the next one,
&gt; everything is fine, and the DSP load is not that high, and the machine works
&gt; correctly ;
&gt; - if I run these instances from within ladish, then they're all launched at the
&gt; same time, and then, several of them just won't show up, as they're blocking on
&gt; certains ports creation (not always the same).
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using jackd2 1.9.8 freshly built from Debian Sources (SID), and I
&gt; experienced the very same with jackd2 1.9.7.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that helps.
&gt; 
&gt; Aur&#xE9;lien


At the end we found that the problem was not in jack2. 

CAn you start jackd in verbose mode and send me a complete log of server side (jadish/jackdbus keeps a log somewhere.)

Thanks.
