Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack for Windows

Good Morning,
 
I recently came upon your web site after reading about the new Harrison Mixbus software. 
I downloaded the windows 32 bit Jack software and installed it. I then edited the target properties as instructed
but I seem to be getting an error when trying to start Port Audio:
 
"the procedure entry point jackctl_parse_driver_params could not be located in the dynamic link library libjackserver.dll"
 
I seem to remember reading something about running a windows sys 32 file to register a driver but nothing seemed to work.
Can you offer me anys uggestions?
 
I opened the Jack Control when the Port Audio failed to start and it seemed to be running but I could not change my Motu driver in Cubase
to Jack.
 
 
 
I appreciate your help,
Brett
