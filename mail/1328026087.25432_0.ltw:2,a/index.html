Hey Aur&#xE9;lien,

&gt; I'm not quite sure it corresponds to my problem (though I'm not sure to
&gt; have understood all that paragraph), but still I'm going to try this.

Well, your problem seems to be on port creation, clients can't find
the ports they are looking for and get blocked/won't start, right? So
by using rooms, you would be adding a layer above the 'studio layer' ~
where the ports will *always* be the same for your clients, so that is
no longer an issue... Then you essentially mainly use the studio layer
for connecting the rooms (virtual) ports to hardware ports. (this is
what i do anyway)

Maybe, i am wrong (and nedko / anyone else -&gt; feel free to just in if
i am) but your problem sounds like the same/similar kind of problems i
had using Ladish before i started using rooms. the symptoms seem
exactly the same... I think the most relevent part of what Nedko was
saying (for your particular case) was here;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your ladish "sessions" will not break if you use ladish rooms. Rooms
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide well known ports that are then connected to physical ports in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the studio layer.

It sounds like you are experiencing some breakage (and likely very
similar, to what i used to run into and what is described above).
these 'well known ports' and the *consistency* they provide is what
has fixed it for me. Clients don't get screwed up because a port isn't
where it is 'supposed' to be (or not present/re-ordered). instead, the
rooms provide a very consistent mapping of the ports for the clients.

&gt; Though, I first discussed that bug with nedko, which seems to think it
&gt; was not ladish side, but more jackdbus side.

Was Nedko aware that you were doing everything in the studio layer?
..and regardless, i would recommend doing as St&#xE9;phane had asked you to
do;

&gt; CAn you start jackd in verbose mode and send me a complete log of server
&gt; side (Ladish/ jackdbus keeps a log somewhere.)

In case, you don't know verbose mode can be turned on through;

ladiconf-&gt;jack engine parameters-&gt;verbose mode  (simply check in the box)

and the logs for Jackdbus and Ladish will be found here;

/home/USERNAME/.log/ladish/ladish.log

/home/USERNAME/.log/jack/jackdbus.log

Just a tip ~ your log files might be huge (going back weeks or more),
if that is the case, simply rename them (to back them up, if you like)
and the next time you start up Ladish, a new log will be created.

&gt; Thanks a lot by the way.

No problem.
