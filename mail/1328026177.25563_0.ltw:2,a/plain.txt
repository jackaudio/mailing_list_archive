Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack for Windows

Have you installed 1.9.8 version ?

It yes then rapid answer is : not supported.

More precisely: MB uses a (new in development) subset of JACK 1.9.9. We try to make possible the installation of full 1.9.9 over MB.

But installing 1.9.8 over MB is problematic.
