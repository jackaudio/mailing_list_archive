Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Is it OK to reserve multiple Jack Midi events at the same frame time?

Hello. Just reviewing our app's jack midi code.
Almost embarrassed to ask, but need to double check to be sure:

Is it OK to reserve multiple jack midi events at the same time frame?
Including events like say patch hi-bank, lo-bank and program controllers, 
 or RPN sequences, all reserved at the same frame time (but reserved 
 in succession)?

If so, I guess it is up to the back-end how fast the events are actually sent 
 at that one particular time frame? IE firewire might send many within 
 one frame, but slower midi interfaces would take more time to do it?

Thanks. Tim.
