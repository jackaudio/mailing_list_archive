Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK1 / JACK2: Application UI behaves differently

Hey All,

I'm experiencing some strange behaviour:
Luppp will run "normally" under JACK1 (which it was developed on) and when
testing using JACK2 the "tracks" in the user interface don't show up.
Pretty wierd in my opinion, I can't really see any error in my own
threading code which might result in this bug...

I'm posting here as I'm aware that JACK2 calls some callbacks in different
threads, but I don't know what implications that has for Luppp.
Advice / suggestions welcomed, Cheers -Harry
