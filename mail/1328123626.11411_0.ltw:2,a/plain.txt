Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK1 / JACK2: Application UI behaves differently

Issue fixed: Apologies Stephane for wasting your time.

JACK1 will repeatedly call process when you return "true" from the process  
function.
JACK2 will call process() *once*, and if you return "true" not call you  
again.

This was stopping my RT thread from inserting the relevant components into  
engine,
and hence not updating the GUI, because the actions weren't being achieved.

Docs contains the following on returning from process():
" Returns:
zero on success, non-zero on error"

Perhaps a note that JACK1 will continue to call you, while JACK2 will not  
would be good?
