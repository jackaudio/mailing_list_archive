Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Can Jack help with this Intel MB DG45ID problem?

People,

This MB has had a known problem with the back Mic and LineIn ports 
being reversed and other tech problems I am not clear about.  In the 
past, there have been special ALSA RPMs to deal with the problem for use 
with Fedora.  More recent versions of Fedora fixed the problems (except 
for the reversed port thing) and I have been using the Mic (LineIn) port 
for recording audio quite happily but now I need BOTH LineIn and Mic and 
I can't get any life out of the LineIn (Mic) port at all.

So the summary is:

PulseAudio is uninstalled.

Plugs are reversed on Intel_MB_DG45ID:

     Pink is LineIn (instead of Mic)
     Blue is Mic (instead of LineIn)

Using:

     arecord --rate=44000 --channels=2 | aplay

to listen directly.

Input plugged into Pink:

XFCE audio mixer:

     Capture:

         Capture:    ~20 %
         Capture1:   0 %
         Digital:    ~40 %
         Rear Mic:   ~70 %

     Options:

         Rear Jack Mic Mode: "Mic In" OR "Line In"

With the Input plugged into Blue I can't get anything but hiss.  I have 
looked at the output of alsa-info but there doesn't seem to be anything 
useful there

Any suggestions about how Jack might help in this situation?

Thanks,

Phil.
