&gt; &gt; Changing the print() calls should be trivial. I dont know other stuff. I
&gt; &gt; don't have python3 installed at all and I dislike how they broke
&gt; &gt; backward compatibility.

That was my initial reaction as well, but I had to review it.

About two years ago I wrote a lot of audio related python2 code,
much of it involving interfacing to C and C++. Then my distro
(Arch) changed its default python from 2 to 3 (they were the
first to do this AFAIK) and everything broke in major ways.
So I decided to convert all that code. Doing that, it turned
out that almost all of the things that broke with python 3
depended on features that had been deprecated and replaced
even in python 2 for a long time. The result is that almost
all of my python 3 code runs unchanged on python 2 as well,
and where it doesn't it's quite easy to provide support for
both.

For *some* features the change from 2 to 3 amounts to a clear
discontinuity, but most had been available in python 2 for a
long time. Where backwards compatibility was lost it was done
for good reasons, and the transition was prepared in much
better ways than some people claim it was. The simple fact
is that much python 2 code is out of date anyway.

In case of pure python code, there's a good chance that
the conversion can be done entirely automatically, see
&lt;http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html&gt;. Even quite
complex toolsets such as numpy have been running with
python3 for at least a year now - they were ready much
earlier than I anticipated.
