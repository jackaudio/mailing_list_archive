Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Problem with Jack Control API in Windows

I am working from the server_control.cpp and Jackdmp.cpp source to try and create a simple Jack application that launches and configures the jack server through the API.

I had to comment out:
#include <stdbool.h> 
and added:
typedef HANDLE sigset_t 

to control.h to get things building and it all seems ok...

but my call:
server_ctl = jackctl_server_create(NULL,NULL)
returns NULL.

I have not been able to get the JACK source building in windows as of yet, so I am working with the binaries available from the web: 32 bit windows installer 1.9.8 from http://jackaudio.org/download

Executing the jackd.exe works fine.

Any ideas why my jackctl_server_create() call is not succeeding?

Thanks,

Chris
