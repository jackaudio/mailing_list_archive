Subject:     [Jack-Devel] crash in jack_thread_touch_stack

hi all,

i had a brief discussion yesterday on irc with paul about a strange crash of my 
application with jack1. my application crashed in a jack-related helper thread 
when enabling real-time scheduling.

after rebuilding the libjack deb, i've now figured out that it crashes inside 
jack_thread_touch_stack. i suppose this is done to avoid page faults in the 
real-time thread, but aparently it can overwrite some other parts, if it wipes 
too much of the stack ...
i am not sure, what is the best solution for this issue, maybe jack should set 
the stack size manually (pthread_attr_setstacksize) before launching the thread?

cheers, tim
