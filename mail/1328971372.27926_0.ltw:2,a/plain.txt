cleaner solutions:

- use pthread_getattr_np or pthread_get_stackaddr_np/pthread_get_stacksize_np to 
  determine stack address
- use a pre-allocated stack via pthread_attr_setstack. you can then touch/mlock 
  the stack, before it is actually created ...

the second solution seems to be cleaner and more powerful, but will require some 
manual cleanup after the client thread terminates ...

cheers, tim
