How: we stop committing to svn and push to github instead. Stephane, you
will need an account there.

When: when you say so. IMO switch to jack-headers and other submodules
is a task that is not strictly bound to the git switch itself.

We've been using git for some time already. Its just that we are going
to stop using git-svn by switching to pure git workflow. And we are
migrating from repo.or.cz repo to github one.

Right now the git repos are updated with latest svn jack2, r4777:
