Hello,

I do have some questions regarding kernel options for a jack friendly
kernel. I've found some information on the net, some outdated, some
maybe not complete. I am talking about a stock vanilla kernel 3.2 with
BFS scheduler, I most likely do not need hard realtime.

While my kernels usually do run, I do not understand all options. Not to
get me wrong, I am not asking to get those explained at all, just would
like to know wether those are jack relevant and should en/disabled.


So a 1000Hz timer and full preemption are quite obvious. A tickless
system is not recommended, IIRC and also hyperthreading should be
disabled in bios as well as kernel? Same with Power management, I suppose.

Is that RCU stuff somehow realted to audio? What about "Enable RCU
priority boosting". Is that recommended to be activated? And is the I/O
scheduler of any relevance? I an mot going to record 52 tracks at once.

Also I do filter access to /dev/mem below "kernel hacking". That should
not matter, should it? Anything I might have missed?

Finally, not really kernel related, but what is about irq-balancer? I've
attached "threadirqs" to my lilo line - there is no dedicated kernel
option for threadirqs? - do threadirqs and irq-balancer they play well
together or should latter one be removed?

Hopefully this is not too off topic.
