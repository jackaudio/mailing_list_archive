Hi Ede,

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I do have some questions regarding kernel options for a jack friendly
&gt; kernel. I've found some information on the net, some outdated, some
&gt; maybe not complete. I am talking about a stock vanilla kernel 3.2 with
&gt; BFS scheduler,

I've only tested BFS in the late linux-2.6. days. It performed very well
but could not compete with RT_PREEMT under heavy load wrt low-latency
audio. YMMV.

&gt; I most likely do not need hard realtime.
&gt; 
&gt; While my kernels usually do run, I do not understand all options. 

There's probably no one out there who can tell how _all_ those options
affect each other and what effect they have on the system :)

&gt; Not to
&gt; get me wrong, I am not asking to get those explained at all, just would
&gt; like to know wether those are jack relevant and should en/disabled.

none of them are relevant for JACK per se; I assume you want a tuned
reliable audio-system.

&gt; So a 1000Hz timer and full preemption are quite obvious. 

N/A and yes. (the 1kHZ timer is motivated mostly by MIDI I/O; I'm unsure
if it is still relevant with jack-midi - but it won't hurt. jackd
backends use the audio-hardware IRQ for timing; NTL ALSA-sequencer apps
will run with less jitter with a higher precision system timer.)

&gt; A tickless system is not recommended.

well, no. A tickless system just replaces the periodic timer interrupt
with on-demand interrupts. The response time is basically identical; but
the power-consumption is drastically reduced. They system can also do
other things instead of handling some unused timer-irq but the effect of
that is marginal.

CONFIG_NO_HZ=y
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y

&gt; IIRC and also hyperthreading should be disabled in bios as well as kernel? 
In general: no. leave it enabled.

It helps to increase parallelism for I/O bound (non-CPU intensive)
threads. It may have to be "yes" for you, because BFS may not /aware/ of
HT features when it schedules context-switches. The scheduler needs to
realize that the two logical CPUs belong to the same physical CPU. I
don't know if BFS cares about that. In general one needs a shared
runqueue per physical-CPU for HT-scheduling; yet one of the BFS features
is to only use a single runqueue for the entire system.

&gt; Same with Power management, I suppose.
In general, yes.

but it's not that simple: for maximum reliability, you want to run the
machine as cool as possible which also produces less [fan] noise. Also
if you're on a mobile system, with power-mgmt the battery will last much
longer.

CPU freq changes are fast enough and not an issue for audio
applications, but PCI/PCIexpress power management can screw up
low-latency I/O. Alas, this differs from board-to-board and
bios-to-bios. Check if you can disable C1E halt state and EIST in the
BIOS. Other power-management options are usually not an issue.

&gt; Is that RCU stuff somehow realted to audio? What about "Enable RCU
&gt; priority boosting". Is that recommended to be activated? And is the I/O
&gt; scheduler of any relevance? I an mot going to record 52 tracks at once.

mmh. IIRC there were (or are) implementation issues with the locking
model of RCU WRT to low-latency. I did not follow up the details but it
works fine and reliable with the -rt patch on i686 and x64_64 here with
2.6.39 and 3.X

CONFIG_TREE_PREEMPT_RCU=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y
CONFIG_RCU_BOOST=y


&gt; Also I do filter access to /dev/mem below "kernel hacking". That should
&gt; not matter, should it? Anything I might have missed?

not that I'm aware of.

&gt; Finally, not really kernel related, but what is about irq-balancer? I've
&gt; attached "threadirqs" to my lilo line - there is no dedicated kernel
&gt; option for threadirqs? - do threadirqs and irq-balancer they play well
&gt; together or should latter one be removed?

/sbin/irqbalance is a daemon. - "threadirqs" is a kernel option.
They work in combination. However it is questionable if balancing IRQs
on a single hyperthreaded core makes sense.

You'll definitely want to use "threadirqs" to increase the priority of
audio-device-IRQ handlers over other interrupt handlers. Rui's rtirq
script can configure IRQ priorities during boot for kernels with
threaded IRQ handlers.

`hwlatdetect` and other tools from the "rt-tests" suite do come in handy
to check system and kernel latencies.

&gt; Hopefully this is not too off topic.

it's a recurring on-topic subject at

have fun,
robin
