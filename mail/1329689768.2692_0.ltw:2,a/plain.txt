I found that the sound card you use has a lot to do with it.  I 
drastically reduced XRUNs by getting a new sound card.  This helped much 
more than any kernel options I tried.  I had a Soundblaster Live 24-bit 
before (was OK latency wise), as well as onboard auduio (not very good 
latencies).  I then got a Xonar D1 and don't have latency problems anymore.

I use BFS too, btw.  An RT kernel didn't help much.

Tickless and HT are fine.  Power management can be tweaked at runtime, 
no need to disable it in the kernel.  You can switch your CPU(s) to 
performance mode with:

   cpufreq-set -r -g performance

You can see what the current mode is with:

   cpufreq-info

Don't know about irq-balancer, but threadirqs definitely helps here with 
XRUNs.
