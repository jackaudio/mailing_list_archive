Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack 1.9.8 on Windows patchbay question

I've got Jack v1.9.8 running successfully on Win7 and I have a need to use
the QJackCtl patchbay functionality to enforce connections via an "active"
profile.  This is all working fine.

Now, I'd like to copy this setup to other Win7 machines.  I'd like to copy
the .xml file where the patchbay connections are defined.  In Windows this
file doesn't seem to actually exist in the filesystem, although
loading/saving such file via QJC GUI does invoke the Win7 file dialog.

Is this a real file that I could copy to another machine?  If so, where
does it live?  If not, is there some other straightforward way for me to
achieve my goal of enforcing some connection setup that is easy copied to
other machines in Windows?

Thanks in advance,
Rick
