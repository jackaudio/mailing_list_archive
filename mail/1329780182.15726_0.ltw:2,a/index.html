&gt; I've got Jack v1.9.8 running successfully on Win7 and I have a need to
&gt; use the QJackCtl patchbay functionality to enforce connections via an
&gt; "active" profile.  This is all working fine.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I'd like to copy this setup to other Win7 machines.  I'd like to
&gt; copy the .xml file where the patchbay connections are defined.  In
&gt; Windows this file doesn't seem to actually exist in the filesystem,
&gt; although loading/saving such file via QJC GUI does invoke the Win7 file
&gt; dialog.
&gt;
&gt; Is this a real file that I could copy to another machine?  If so, where
&gt; does it live?  If not, is there some other straightforward way for me to
&gt; achieve my goal of enforcing some connection setup that is easy copied
&gt; to other machines in Windows?
&gt;

it's a plain regular file (.xml), no doubt

if it invokes the common win7 file requester dialog you'll certainly 
have the option to locate the precise file name and folder (or 
directory) where it gets saved or loaded

alas, &#xED;'m not the least familiar with win7. in fact i have not touched a 
win7 box yet, can you believe that? :) but it seems completely 
unbelievable to me that win7 doesn't give you the slightest clue that 
you're dealing with regular files and folders, as usual o.O
