it's a plain regular file (.xml), no doubt

if it invokes the common win7 file requester dialog you'll certainly 
have the option to locate the precise file name and folder (or 
directory) where it gets saved or loaded

alas, Ã­'m not the least familiar with win7. in fact i have not touched a 
win7 box yet, can you believe that? :) but it seems completely 
unbelievable to me that win7 doesn't give you the slightest clue that 
you're dealing with regular files and folders, as usual o.O
