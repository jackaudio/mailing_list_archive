In-Reply-To: Rick Wright [Jack-Devel] Jack 1.9.8 on Windows patchbay question (1329774735.11293_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack 1.9.8 on Windows patchbay question

Hi Rick,

When saving a patchpay configuration in Jack Control you got the
option to save the file wherever you wanted to in the Save Patchbay
dialogue screen... if you did not make any changes in the file
location then it will be in your Jack Installation directory
(typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack). Your patchbay configuration
file will typically be a .xml file in that directory.

Remember that a default Windows Explorer configuration automatically
hides file extensions, so you won't see the .xml unless you configure
Windows Explorer to not hide the file extensions.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
