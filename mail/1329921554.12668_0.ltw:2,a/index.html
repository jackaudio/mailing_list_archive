Thanks to all for your time &amp; insight. Also to those who do not get cited
here.

The reason for BFS was not really audio, but more, it doesn't suck as much
as the regular scheduler for I/O, which by time tends to [b]lock the whole
system for a couple of seconds.

I will be building a dedicated audio system somewhat soon, currently my
ordinary workstation has to do the job. Maybe that'll get an RT kernel
anyway.
But I'll recheck with HT and BFS. That was a tremendous hint.

The mention of fan noise is actually a really good one, haven't thought
about this, but I'll try to get the didecated system silet from start. Not
sure, wether I succeed, as I am not really following the hardware
business.

Oh, and I do have two cores, but both are HT, so irqbalancer isn't a bad
option, I suppose.

Again, thanks for your explanations. I'll try PREEMPT RCU with next kernel
baking.

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I do have some questions regarding kernel options for a jack friendly
&gt;&gt; kernel. I've found some information on the net, some outdated, some
&gt;&gt; maybe not complete. I am talking about a stock vanilla kernel 3.2 with
&gt;&gt; BFS scheduler,
&gt;
&gt; I've only tested BFS in the late linux-2.6. days. It performed very well
&gt; but could not compete with RT_PREEMT under heavy load wrt low-latency
&gt; audio. YMMV.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I most likely do not need hard realtime.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; While my kernels usually do run, I do not understand all options.
&gt;
&gt; There's probably no one out there who can tell how _all_ those options
&gt; affect each other and what effect they have on the system :)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not to
&gt;&gt; get me wrong, I am not asking to get those explained at all, just would
&gt;&gt; like to know wether those are jack relevant and should en/disabled.
&gt;
&gt; none of them are relevant for JACK per se; I assume you want a tuned
&gt; reliable audio-system.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; So a 1000Hz timer and full preemption are quite obvious.
&gt;
&gt; N/A and yes. (the 1kHZ timer is motivated mostly by MIDI I/O; I'm unsure
&gt; if it is still relevant with jack-midi - but it won't hurt. jackd
&gt; backends use the audio-hardware IRQ for timing; NTL ALSA-sequencer apps
&gt; will run with less jitter with a higher precision system timer.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; A tickless system is not recommended.
&gt;
&gt; well, no. A tickless system just replaces the periodic timer interrupt
&gt; with on-demand interrupts. The response time is basically identical; but
&gt; the power-consumption is drastically reduced. They system can also do
&gt; other things instead of handling some unused timer-irq but the effect of
&gt; that is marginal.
&gt;
&gt; CONFIG_NO_HZ=y
&gt; CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y
&gt;
&gt;&gt; IIRC and also hyperthreading should be disabled in bios as well as
&gt;&gt; kernel?
&gt; In general: no. leave it enabled.
&gt;
&gt; It helps to increase parallelism for I/O bound (non-CPU intensive)
&gt; threads. It may have to be "yes" for you, because BFS may not /aware/ of
&gt; HT features when it schedules context-switches. The scheduler needs to
&gt; realize that the two logical CPUs belong to the same physical CPU. I
&gt; don't know if BFS cares about that. In general one needs a shared
&gt; runqueue per physical-CPU for HT-scheduling; yet one of the BFS features
&gt; is to only use a single runqueue for the entire system.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Same with Power management, I suppose.
&gt; In general, yes.
&gt;
&gt; but it's not that simple: for maximum reliability, you want to run the
&gt; machine as cool as possible which also produces less [fan] noise. Also
&gt; if you're on a mobile system, with power-mgmt the battery will last much
&gt; longer.
&gt;
&gt; CPU freq changes are fast enough and not an issue for audio
&gt; applications, but PCI/PCIexpress power management can screw up
&gt; low-latency I/O. Alas, this differs from board-to-board and
&gt; bios-to-bios. Check if you can disable C1E halt state and EIST in the
&gt; BIOS. Other power-management options are usually not an issue.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is that RCU stuff somehow realted to audio? What about "Enable RCU
&gt;&gt; priority boosting". Is that recommended to be activated? And is the I/O
&gt;&gt; scheduler of any relevance? I an mot going to record 52 tracks at once.
&gt;
&gt; mmh. IIRC there were (or are) implementation issues with the locking
&gt; model of RCU WRT to low-latency. I did not follow up the details but it
&gt; works fine and reliable with the -rt patch on i686 and x64_64 here with
&gt; 2.6.39 and 3.X
&gt;
&gt; CONFIG_TREE_PREEMPT_RCU=y
&gt; CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y
&gt; CONFIG_RCU_BOOST=y
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also I do filter access to /dev/mem below "kernel hacking". That should
&gt;&gt; not matter, should it? Anything I might have missed?
&gt;
&gt; not that I'm aware of.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Finally, not really kernel related, but what is about irq-balancer? I've
&gt;&gt; attached "threadirqs" to my lilo line - there is no dedicated kernel
&gt;&gt; option for threadirqs? - do threadirqs and irq-balancer they play well
&gt;&gt; together or should latter one be removed?
&gt;
&gt; /sbin/irqbalance is a daemon. - "threadirqs" is a kernel option.
&gt; They work in combination. However it is questionable if balancing IRQs
&gt; on a single hyperthreaded core makes sense.
&gt;
&gt; You'll definitely want to use "threadirqs" to increase the priority of
&gt; audio-device-IRQ handlers over other interrupt handlers. Rui's rtirq
&gt; script can configure IRQ priorities during boot for kernels with
&gt; threaded IRQ handlers.
&gt;
&gt; `hwlatdetect` and other tools from the "rt-tests" suite do come in handy
&gt; to check system and kernel latencies.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hopefully this is not too off topic.
&gt;
&gt; it's a recurring on-topic subject at
&gt; http://lists.linuxaudio.org/listinfo/linux-audio-dev
&gt;
&gt; have fun,
&gt; robin
