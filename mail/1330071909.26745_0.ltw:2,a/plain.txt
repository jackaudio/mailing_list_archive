Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Playing multiple sounds at the same time

Hello,

I'm quite new to Jack and enjoy developing with it as far as I went.
I have a design question about playing 2 sound sources (ie 2 sound files or sound file + audio input capture) at the same time.
Should I create 2 jack clients or mux the 2 sounds in the processData callback ?

What is the best practice on this ?

Regards
