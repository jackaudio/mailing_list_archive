yup. fine with me.

This stuff is not necessary.
the signal handling is an implementation detail, and should be hidden
below the control api.

jack1 controlapi.c is doing it correctly. 
please switch jack2 to doing the same thing.

why is that sensible ?
what does jack dbus need commandline parsing for, to configure a driver
?

commandline parsing is special to jackd implementation, and doesnt
belong here.

big NAK from me.

needed for ladish used by jackdbus.
we should add it to jack1. 

however, this should really have jack_client_t as parameter too.
or jackctl_server_t 
in jack1 we need access to engine struct, to implement it.

i dont remember. 
there should only be one canonical port type representation.
i dont like it.
