Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Playing multiple sounds at the same time

Hello,

Thanks for your answer.
The easiest way would be for me to create 2 clients in my code but I might need multiplexing sources at some point.
Can someone point me to some tutorial or documentation on how to mux samples from different buffers to "merge" them on a single output ?

Regards
