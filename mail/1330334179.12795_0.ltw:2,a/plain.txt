i fail to understand, why this justifies this splitup.
it seems that, in order to add slave drivers, the server needs to be
opened ? 

and because the implementation is lacking support for adding slaves
while the server is running, you need to add them in between.

the implementation in jack1 is equally bad. we even lack the controlapi
bits. however... i dont see why we cant just save a proper list of slave
drivers in the jackctl_server_t which are then instantiated during
server start.

Adding a slave while the server is running would just return false,
until there is a proper implementation.
