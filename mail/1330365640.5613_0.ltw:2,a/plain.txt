IIRC, 'jackctl_server_open' instantiates the master audio driver.
Calls to 'jackctl_server_add_slave' instantiate slave drivers, each of
which is added to the master driver.

AFAIK, there isn't really a reason, save that some of the internal
structures would have to be changed in JACK 2.

However, that doesn't mean your idea is necessarily better.  There
would still need to be functionality to add and remove the master
driver.  You could make the case that the calls could be renamed to
'jackctl_server_add_master' and 'jackctl_server_remove_master'.  Since
the server requires a master driver to run, I think that the
'jackctl_server_open' and 'jackctl_server_close' names are just fine.
