The second call is for reporting the jack version in the jackdbus log
file. jackd uses the internal macro VERSION instead.

jack_get_version_string() is also required for reporting jack server
version over dbus. I want this information to be present somewhere in
gladish (the GUI frontend bundled in the ladish tarball).

As for the first function I'm all for feature based tests but we
dont really have this in the API yet. jackdbus doesnt use nor exports
the major/minor/micro/proto data over dbus. At least not yet.

ladish L0 jack client to app mapping is built around this.

jackdbus uses it to report [integer] port types over dbus.
