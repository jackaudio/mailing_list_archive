Diagnostics. Why its reported to stdout early in jackd code? Its the
same.

I cant recall why we decided like this with iuso back then. I can guess
that one reason could be that comparing integers is faster. Also its
more bandwidth efficient. There are jackdbus users that work with huge
number of ports. And it has to stay like this in dbus patchbay interface
for compatibility reasons. If we are going to remove integer port types
From the C API, then jackdbus will have to either do string compares on
each port creation event or we should guarantee that jack_port_type()
returns unique string pointers that can be compared as integers.
