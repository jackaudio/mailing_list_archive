i dont see why slave drivers must be children of the master driver. 
but this is an implementation detail anyways. 

jack1 slave drivers are just a list of slaver drivers in the engine.

implementation detail. i dont think it justifies an API change.

we already have a call that changes the master driver.

/**
 * Call this function to switch master driver.
 *
 * @param server server object handle
 * @param driver driver to switch to
 *
 * @return success status: true - success, false - fail
 */
bool
jackctl_server_switch_master(jackctl_server_t * server,
                            jackctl_driver_t * driver);


i think i begin to understand, what happened here:

- jack2 requires an instantiated master driver to be able to add slave
  drivers.

- its not possible to change slave drivers, while the engine is up and
  running.

The splitup of the control api seems to be a bandaid, which papers over
these problems with the implementation. 

IFF these 2 Problems would be fixed in the implementation (which is
really not so hard) would you still need this splitup ?
