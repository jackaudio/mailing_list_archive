Subject:     [Jack-Devel] update jack from 1.9.7 to 1.9.8

Hi,
I'am learning to build the latest jack-Version in a little Radiostation.
We use several ubuntumachines with jack from the repos.

On one machine (ubuntu 11.04, 32Bit, jackdmp 1.9.7, Ardour 2.8.11, Alsa
Sound) after Export from Ardour, jack report this error:

JackPosixSemaphore::TimedWait err = Connection timed out
JackFreewheelDriver::ProcessSync SuspendRefNum error

And Ardour freezes.

On another machine (ubuntu 11.10, 64Bit, jackdmp 1.9.7, Ardour 2.8.11,
Firewire) after Export from Ardour, jack report this error:

JackClient::AcquireRealTime error
firewire ERR: Could not start streaming threads
Cannot start driver

Here, I can use Ardour again when I disconnect from jack and restart
qjackctl.

I hope both will be fix with jack 1.9.8.!?

My Questions:

jack is installed on both machines in /usr/bin

Must I type
./waf configure --prefix /usr
or
./waf configure --prefix /usr/bin

And "find" the install alsa and firewire or have I type it additionally
in the configure command?

Thanks for newbe-help
Jörg
