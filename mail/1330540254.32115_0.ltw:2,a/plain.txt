WTF?

Give it a whirl, it's available. It's also available from Debian if you
don't want to compile manually.

Speaking of which: you can also grab the Debian sources and recompile on
your Ubuntu machine if you worry about dependencies:

   # apt-get build-dep jackd2
   # apt-get install devscripts
   $ debcheckout jackd2
   $ cd jackd2 && git-buildpackage -uc -us

Maybe the ubuntustudio guys already did that.

For jackd2, you have to say --alsa. And you need to have libasound2-dev
installed.


Last not least: Also try jackd1, it's a completely different codebase,
though I'm sure sletz would like to learn what's wrong with your jackd2
installations. ;)
