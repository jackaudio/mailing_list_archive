sorry, thank for your patience. here are the terminal-messages from:
/usr/bin/jackd -v -u -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p1024 -n2

(this is not the "firewire-machine")
What have I do:
start jack
start jackctrl
start jamin
start ardour with existing project
export ardour project

the cursor in ardour begins for a few milimeters to scroll, then hangs
ardour. I've to kill ardour, it is not closeable in the gui.

ubuntu 11.04 with onboardsound

I guess it have to do with the freewheel-mode..
