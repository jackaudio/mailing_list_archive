sorry for my stupid usage!
Now I've done this in the 1.9.9.-Dir:

sudo rm /usr/lib/jack/jack_firewire.so
./waf configure --prefix=/usr --alsa
./waf build
sudo ./waf install

The build was without the long output-messages like the first try.
But the following command tells, that 1.9.8. exist and fail!???
