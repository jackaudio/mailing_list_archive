Which means we're lacking documentation.

   http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/GIT_Server#Occasional_Developers

is so good for the occasional developer.

For jack, it boils down to mention

   git-format-patch -n -s -p

and

   git-send-email

somewhere.

Alternatively, we should establish a workflow based on pull requests.


But the patches we just got are the worst possible way to do it. No
attribution to the author, no commit message, no automatic integration.

That said, part of the decision to host the repos at github was to
encourage contributions from others, so let's make sure to make the
submission process as convenient as possible for all of us.

If I was about to cast a vote, then it'd be

   [x] document the git send-email approach as ALSA did it
   [x] also use pull requests and maybe discuss the patches on the ML
       before merging


Cheers
