It doesn't get better if you blindly do the same mistakes over and over
again.

Firstly, there's no use in showing a German error message to a French
developer. Ok, you got a segfault when starting jackd. Congrats, this
rarely happens.

You've either found a new bug (rather unlikely) or some sort of
misconfiguration.

The most prominent problem are partial installations. You have to get
rid of your previous jackd installation, ideally remove the entire
package.

You should at least remove

    /usr/lib/libjack*

and the entire

    /usr/lib/jack/

directory.

Maybe those libs reside in /usr/lib/some-triplet/ if you have MultiArch,
in my case

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjack* and

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jack/*


Second possible source for a segfault at startup was an early load of
the pulseaudio modules. I never bothered to carefully investigate, since
a temporary chmod -x /usr/bin/pulseaudio before starting jackd fixed the
problem for me. But I guess it's very unlikely that you're facing the
same problem. If jackd -d dummy works, but jackd -d alsa doesn't, then
you might be affected.
