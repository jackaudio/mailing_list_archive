Ah, great, thanks for the feedback!

I see, yes, I'm running into problems building packages with --mixed 
mode, something to do with multilib support in my build environment for 
Fedora (multilib, argh!).

Could you tell me what is it you are doing to build packages in the case 
of Ubuntu? (a pointer to any scripts or anything like that would 
probably be enough).

Thanks again.
