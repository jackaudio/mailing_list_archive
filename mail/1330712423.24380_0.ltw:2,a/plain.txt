Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Compiling QjackCtl 0.3.8 on Windows

Hello!

I compiled QjackCtl 0.3.8 a months ago but I got some bugs when using it
with jackd. Also, the file size were too big. If you can compile successful
I'll really apreciated if you can give some some tips. I used Qt Creator on
Windows XP.

Cheers!
