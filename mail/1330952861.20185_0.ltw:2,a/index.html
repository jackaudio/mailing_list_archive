&gt; Hi,

Hi!

&gt; i'm looking for good solutions for connecting audio applications
&gt; across different platforms and PCs. I was wondering, if it would be
&gt; possible to connect Jack directly through Firewire, without using the
&gt; TCP/IP protocol.

Sort of, yes. Maybe you want to have a look at FFADO. I don't know if
everything is already implemented, but the building blocks are there.
What you basically do is AMDTP.

Discovery/announcement might need some work.

&gt; The problem with ethernet is, that it consumes too much cpu.

Really? What do you do? Technically, it's not so different whether you
stuff the PCM samples into a firewire or ethernet packet. Firewire has
the upside of a common bus clock, but this is only important if you
intend to use audio interfaces on the individual nodes.

Did you try netjack in "don't convert anything" mode? (floats and -e)

&gt; I thought it should be possible to have PCs act like virtual
&gt; Firewire Audio Interfaces.

I guess it's possible, yes. But OTOH, I'm pretty sure it doesn't work
out of the box.

&gt; Would it be possible for the Jack Team to develop that kinda thing for
&gt; Windows and Mac?

I'm afraid it would not. If you need it, it's very likely up to you to
do it.

And then you discover that Ethernet/AVB is what you really want. ;)
