Sort of, yes. Maybe you want to have a look at FFADO. I don't know if
everything is already implemented, but the building blocks are there.
What you basically do is AMDTP.

Discovery/announcement might need some work.

Really? What do you do? Technically, it's not so different whether you
stuff the PCM samples into a firewire or ethernet packet. Firewire has
the upside of a common bus clock, but this is only important if you
intend to use audio interfaces on the individual nodes.

Did you try netjack in "don't convert anything" mode? (floats and -e)

I guess it's possible, yes. But OTOH, I'm pretty sure it doesn't work
out of the box.

I'm afraid it would not. If you need it, it's very likely up to you to
do it.

And then you discover that Ethernet/AVB is what you really want. ;)
