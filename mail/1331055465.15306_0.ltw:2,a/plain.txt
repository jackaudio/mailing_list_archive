Ahh,
the standard is:
libraw1394 2.0.7-1
libffado 2.999.0- built Oct 10 2011 08:11:23

and it seems it's up to date!?

On http://www.ffado.org/?q=node/516
I read from gscanbus, but it don't work on my machine:
Error while reading from IEEE1394: : Resource temporarily unavailable

But 1394 works fine with jack until I export from ardour...
