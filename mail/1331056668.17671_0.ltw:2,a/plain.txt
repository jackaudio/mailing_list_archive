As we've learned from one of your previous mails, you are using r1995 of
FFADO. This is sufficiently recent enough, because the freewheeling
problem exists in all versions.

Same happens if you try to change the buffer size with jack_bufsize, it
will kill jackd.

I've tried it with FFADO trunk as of today. What happens behind the
curtain:

   - ffado_streaming_stop() is called in engine->driver->stop()
   - ffado_streaming_start() is called in engine->driver->start()

The latter doesn't work, maybe because the stop() command does not what
it is supposed to do.

Somebody would have to investigate it, it's clearly a problem in FFADO.

We need to fix it anyway if we want to support jack_bufsize one day.


In other words: unless you dig into FFADO's code, there's nothing that
will fix the problem.

Forget about gscanbus, it's not related.
