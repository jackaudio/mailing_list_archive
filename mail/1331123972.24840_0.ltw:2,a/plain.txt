Thanks a lot Rui.

I finally succeeded compiling the project directly from QT Creator (which is just fine...). The resulting QjackCtl works fine, but for some reason the start logic has changed a bit. if a just put "jackd -S" in server path, then QjackCtl tries to start "c:/Windows/system32/jackd.exe", which is wrong. I would like QjackCtl to just use the jackd.exe that is located in the same folder where QjackCtl is. This was working this way before. I can use a complete path, but this is not so practical. 

Is there a way to get back to the old way? An option at compilation time? Or will I need to hack the "start jackd" code?

Thanks.

Stéphane
