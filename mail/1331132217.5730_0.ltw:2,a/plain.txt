gosh! lookout for those #ifdef WIN32's in qjackctlMainForm.cpp

most suspicious are that kind that appears in
qtractorMainForm::startJack() ... for which a lookup through the PATH
environment variable takes place when the server executable path (nee
server prefix on svn trunk) is given in relative terms ("jackd" vs.
"drive:/path/to/jackd.exe"
