OK . Basically commenting this block, it works again.

if (fi.isRelative()) {
	#if defined(WIN32)
		const char chPathSep = ';';
		if (fi.suffix().isEmpty())
			sCommand += ".exe";
	#else
		const char chPathSep = ':';
	#endif
		const QString sPath = ::getenv("PATH");
		QStringList paths = sPath.split(chPathSep);
		QStringListIterator iter(paths);
		while (iter.hasNext()) {
			const QString& sDirectory = iter.next();
			fi.setFile(QDir(sDirectory), sCommand);
			if (fi.isExecutable()) {
				sCommand = fi.filePath();
				break;
			}
		}
	}

But now I have a "non systematic" crash when I quit QjackCtl with the server running. It crashes in  qjackctlMainForm::jackCleanup , for instance in :

	appendMessages(tr("JACK was stopped")
			+ formatExitStatus(m_pJack->exitCode()));

or when deleting the m_pJack.
	
Basically it sees the m_pJack is just NULL . Here is a backtrace.

Any idea?
