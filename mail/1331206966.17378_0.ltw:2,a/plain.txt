Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] FFADO issues after freewheeling (was: Re: update jack from 1.9.7 to 1.9.8)

this isn'tt true. during freewheeling, a physical backend is generally
going to be stopped and ignored until freewheeling stops. the device
can't be used, and since it is normally the device that drives the
entire cycle of processing, things looks fairly different when
freewheeling.
