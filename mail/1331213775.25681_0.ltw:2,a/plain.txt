FFADO isn't aware of freewheeling as such.  However, when freewheeling is
started the backend streaming is stopped for the reasons Paul mentioned. 
When jack is taken out of freewheeling the backend is restarted again. 
FFADO sees the stop/start cycle but doesn't know (or care) that this is
because of freewheeling.

I would expect that if FFADO drivers have difficulties with freewheeling it
will generally be when jack is taken out of freewheeling mode.  Stopping the
streaming (moving into freewheeling) is well debugged since it has to happen
when FFADO is closed down.  It's the path involving the restart of streaming
with previously used objects that has seen much less testing (and it's
something I never even thought of testing until this subject came up).
