Yes, there are drivers for this card. (i have one of these lying around).

As far as latencies, you won't get it under 128frames/2periods. As far
as how well the card works; mileage will vary. For example, on one
machine i cannot get it to use the USB2.0 interface, and instead am
forced to use USB1.0, which means you will only be able to use a max
sample rate of 48000. While on my old machine, *sometimes* i can use
USB2.0, in that case i could use 96000 sample rate, without issue.
However, in practice, it isn't always recognized by echi-hcd (usb2.0
driver), so i often have to unload the tascam driver, unplug, then
reload tascam driver again, until it is recognized. (which is a pain).
Nor can i leave the device plugged in on boot, otherwise it spits a
bunch of errors, and my system won't boot until i unplug the device.
then after it boots i can plug it back in (another annoyance).

That being said, when i use the USB1.0 interface, the soundcard works
alright with jack. I didn't have a huge problem with xruns, etc. But
all in all, i personally don't like this card (or any tascam under
linux, that i've seen). Nor would i recommend them.

If you are using a desktop PC, i would look into getting a
well-supported pci-soundcard or firewire device... If using a laptop,
i would probably go with a well-supported (by FFADO) firewire
soundcard, over using USB (unless you can find a good soundcard, that
is well-supported, using USB2.0).

my 2 cents
