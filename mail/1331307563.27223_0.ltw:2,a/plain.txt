Has the head or trunk of jack switched fully to git now?  I have been
building jackdmp from svn, and it appears to not be updated for a couple
of weeks now.

Can someone update the page http://jackaudio.org/download with
instructions on how to get the latest from git rather than svn?  I'm not
familiar with github or using git in general, so some simple command line
examples of how to get the latest changes into my compile directory would
be appreciated.

thanks,
Chris Caudle
