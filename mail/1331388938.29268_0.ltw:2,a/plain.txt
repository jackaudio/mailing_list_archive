Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Removable Devices / Soundcards

Hello,

upon connection of my USB microphone udev runs a script that creates the
nessecary alsa_in devices. Works fine so far and astonishing stable.
Haven't tried with high load, though.

However, when I unplug the microphone in cold blood, alsa_in kinda
zombiefies and cpu usage goes up to 100% - somethig that is somehow
comprehendable.

So again udev runs a script upon removal to plain killall -9 alsa_in.

Now I wonder, is there a graceful way to close alsa_in manually before
disconnecting? Not sure, wether all application will be happy when
simply killing an input port.

Even more, when using another soundcard with alsa_in, that would be
killed to, what may not be desired. So being able to selectively shut
down ports could be useful here, too.

Is that currently possible?
