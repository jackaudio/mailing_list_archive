Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK Crashing Web Browser

Thanks for the work done on this software.
I am running ubuntu 11.10 and I broadcast to an icecast2 server 
using*I*nternet *DJ C*onsole and JACK.
I am finding that when I go to the website 
http://www.endeavoracademy.com/online-classes to check levels of the 
broadcast it freezes the browser than I have to close it.

I got a response from the IDJC maker:
"IDJC uses JACK Audio Connection Kit which locks out standard ALSA sound
sources from directly using the sound card. The Flash plugin may be doing
the wrong thing when its audio is blocked like going off the rails."

All i know is that I have 5 differnent browsers and I have removed and 
re-installed JACK. Still no change.

Love to hear what you think.

Thanks
