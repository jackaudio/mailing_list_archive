Thank you for your thorough description. I think I will wait then,
get more money
and build a more professional setup with firewire. 

By
the way, this issue with the device being plugged in while booting can
be
resolved by a firmware update according to some other forums that I
read
some days ago. Sorry, I can't find the link. I remember though that
there were
links to the official tascam site from where new firmware can
be downloaded:
http://tascam.com/product/us-122l/downloads/ [1] .
Surprisingly there's no firmware
updater for Linux. :-)

&gt;&gt; I'm planning on buying an external sound card.
I recently discovered that our local music shop offers a Tascam us-122L
with a reasonable price. It has all the features that I currently need.
Also, at first glance it seems that there exists drivers for it on
Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, there are drivers for this card. (i have one of these
lying around).
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Do you have any experiences with this card and
Jack? Glitches, noises, latencies? Not working at all? Working
perfectly? Does it worth the money if used on Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; As far as
latencies, you won't get it under 128frames/2periods. As far
&gt; as how
well the card works; mileage will vary. For example, on one
&gt; machine i
cannot get it to use the USB2.0 interface, and instead am
&gt; forced to
use USB1.0, which means you will only be able to use a max
&gt; sample rate
of 48000. While on my old machine, *sometimes* i can use
&gt; USB2.0, in
that case i could use 96000 sample rate, without issue.
&gt; However, in
practice, it isn't always recognized by echi-hcd (usb2.0
&gt; driver), so i
often have to unload the tascam driver, unplug, then
&gt; reload tascam
driver again, until it is recognized. (which is a pain).
&gt; Nor can i
leave the device plugged in on boot, otherwise it spits a
&gt; bunch of
errors, and my system won't boot until i unplug the device.
&gt; then after
it boots i can plug it back in (another annoyance).
&gt; 
&gt; That being
said, when i use the USB1.0 interface, the soundcard works
&gt; alright
with jack. I didn't have a huge problem with xruns, etc. But
&gt; all in
all, i personally don't like this card (or any tascam under
&gt; linux,
that i've seen). Nor would i recommend them.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are using a
desktop PC, i would look into getting a
&gt; well-supported pci-soundcard
or firewire device... If using a laptop,
&gt; i would probably go with a
well-supported (by FFADO) firewire
&gt; soundcard, over using USB (unless
you can find a good soundcard, that
&gt; is well-supported, using
USB2.0).
&gt; 
&gt; my 2 cents
