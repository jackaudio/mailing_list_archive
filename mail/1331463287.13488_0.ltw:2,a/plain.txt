Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Tascam 122L USB soundcard, what are your experiences?

 

Thank you for your thorough description. I think I will wait then,
get more money
and build a more professional setup with firewire. 

By
the way, this issue with the device being plugged in while booting can
be
resolved by a firmware update according to some other forums that I
read
some days ago. Sorry, I can't find the link. I remember though that
there were
links to the official tascam site from where new firmware can
be downloaded:
http://tascam.com/product/us-122l/downloads/ [1] .
Surprisingly there's no firmware
updater for Linux. :-)

I recently discovered that our local music shop offers a Tascam us-122L
with a reasonable price. It has all the features that I currently need.
Also, at first glance it seems that there exists drivers for it on
Linux.
