If your setup relies on the ALSA JACK plugin to coerce ALSA-aware
applications to route PCM via JACK, and you are having problems with
firefox then you'll need disable JACK's memory locking as the javascript
engine's garbage collection implementation ignores the return values
from madvise which can lead to browser lockups and heavy CPU
consumption: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=660960
