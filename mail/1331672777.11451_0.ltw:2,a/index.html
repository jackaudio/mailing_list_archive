&gt; &gt; Paul didn't give any reasons why freewheeling is implemented that way,
&gt; &gt; and I'm somewhat surprised it is. To me the simplest way to do it
&gt; &gt; would be:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. The RT thread that normally calls the backend's 'wait for next cycle'
&gt; &gt; function continues to do so, it feeds silence to the backend and discards
&gt; &gt; any input it produces. That way even the backend would be unaware of
&gt; &gt; freewheeling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. A second non-RT thread runs cycles as fast as it can, substituting
&gt; &gt; the backend buffers by dummy ones. Only two extra buffers are required
&gt; &gt; to do that, one (silenced) given to all clients that have system:capture
&gt; &gt; ports connected, and one for output (which can be shared for all system:
&gt; &gt; playback channels as it will be discarded anyway).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I always imagined things worked that way...
&gt; 
&gt; what you describe is actually more complex. it requires special
&gt; handling of port buffers, which the current scheme(s) (multiple since
&gt; both jack1 and jack2 do this) do not. it also requires a second thread
&gt; which comes and goes.  the current schemes simply tell the backend
&gt; that its freewheeling - it stops the device it is using, and simply
&gt; wakes up the "engine" immediately that the engine returns from the
&gt; previous "cycle" (rather than waiting for the device). almost no other
&gt; code is required. starting and stopping devices is something that the
&gt; backend will already have code for; the idea that such code is not
&gt; functional if called more than once seems problematic.

It looks like there's a dedicated freewheeling thread anyway...

(from engine.c)

    engine-&gt;stop_freewheeling = 1;

    VERBOSE (engine, "freewheeling stopped, waiting for thread");
    pthread_join (engine-&gt;freewheel_thread, &amp;ftstatus);
    VERBOSE (engine, "freewheel thread has returned");

    engine-&gt;fwclient = 0;
    engine-&gt;freewheeling = 0;


But that's not the point of this post. There seems to be 
a more serious problem: it looks like when freewheeling
terminates the DLL is not re-initialised correctly.

This results in the following problem: a client reading
jack_last_frame_time() and converting this to usecs
using jack_frames_to_time() gets the impression that no
time has passed while jackd was freewheeling. In other
words, until the DLL catches up correcting this error
(which takes a time roughly equal to 1/DLL_bandwidth)
the client gets a completely wrong idea of the start
time of the current period - one that continues at the
point when freewheeling was *started* rather than when
it terminated. This completely messes up clients that
need to compare this time to other event times measured
using jack's usecs timer.
