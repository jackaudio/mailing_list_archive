A re-cap:


Me: I am running ubuntu 11.10 and I broadcast to an icecast2 server 
using*I*nternet *DJ C*onsole and JACK.
I am finding that when I go to the website 
http://www.endeavoracademy.com/online-classes to check levels of the 
broadcast it freezes the browser than I have to close it.

I got a response from the IDJC maker: "IDJC uses JACK Audio Connection 
Kit which locks out standard ALSA sound sources from directly using the 
sound card. The Flash plugin may be doing the wrong thing when its audio 
is blocked like going off the rails."

Jamie wrote : If your setup relies on the ALSA JACK plugin to coerce ALSA-aware
applications to route PCM via JACK, and you are having problems with
firefox then you'll need disable JACK's memory locking as the javascript
engine's garbage collection implementation ignores the return values
from madvise which can lead to browser lockups and heavy CPU
consumption:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=660960

Me: I went herehttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=660960
  but was unable to disable the memory lock. I'm very new to linux and I think it was just me not really getting the result as opposed to it not being a possible working solution.

Did you try for recording the audio stream using
http://jackaudio.org/routing_flash  ?

I didn't record audio/video from Flash myself.

me: N.B I am not recording flash I am just trying to hear what it sounds like on the website.
I went and did the flash routing and got this from terminal

tony@bbatbigvalley:~$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/libflashsupport-jack.git

fatal: destination path 'libflashsupport-jack' already exists and is not 
an empty directory.

tony@bbatbigvalley:~$ cd libflashsupport-jack

tony@bbatbigvalley:~/libflashsupport-jack$ sh bootstrap.sh

+ [ x = xam ]

+ rm -rf autom4te.cachemake

+ rm -f config.cache

+ test x = x

+ LIBTOOLIZE=libtoolize

+ libtoolize -c --force

bootstrap.sh: 1: libtoolize: not found

tony@bbatbigvalley:~/libflashsupport-jack$ ls

bootstrap.sh  configure.ac  flashsupport.c  Makefile.am

tony@bbatbigvalley:~/libflashsupport-jack$ sudo ln -s 
/usr/local/lib/flashsupport.so /usr/lib64

[sudo] password for tony:

ln: creating symbolic link `/usr/lib64': File exists


   So at this point I really need some help, still not getting any sound 
from the website because it freezes.
Sorry this so bloody long.

Any ideas?
