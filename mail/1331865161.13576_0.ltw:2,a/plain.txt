Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack on Windoze 7

Hi! Apologies in advance if this is the wrong place for this. I recently
installed the windows executables on my W7 machine, but when I try to run
the portaudio with Asio4All, as instructed, I get an
AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics error. This duplicates on another machine as
well.
Any thoughts?
Thanks!
Tobin
