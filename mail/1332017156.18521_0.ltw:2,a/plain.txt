Hi, especially las!

I've merged Jonathan's update to support buffersize changes with FFADO.
You should have received a merge request, otherwise, pull from

He has spotted a problem, the ALSA backend doesn't report the changed

I believe we have to change this, either on higher layers (probably not
possible) or in each driver individually.
