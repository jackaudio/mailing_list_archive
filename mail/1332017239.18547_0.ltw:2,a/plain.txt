the server will not terminate any clients. the thread(s) created by
libjack will exit at some point when/if they discover that the server
is gone, but that may never happen.

the whole point of the shutdown callback is that  the client has no
way to differentiate between "the server has gone" and "the server
hasn't called me in a very, very long time.
