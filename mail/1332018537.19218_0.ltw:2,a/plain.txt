Indeed. I'm asking because I noticed that an app (in development
and not having a shutdown callback) terminates if the server is
stopped, even while it has other active threads. None of its code
watching stop conditions is ever called.  Removing the shutdown
handler in other apps (e.g. jaaa) leads to the same result. Now I'm
pretty sure that did not happen before. It looks as if Jack's thread
is calling exit() or something similar when it terminates... Have 
there been recent changes in that area ?
