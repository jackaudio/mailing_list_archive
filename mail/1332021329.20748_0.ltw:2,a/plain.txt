Hi sletz!


I've ported Jonathan's patch to jackd2.



I've also added the missing functionality that updates the port latency
after changing the buffer size.

Either pull from

    git://github.com/adiknoth/jack2.git  fixes


or visit

    https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/pull/8

to review and merge the patches.


Everything is runtime tested, confirmed to work.


Cheers
