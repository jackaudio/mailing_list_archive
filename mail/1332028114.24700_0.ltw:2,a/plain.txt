Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack2 waf upgrade and python3 support

I've merged the python3-waf-upgrade branch. Most of the work was done by
Adrian Knoth.

The upgraded waf is expcted to work on Linux. On MacOS and Solaris there
could be problems. I don't have access to a Solaris system and for
MacOS binaries, Stephane seems to use XCode instead.
