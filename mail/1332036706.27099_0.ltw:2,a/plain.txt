In-Reply-To: Dénes Almási [Jack-Devel] Profiling xruns (1332031366.26680_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Profiling xruns

this involves kernel "debugging". there are facilities in the kernel
to trace delays in RT-scheduled tasks. googling with reveal more. you
will end up with very detailed information. the process is not
particularly smooth or easy - its targetted at kernel developers and
highly technical user space developers - but it is quite powerful.
