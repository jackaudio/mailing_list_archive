What version of JACK are you using?

Does JACK output any errors?  If so, can you post them?

I don't have access to a Mac, but I did write the code for the
CoreMIDI driver for JACK 2; so, it's possible that my code is somehow
responsible for the error.  If you know a bit about the CoreMIDI API
and/or would like to take a look at the code yourself, look here:

    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/trunk/jackmp/macosx/coremidi

Perhaps you'll see something I missed.

Hmmm.  Can you try monitoring MIDI at each stage?
