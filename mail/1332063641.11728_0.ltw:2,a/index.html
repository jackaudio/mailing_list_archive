Le 18 mars 2012 &#xE0; 01:42, D&#xE9;nes Alm&#xE1;si a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I am developing a jack client that is handling different input devices
&gt; (like joysticks, touch screens, etc.) and capable of using them as
&gt; musical input devices.
&gt; 
&gt; The architecture is relatively simple: A directed acyclic graph can be
&gt; made up of different boxes, each of them performing different tasks, like
&gt; reading input, generating oscilating values, passing data to a jack midi
&gt; or audio port, etc. When the graph is modified, a non-rt thread generates
&gt; a topologic ordering of the nodes into a linked list and a pointer to the head
&gt; is passed in a ringbuffer to the process function which at its beginning examines
&gt; the content of the buffer and can store the new list. In each process
&gt; call, the list is iterated and the process function is called for each box.
&gt; The edges have buffers which are read and written by the boxes and the topologic
&gt; ordering ensures that only those edges are read in a cycle whose data are
&gt; already computed.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is: Even without having ANY nodes, thus the process function doing
&gt; practically nothing, sometimes the application does xruns. I am sure that the
&gt; source of these xruns is the application as they show up in the messages
&gt; window of qjackctl with the app's name. Also, I am running in soft mode, which
&gt; I assume, means that xruns indicating that the backend is not fast enough, are
&gt; ignored.
&gt; 
&gt; How could I locate the cause of these xruns? Is there a good practice for profiling
&gt; these problems? I think it is hard because using tools like gprof will make the
&gt; app slow and cause xruns which would never occur without the profiling itself.
&gt; 
&gt; I am using mlockall and a big memory pool, a thread pool (though currently no threads
&gt; are created when process is called), process shielding for the sound card soft irq,
&gt; jackd and the app.
&gt; 
&gt; Jack settings: Rt priority 83, Frames/Period: 128, Sample rate: 48000, Periods/Buffer: 2.
&gt; The latency is 5.33 msec and apps like ardour xrun only very rarely, under heavy usage.
&gt; The machine is a samsung notebook with a core i3 cpu, 3Gb ram and unfortunately an onboard
&gt; soundcard.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it better for xrun debugging to use the dummy interface in order to be totally
&gt; independent of the sound card? Also, could it be the problem that I am using
&gt; clutter for gui? I am quite a beginner in developing audio applications...
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you in advance,
&gt; Dennis

It you are using JACK2, then you can possibly try it's "profiling" mode. When compiled with --profile (added at configure time), JACK2 can produce different timing graph that can be the displayed with gnuplot.

Look at the paper here: http://www.grame.fr/Ressources/pub/Timing.pdf
