Sorry, I thought it is a well-known form of profiling. This
method was earlier suggested for me by Stéphane Letz.

I compiled jack with --profile, it is a diagram generated by the
server itself. Then I used the autogenerated generate_timings
script to plot the diagrams. This one is explained in
http://www.grame.fr/Ressources/pub/Timing.pdf , section 2.3.

I was asking this because it is difficult to understand these
results at first glance even with the explanations in the paper.

Measuring was done by executing,
$ jackd -P83 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r48000 -p64 -n3 -Xraw
then started my app, waited for some xruns to happen
and closed everything. When the server closed, it generated
this profiling output among others.

I just want to understand this whole architecture in order
to be able to create efficient realtime applications.

Thanks,
Dennis
