I did new tests in both synchronous and asynchronous modes.
I uploaded all the results:

   [Asynchonous]
Audio driver timing:

Clients duration:

Clients end date:

Driver end date:

Scheduling latency:

   [Synchronous]
Audio driver timing:
http://denes.rudanium.org/shots/perform-3S-audiodrivertiming.png

Clients duration:
http://denes.rudanium.org/shots/perform-3S-clientsduration.png

Clients end date:

Driver end date:
http://denes.rudanium.org/shots/perform-3S-driverenddate.png

Scheduling latency:

In synchrnous mode, it works nicely without xruns. But the audio
driver timing looks really ugly and that can't be good in general.
It is an onboard soundcard, I don't expect wonders to happen but
if you have any hints on improving the situation, I would be very
glad to hear them.

Also, there is an interesting spike at around the 20000th cycle
in asynchrnous clients duration and scheduling latency. A possible
cause is my automatic process shielding script which checks running
processes every 20 seconds for my client and puts it on two exclusive
cores with jack. I could imagine that this "switch" can cause a spike
in scheduling.

Thank you for your help,
Dennis
