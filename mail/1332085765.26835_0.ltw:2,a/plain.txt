Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Interpreting 'Clients end date' gnuplot diagram

The audio card interrupt is not regular, so in this case the "synchronous" mode is mandatory.

Then this spike in scheduling timing is rather odd. What is is "shielding script which checks running, processes every 20 seconds for my client and puts it on two exclusive, cores with jack."? Why in the first place?

Client duration spike here (http://denes.rudanium.org/shots/perform-2-clientsduration.png) at 20000 is also strange. Any explanation in your audio process for that?
