Thanks Devin

&gt;
&gt; What version of JACK are you using?
&gt;
&gt;
I'm using Jack Pilot installed from the Jack OS X dmg file:

JackOSX 0.89
  - Jackdmp 1.9.8
  - JackRouter 0.9.5
  - JackPilot 1.7.3

I've tried with and without hog mode.


&gt; Does JACK output any errors?  If so, can you post them?
&gt;
&gt;
I tried again with jack set to do verbose logging. There are no messages
printed at the time of a dropped note.


&gt; I don't have access to a Mac, but I did write the code for the
&gt; CoreMIDI driver for JACK 2; so, it's possible that my code is somehow
&gt; responsible for the error.  If you know a bit about the CoreMIDI API
&gt; and/or would like to take a look at the code yourself, look here:
&gt;
&gt;    http://trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/trunk/jackmp/macosx/coremidi
&gt;
&gt;
I'd be totally unqualified to do that unfortunately. Is this the place for
Jack OS X bug reports? I tried use the link to the Yahoo group from the
Jack OSX site but it didn't work for me. ( Got stuck in an endless loop of
Yahoo balogna, it's a wonder their still in business! )


&gt; &gt; Using jack pilot, I have my app routed to the IAC loopback driver on os
&gt; x,
&gt; &gt; and I have a vst synth (Zebra2) playing on a channel in Reaper. I also
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; a midi monitor open spying on the output. The dropped messages are
&gt; printed
&gt; &gt; in my app, and then don't show up in the midi monitor. So I guess either:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - they aren't really going out from my app
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - or are they aren't really getting through the IAC driver.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - or something else I can't fathom.
&gt;
&gt;
Hmmm.  Can you try monitoring MIDI at each stage?
&gt;
&gt;
How would I do that? The only midi monitor I have going is the one from
here:
http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/

It doesn't detect any thing getting to the IAC bus. Are there other ways to
monitor whether something is going out from my app? I saw Paul's post about
jack_midi_dump and will have to dig into that later, but wanted to get a
reply out.

Thanks
Iain
