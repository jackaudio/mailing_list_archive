Thanks Devin

I'm using Jack Pilot installed from the Jack OS X dmg file:

JackOSX 0.89
  - Jackdmp 1.9.8
  - JackRouter 0.9.5
  - JackPilot 1.7.3

I've tried with and without hog mode.

I tried again with jack set to do verbose logging. There are no messages
printed at the time of a dropped note.

I'd be totally unqualified to do that unfortunately. Is this the place for
Jack OS X bug reports? I tried use the link to the Yahoo group from the
Jack OSX site but it didn't work for me. ( Got stuck in an endless loop of
Yahoo balogna, it's a wonder their still in business! )

Hmmm.  Can you try monitoring MIDI at each stage?

How would I do that? The only midi monitor I have going is the one from
here:
http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/

It doesn't detect any thing getting to the IAC bus. Are there other ways to
monitor whether something is going out from my app? I saw Paul's post about
jack_midi_dump and will have to dig into that later, but wanted to get a
reply out.

Thanks
Iain
