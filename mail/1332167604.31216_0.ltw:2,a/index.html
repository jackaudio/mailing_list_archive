&gt;&gt; I'm wondering how your code could replace the "adapter" mechanism that I did in JACK2 for that never worked fully reliably. Basically the "adapter" idea is a bit more general in the sense that it aims at "adapting" streams in different context: like network &lt;==&gt; Audio API (CoreAudio for OSX, ALSA for Linux, PortAudio for Windows...), or several ALSA devices..etc.. 
&gt;&gt; (The adapters are also developed as "in server" clients, this make a bit more easy to add them in a running session using "ladish" kind of studio management approaches...)
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; How complex do you think it would be?
&gt; 
&gt; I'd never consider writing a2j and j2a as 'in-server' clients, they are far
&gt; too complex for that. An 'in-server' client should be so simple that there is 
&gt; essentially no risk that it could ever malfunction and take the entire server
&gt; down. As as long as it does simple audio processing that can probably be the
&gt; case (but even that isn't given - consider an app sending Nans and Infs to
&gt; an internal client).
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from Jack's thread, a2j and j2a have two other threads. One runs at
&gt; a higher priority than Jack (reading and writing the ALSA device), the
&gt; second is the 'main event loop', ATM only providing text output to the user,
&gt; but I'm considering GUI versions as well. There is also some non-trivial
&gt; state management involving messages between these threads - required mainly
&gt; to recover cleanly from anything that disrupts regular period timing, xruns,
&gt; skipped cycles, freewheeling, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; So the idea of making these 'in-server' was rejected quite early, also
&gt; because really nothing is gained by it.

Well I think it does in some cases, and basically when controlled by the so called "Control API" 

&gt; 
&gt; Also, apps like these are 'fixed infrastructure', not something managed
&gt; on project/session level. In my 'ideal world' they would run as system
&gt; daemons, as would Jack itself.
&gt; 
&gt; What would be an interesting addition to Jack would be the possibility
&gt; to reduce the timing uncertainty for certain clients. At the moment
&gt; a client can run anywhere between the start of a cycle and the start
&gt; of the next one - no assumptions can be made. If a2j would always
&gt; run near the start of a cycle, and j2a never before e.g. 90% of the
&gt; cycle has passed, that would enable to reduce the minimum required
&gt; latency.

Do you mean having the sever "decide" to run a2j/j2a before others in a given cycle?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Network versions (j2n and n2j) are in development. They are meant for
&gt; use on a LAN (not for the Internet at large). They use multicasting,
&gt; so you can e.g. distribute an audio signal to all machines in a lab
&gt; or classroom. Resampling is done by the receiver(s). I'll be doing a
&gt; real-life test in a few weeks, recording a concert in the CdS auditorium.
&gt; Eight mic signals will be sent by j2n connected to the nearest network
&gt; rack, from there using optical links to another network rack, and from
&gt; there to n2j running in the LABEL studio. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ciao,
&gt; 
Well so now we are on the road for "another" netjack like application...;

I'll still interested to see if your code can be used for the adapters, since it makes sense on others platforms than Linux.
