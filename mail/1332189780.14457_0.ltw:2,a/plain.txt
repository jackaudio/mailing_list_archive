Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK development repository has moved

I've been waiting to announce this for a while, hoping that we would
get the merge of the headers, example clients and utilities between
Jack1 and Jack2 complete first. That is turning out to be a slow
process, so it seems better to make it clear that things have changed.

JACK is now officially using git @ github as our development
repository. The SVN repository at jackaudio.org is no longer being
used for commits, though there are no plans to take it down at this
point (this will happen eventually).

Checking out JACK 1 and JACK 2 is very slightly different because
JACK1 is already using the "submodule" structure that we plan for
JACK2 ASAP (this is how the two projects will share various files).

* To check out a copy of JACK1

   git clone [hidden]:jackaudio/jack1.git
   cd jack1
   git submodule init
   git submodule update

* To check out a copy of JACK2

   [hidden]:jackaudio/jack2.git


People with write-access to the old JACK SVN repository will need to
get themselves registered at github and then notify Adrian Knoth
([hidden]) to gain similar access to the git repo.
The process for checking out a push-able git repo for something with
submodules has a couple of extra steps which we'll go over with you
when you ask.

The website will be updated within the next few hours.
