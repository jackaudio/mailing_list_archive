Did you include this one as well: (not included in the patches)

There is one more fix needed in engine.c : when the buffer
size is modified, engine->first_wakeup should be set. This
will re-init period_usecs (which will otherwise take a long
time to catch up), and also reset the filter coefficient for
the correct DLL bandwidth.
