I didn't remove 'reset_pending' because I wasn't sure if 
'first_wakeup' could be used from the context that sets
'reset_pending'. The 'pending' part suggested something
asynchronous, i.e. this flag implicitly being used as a
sema in combination with some mutexes.

Apart from that there could be just one flag.

But you really want the 'perfect' way, there could be more.
There are 3 things to initialise:

1. next_wakeup (to the current wakeup time, as the DLL will run)
2. period_usecs
3. filter_omega

'First cycle' and 'buffer size change' should set them all.
For 'xrun' and 'end of freewheeling', just setting (1) is
enough, as the current value of (2) would be more accurate
than the initial one, and (3) is a constant.

There are two other matters to consider/check.

For the first, see the comments near the end of jack_run_cycle();

The second concerns Jack1 only IIRC. If a cycle is skipped, 
the DLL should be run anyway. Jack1-0.121.3 did the right
thing and I don't think the patches affect this. But it's
worth checking.

Ciao.
