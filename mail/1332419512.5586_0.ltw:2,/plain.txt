OK, but the thing is that  'end of freewheeling' event happens outside of the audio RT thread. 

Right now JACK2 "set them all" in case of  : 'First cycle', 'buffer size change', and  'end of freewheeling' (since actually the audio driver is restarted and get back in the "First cycle'" case).

In JACK2,  Xrun case can be possibly do " just setting (1)". I'll change that.

Ok for JACK1, JACK2 does that for "each callback" (real one or emulated one  with a thread + blocking backend)

OK for JACK1 possibly, JACK2 does not have this issue.
