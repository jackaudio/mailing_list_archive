Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Mixing midi streams

Hi!

I would like to ask, what is the convenient way for mixing two midi 
streams?
Or more generally, what is the way mixing two streams where trivial 
methods
like adding the two signals don't work? (I will have to do this not 
only with
midi but some other custom protocols.)

My best guess would be having the streams in a fixed order and for each 
period
the first stream would be simply copied to an output buffer while for 
any
additional streams if a current position is already occupied in the 
output, the
closest empty places 'in the future' would be filled with the new data. 
But this
seems to be a bit harsh...

Thanks,
Dennis
