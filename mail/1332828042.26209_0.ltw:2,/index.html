Hi guys! I've been a fan of Jack for a while now (on my Linux boxes where
everything works GREAT). Joined the devel list because I'm having some
issues getting everything going on my Windows box.

In particular I'm trying to get my Torq to allow vinyl control while linked
with Ableton Live and using my Xone:4D mixer as the mixer &amp; soundcard. To
do this, it appears I have to have Jack as the bridge in between.

The problem I'm having is the installer that I downloaded from the site
says "The file is corrupted. It was downloaded with errors or is otherwise
damaged." This happens for both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions of the
installer that I download.

Being a software developer myself, I thought I'd give it a shot and try to
build it myself. :) Unfortunately my skills are limited to linux systems
and building code in Windows is a daunting task.

I've gone through the README files in the windows directory, grabbed
Code::Blocks &amp; MingW, and a few other things -- but I was unable to find
the SJLJ on the MingW site. I did find mentions that it was no longer
available because the latest version supports everything it did. ???

Anyway, in Code::Blocks, I get this error when I try to build anything ...

"jackd - Win32 Release 64bits" uses an invalid compiler. Probably the
toolchain path within the compiler options is not setup correctly?!
Skipping...

I tried a 32 bit build and got the same notice.At this point, I don't know
what to do next. :-/ I'm sorry for being such a noob at this, but I swear
its a windows vs linux thing. If I can get a little help, I would
appreciate it SOOOO much!

Of course a working setup.exe would be even better but then I would be
asking for a new one every time... kinda like the teach a man to fish
concept.

I've tried older versions of the jack library but they caused Torq to crash
every time without fail, so I'm hoping the newer version will work better.
Rumor has it this is the way to do it... crossing my fingers!

Thanks again for all you do!
