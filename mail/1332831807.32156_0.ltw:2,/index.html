Le 27 mars 2012 &#xE0; 08:00, Professor PsyPhi a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Hi guys! I've been a fan of Jack for a while now (on my Linux boxes where everything works GREAT). Joined the devel list because I'm having some issues getting everything going on my Windows box.
&gt; 
&gt; In particular I'm trying to get my Torq to allow vinyl control while linked with Ableton Live and using my Xone:4D mixer as the mixer &amp; soundcard. To do this, it appears I have to have Jack as the bridge in between.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem I'm having is the installer that I downloaded from the site says "The file is corrupted. It was downloaded with errors or is otherwise damaged." This happens for both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions of the installer that I download.
&gt; 
&gt; Being a software developer myself, I thought I'd give it a shot and try to build it myself. :) Unfortunately my skills are limited to linux systems and building code in Windows is a daunting task.
&gt; 
&gt; I've gone through the README files in the windows directory, grabbed Code::Blocks &amp; MingW, and a few other things -- but I was unable to find the SJLJ on the MingW site. I did find mentions that it was no longer available because the latest version supports everything it did. ???
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, in Code::Blocks, I get this error when I try to build anything ...
&gt; 
&gt; "jackd - Win32 Release 64bits" uses an invalid compiler. Probably the toolchain path within the compiler options is not setup correctly?! Skipping...
&gt; 
&gt; I tried a 32 bit build and got the same notice.At this point, I don't know what to do next. :-/ I'm sorry for being such a noob at this, but I swear its a windows vs linux thing. If I can get a little help, I would appreciate it SOOOO much!
&gt; 
&gt; Of course a working setup.exe would be even better but then I would be asking for a new one every time... kinda like the teach a man to fish concept.
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried older versions of the jack library but they caused Torq to crash every time without fail, so I'm hoping the newer version will work better. Rumor has it this is the way to do it... crossing my fingers!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for all you do!
&gt;

1) What versions of the installer have you used?

2) Can you try those one here: 

Official 1.9.8:

Pure 32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_32_setup.exe

Mixed 64/32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.8_64_setup.exe

Or beta 1.9.9:

Pure 32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.9_32_setup.exe

Mixed 64/32 bits version: http://www.grame.fr/~letz/Jack_v1.9.9_64_setup.exe
