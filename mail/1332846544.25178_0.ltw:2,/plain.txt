Subject:     [Jack-Devel] unable to install

Hello,
I have reinstalled my notebook yesterday and now i want to reinstall jackaudio as well. Only problem is i can'topen the installation files, it keeps telling me this: 

''The file is corrupted. It was downloaded with errors or otherwise damaged. Please download it again and make sure you do not have viruses.'' I have tried several browsers to download the file as well as turning windows firewall on/off. What could be the problem?Many thanks,Rutger van der Vliet
