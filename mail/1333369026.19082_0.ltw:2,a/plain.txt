Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Float clipping

Hello,

It may have been asked a few time I guess but mailing list archives do not seem accessible to me right now.
I see a few algorithm working on unsigned int datatype and doing some clipping (ie maxing to unsigned int max value or the inverse).
How could I do that to those little nice 32bits FP Jack samples ?

Regards
