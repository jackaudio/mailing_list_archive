Subject:     [LAD] [ANN] JAudioLibs v1.0.120123 (JNAJack Java<>JACK improvements)

Hi All,

JAudioLibs v1.0.120123 is now available from
http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils

There's only one major change in this release - the addition of
JNAJack support for JNA's new CallbackThreadInitializer, which was
specifically requested for JNAJack, and brings a big improvement in
CPU usage.

Use of JNA 3.4.0+ is now highly recommended, and JNAJack will emit a
warning if an earlier version of JNA is detected (though it will still
work).

There are no API changes.

Full release notes are available at
http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/wiki/ReleaseNotes

As you may have guessed from the version number, this is actually the
code from the January release of Praxis
(http://code.google.com/p/praxis/).  The delay in releasing separately
was caused by a) the desire to test and b) a manic couple of months!
;-)

Best wishes,

Neil
