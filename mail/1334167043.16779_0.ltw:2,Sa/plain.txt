Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Linux Audio Conference 2012 at CCRMA - live stream coverage starting tomorrow

Hi *!


On behalf of the conference organizers, we would like to invite you to 
join the Linux Audio Conference 2012, kindly hosted by the Center for 
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University.

The conference will start tomorrow, Thursday April 12, at 10:00 PST 
(that's UTC - 0700). Please refer to the schedule at

    http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2012/program

for detailed information.

We will be streaming all paper presentations live in Ogg Theora/Ogg 
Vorbis format. Users of the Firefox browser should be able to watch this 
natively without any plugins. For users of other browsers, we recommend 
VLC, a cross-platform media player which you can download from 
http://videolan.org.

You are invited to join us on IRC while you're watching the streams, the 
conference channel is #lac2012 on freenode.net, to be accessed with the 
chat client of your choice, or via 
http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lac2012
Remote participants can post their questions or remarks on this channel, 
and a local chat operator here in Stanford will then relay them to the 
presenters and the local audience. You can also use this channel to get 
help in case of viewing problems.

All presentations will be recorded and uploaded for off-line watching 
within a day or so.

Needless to say, access to all streams is free of charge. This is all 
about open source after all :)

The primary stream relay is available at

    http://ccrma.stanford.edu:8080 (located on the west coast of the US).

A secondary relay which is preferrable for European users is at

    http://streamer.stackingdwarves.net (located in Germany).


Best regards,


the LAC stream team.
