Maybe I suggested the division in the incorrect location.
I tried the equivalent in Octave, and it seems to work with:
cos(n/Fs*2*pi*freq)

I don't remember how operator order of precedence works in Octave, so I
also tried:
cos(2*pi*n*(freq/sample_rate))

and that also seemed to work like expected.

By work as expected, I just mean it generated cosine values of the
expected period.  I did not try to actually implement a variable delay so
that I could make a flanger in Octave code.

Are you doing any prototype code in Octave, or is everything in C?

Also, I didn't really pay attention to how you were implementing the
delay.  I had assumed you would do an interpolated delay so you can make
smooth phase adjustments.  If you are just grabbing samples from the delay
buffer, you are going to have discontinuous jumps between samples, and
that is going to sound really bad, just like having lots of under-runs
(same effect, you are just skipping over some samples and not playing
them).
