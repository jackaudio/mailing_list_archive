&gt;&gt; Thanks, I did try that, but when I do, the sine does not seem to evolve.

&gt; Maybe I suggested the division in the incorrect location.
&gt; I tried the equivalent in Octave, and it seems to work with:
&gt; cos(n/Fs*2*pi*freq)
&gt;
&gt; I don't remember how operator order of precedence works in Octave, so I
&gt; also tried:
&gt; cos(2*pi*n*(freq/sample_rate))
&gt;
&gt; and that also seemed to work like expected.
&gt;
&gt; By work as expected, I just mean it generated cosine values of the
&gt; expected period.  I did not try to actually implement a variable delay so
&gt; that I could make a flanger in Octave code.
&gt;

If you are looking for a flanger implemented in Matlab (most probably 
works with litte or no changes also in Octave) you may take a look at e.g.
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6656-flange-effect

or this nice presentation containing flanger Matlab code as well:

http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/CM0268/PDF/10_CM0268_Audio_FX.pdf

or in general:

http://www.google.com/search?q=flanger+octave+OR+matlab

&gt; Are you doing any prototype code in Octave, or is everything in C?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I didn't really pay attention to how you were implementing the
&gt; delay.  I had assumed you would do an interpolated delay so you can make
&gt; smooth phase adjustments.  If you are just grabbing samples from the delay
&gt; buffer, you are going to have discontinuous jumps between samples, and
&gt; that is going to sound really bad, just like having lots of under-runs
&gt; (same effect, you are just skipping over some samples and not playing
&gt; them).
