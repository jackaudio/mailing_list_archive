Hi.

I don't know if this is the correct place to send this e-mail, but I am unable to get Jack to run on my system.  My operating system is Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium and it is on a HP PC.  I have tried everything through your web site to get it to run, I even downloaded and tried to compile the source from this web site: http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/ and it would not compile; but I am not sure how to compile anything with Nokia QT SDK.  This is what Jack Control is telling me in the Crash Report it is producing:

07:45:17.541 Patchbay deactivated.
07:45:17.557 Statistics reset.
07:45:17.619 Startup script...
07:45:17.619 artsshell -q terminate
07:45:18.134 Startup script terminated with exit status=1.
07:45:18.134 JACK is starting...
07:45:18.134 jackd.exe -S -R -dportaudio -r48000 -p1024
07:45:18.196 JACK was started with PID=7760432.
07:45:18.430 JACK was stopped with exit status=-1.
07:45:18.430 Post-shutdown script...
07:45:18.430 killall jackd
07:45:18.430 JACK has crashed.
07:45:18.914 Post-shutdown script terminated with exit status=1.
07:45:20.458 Could not connect to JACK server as client. - Overall operation failed. - Unable to connect to server. Please check the messages window for more info.

Is there a solution to the problem or can't I use Jack Audio on my system?  Presently, I still have it installed on my computer waiting for a response to this e-mail.  I am trying to make Fl Studio, Ableton Live, Audacity, and LMMS to work through ASIO Software to interact with Blender.

Would you send me an e-mail with information on this bug?  Thank you.
