@Ivana

it sounds like you are describing something like this;

http://syphon.v002.info/
http://code.google.com/p/syphon-framework/

I don't see how jack would have anything (directly) to do with
visualizing midi-data though or turning graphical data into audio.
That would be in the realm of environments like PD, max/msp, Iannix,
processing, Csound(AV), etc. (if they shared the jack and/or
hypothetical video backend).

But even in the case of Syphon (or jack), it is the applications that
are transforming the streams (be they audio or video), not the
sound/video server. ~ so i don't really see you logic there.
