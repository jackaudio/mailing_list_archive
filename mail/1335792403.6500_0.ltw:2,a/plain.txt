Subject:     [Jack-Devel] incompatible version of ffado error message

Hi All, 

I've been using jack with ffado as the driver for a few years now.
Today, after upgrading ffado to the latest svn , (then tested working).
I then upgraded to the latest jack svn version. Following this I started
receiving the following incompatible error message. 

JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 70
firewire ERR: Incompatible libffado version! (libffado 2.999.0-2131)
Cannot initialize driver
JackServer::Open failed with -1
no message buffer overruns
Failed to open server

As ffado doesn't seem to put out much by way of releases but is in
continuing development (last release june 2010), many of the newer
devices are only available by using the svn versions. (and some distros
don't package them in stages). This could cause issues for many users
that don't have the option of rolling back to the last stable release. 

Is there some way of loosening this rule? 

Regards

Allan
