Follow-Up:   St√©phane Letz Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows: Problem running Jack Server and Clients with DLLs (1335811574.3569_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Windows: Problem running Jack Server and Clients with DLLs

I have two DLLs. 

1) which uses the JACK Control API to setup and start the JACK server
and make / break connections

2) an implementation of a JACK Client that does some processing 

When I use the DLL's from a launcher application, everything seems to
work fine until I make connections...(i.e. when I call jack_activate()
from my Server DLL to activate a client I created to make connections)

JACK server DLL spawns a thread that sets up the server, creates, and
starts it. Then spins on jackctl_wait_signals(signal)

The Client DLL registers itself with the server, registers the process
callback, defines ports, activates etc...

At that point things work as expected.  The client callback is being
called by the Jack Server and it all looks good. 

Now...In order to make connections, My Jack Server DLL creates a client
called "jack_connnect" and when jack_activate(client) is called things
start going wrong.  The DSP load jumps to 75% and the process callback
in the client starts getting skipped. I discovered that if ANY other
client calls jack_activate() this happens.

I can also recreate the problem by using the JackControl application.
If I get everything working again and instead of trying to make
connections myself, I launch JackControl (qjackctl.exe), the same
problem happens.

Finally,

If I run my client as a separate executable instead of using the DLL
from the launcher process, things work fine.

I am having trouble understanding what the difference is.  Since the
Jack server spawns threads and those threads are executing the
processing callback, I am not sure why implementing the client in a DLL
is an issue.  Clearly, there is something I am missing... Any help would
be greatly appreciated.

I using JACK 1.9.9_32

Thanks,

Chris

Hi Hunter,

Please don't top-post on this mailing list. Thanks.
I took the liberty to re-arrange this message. More at the bottom.

An alternative solution was posted ~3 weeks ago on this list:
