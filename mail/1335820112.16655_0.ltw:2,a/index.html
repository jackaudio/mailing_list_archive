I Don't think what I am doing is an "In Server" client.

Attached is a test program where I just threw all the parts of the process into a console app.
With this test program, the problem is still there.  

I create the server. Then I create a client and register its ports and process callback with the server. I sleep for 5 seconds so you can see the process callback happening.

Then I try to create another client by another name for the purpose of making connections.  After I call jack_client_open()...the problems arise  

Because my process callback is printing "." this is what I see:

.................................................JackWinSemaphore::TimedWait name = jack_pipe.default_freewheel time_out
JackFreewheelDriver::ProcessSync SuspendRefNum error
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphSync: ProcessWriteSlaves error, engine may now behave abnormally!!

And that repeats indefinitely but since the callback isn't being called anymore, no more periods.

Also, if I create the server and make connections this way, but run my client as a separate process, things work just fine.  


Thanks,

Chris

Le 30 avr. 2012 &#xE0; 19:24, Sprague, Christopher M CIV NAVAIR, Code 4.6.2.3 a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; I have two DLLs. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) which uses the JACK Control API to setup and start the JACK server
&gt; and make / break connections
&gt; 
&gt; 2) an implementation of a JACK Client that does some processing 
&gt; 
&gt; When I use the DLL's from a launcher application, everything seems to
&gt; work fine until I make connections...(i.e. when I call jack_activate()
&gt; from my Server DLL to activate a client I created to make connections)
&gt; 
&gt; JACK server DLL spawns a thread that sets up the server, creates, and
&gt; starts it. Then spins on jackctl_wait_signals(signal)
&gt; 
&gt; The Client DLL registers itself with the server, registers the process
&gt; callback, defines ports, activates etc...
&gt; 
&gt; At that point things work as expected.  The client callback is being
&gt; called by the Jack Server and it all looks good. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now...In order to make connections, My Jack Server DLL creates a client
&gt; called "jack_connnect" and when jack_activate(client) is called things
&gt; start going wrong.  The DSP load jumps to 75% and the process callback
&gt; in the client starts getting skipped. I discovered that if ANY other
&gt; client calls jack_activate() this happens.

So you basically create a "in server" client right?

Described behaviour looks like a thread priority issue..

Do you have any test code that shows the problem that you could share?

Thanks.
