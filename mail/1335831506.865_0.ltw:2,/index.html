We're hoping to rectify that soon, now that some of us actually have some
time again.

&gt; ... many of the newer devices are only available by using the svn
&gt; versions. (and some distros don't package them in stages). This could
&gt; cause issues for many users that don't have the option of rolling back to
&gt; the last stable release.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there some way of loosening this rule? 

The rule as it stands in the current git repo really needs to stand for
technical reasons.  However, it is now (as of a month or so ago) somewhat
more forgiving than it used to be.  From here on in, jackd should be much
more flexible as to which versions of libffado it is willing to work with,
which provides a cleaner avenue for future FFADO API updates.

Older versions of jackd are, however, still very picky about what libffado
version they are willing to tolerate.  Obviously we can't retrospectively
fix this so we've just got to accept it.  This is why current libffado
determines whether an old intolerant version of jackd is on the system and
adjusts itself so as to make that jackd version happy.  This, plus the more
flexible approach now taken by jackd, means that users *should* have the
option to upgrade either jackd, FFADO and still have a working system.

This is why I'm puzzled as to why your process broke things.  While the
order you did things in would have resulted in a libffado that was
compatible with the old jackd (since that's the version of jackd that was on
the system when you compiled FFADO), there's no obvious reason why the newer
jackd should choke on this.  Newer jack should work with a libffado which
exports the older API - unless, as I mentioned, your "new" jackd was from
the now disused svn repository.

If you could clarify where you obtained your jackd source from it would be
appreciated.  If it was from git then things should have worked, and I'd
like to determine why they didn't.
