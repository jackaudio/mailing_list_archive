&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been using jack with ffado as the driver for a few years now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today, after upgrading ffado to the latest svn , (then tested working).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I then upgraded to the latest jack svn version. Following this I started
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receiving the following incompatible error message. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You were doing it in the wrong order.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; FFADO detects the jackd version at compile time. If it's a new jackd
&gt; &gt; &gt; version supporting the new API, it switches to the new API.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Similarly, if there is no jackd installed at compile time ffado assumes that
&gt; &gt; the jackd which will ultimately be available will support the new API.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So in Allan's case, he compiled a new FFADO against an old jack, which
&gt; &gt; resulted in a FFADO which uses the old API.  The old jack was happy with
&gt; &gt; this and everything worked.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I tried this in a few different ways in the end .. Same result. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You've just told FFADO to adjust itself to an old jackd version.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Simply compile FFADO again.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yep, that should work.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, from a development point of view I'm a little surprised that the
&gt; &gt; latest jackd didn't simply accept FFADO as it was.  The relevant line in
&gt; &gt; current jack1 is drivers/firewire/ffado_driver.c, line 786 and following.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   if(ffado_get_api_version() &lt; FIREWIRE_REQUIRED_FFADO_API_VERSION) {
&gt; &gt;     printError("Incompatible libffado version! ...
&gt; &gt;   }
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The same conditional is used in jack2, so the following analysis applies
&gt; &gt; equally to that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In Allen's case, ffado_get_api_version() would return 8 (the old version).
&gt; &gt; FIREWIRE_REQUIRED_FFADO_API_VERSION is defined as 8, so this conditional
&gt; &gt; *should* have failed and the "Incompatible libffado version" message should
&gt; &gt; never have been displayed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Oh hang on: Allan, you said "the latest jack svn version".  Did you
&gt; &gt; literally use jack's subversion repository?  That is no longer carrying the
&gt; &gt; latest jackd source as far as I know: if you want the latest jackd you need
&gt; &gt; to get it using git.  This is described at
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   http://jackaudio.org/download
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, jackd was built from the "live" ebuild in the gentoo pro-audio
&gt; repository, I would have to look at the ebuild for that to determine if
&gt; it was taking the older svn version or the git version. 
&gt; 
&gt; 

and there lies the problem ..

DESCRIPTION="Jackdmp jack implemention for multi-processor machine"
HOMEPAGE="http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jackdmp.html"

ESVN_REPO_URI="http://subversion.jackaudio.org/jack/jack2/trunk/jackmp"

LICENSE="GPL-2"
SLOT="0"
KEYWORDS=""

 

it's using SVN.. I will report this back to the gentoo pro-audio list 


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Look for the "JACK Source Code Repository" section about half-way down.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't know the state of jack's ffado driver in the old svn repository, but
&gt; &gt; the use of the older jack code (which could be in an unstable intermediate
&gt; &gt; state with respect to ffado driver updates) may explain the symptoms
&gt; &gt; described.
