Dear Paul,
I run the Asterisk test again.
It show the same error message, but the jackd version is changed to 0.122.0.
Then, I do the "ps aux" ... but just find that nothing was executed about
jackd ...

... So, I will take my effort to find out what asterisk do?

Best Regart, Andre

Dear Paul,
I deal the version problem at first.

originally, I installed jack1 by ubuntu Synaptic Packet Manager (choose
jackd).
And version 0.118 seems to be the newest version, even through I use apt-get
to upgrade.

So I try to download the source code and build it. As following:
git clone git://github.com/jackaudio/jack1.git
cd jack1
git submodule init
git submodule update
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

... But I wonder if the installation successfully? since I still see the
version 0.118 in the ubuntu Synaptic Packet Manager.

... (skip)...
