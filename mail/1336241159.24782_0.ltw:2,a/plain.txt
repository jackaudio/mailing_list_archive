Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Split template files

Hi!

I'm by far no C++ expert and only have a rough idea how templates work,
but to the best of my knowledge, it is not permitted to have a template
prototype declaration in a header file and the actual implementation in
a corresponding cpp file without special magic.

It took me a couple of hours to debug

    https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/issues/4

because I was misled by the idea that the recent change in the build
system might have caused the problem.

In the end, objdump and strings have confirmed that the code in question
was never compiled. This is exactly what articles on the web say[0][1].

Of course, there is the export keyword, but iirc, it's deprecated in
C++11.

So I moved the code back in commit

 
<https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/dfbd8ce733a12d381522b66fe0228d970d32e7c1>,


effectively fixing the runtime error.



Cheers
