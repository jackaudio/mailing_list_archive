I'm cross posting, including this to the JACK mailing list.

&gt; Hey guys..  I recently acquired a RME Raydat interface (works like a
&gt; *charm*, and I love it!), but ever since I installed it, I'm getting a
&gt; random error when I try to export my tracks, and it's driving me bonkers.
&gt;
&gt; Previously to installing the Raydat card, I had used ardour for
&gt; approximately 10 years, and have never experienced this problem.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is about 75% of the time, when exporting, the GUI will just
&gt; sit there and do nothing, maintaining the "export" button depressed
&gt; continually.   Within QJackctl's "message" window, I see the following
&gt; error:
&gt;
&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = ardour was not run: state = 2
&gt;
&gt; JackFreewheelDriver::Process: Process error
&gt;
&gt; 00:31:20.920 XRUN callback (1).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The remaining 25% of the time it exports just fine, without issue.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating.  Googling the problem
&gt; returns nothing but the snippet of code which contains the error message
&gt; itself, which can be found at the link below:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; http://www.trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/branches/pipelining/common/JackFreewheelDriver.cpp?rev=4306
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.  If more info is needed, please let
&gt; me know what I can get you.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Also, thanks to everyone who assured me that the Raydat card works well
&gt; under Linux.  It really does work like a charm.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards,

I've since found that this problem only occurs in Jack2.  Jack1 exports
100% of the time just fine, but I've found that Jack2 (aside from the
export problem) works much better under high stress.  Most of my projects
contain a high number of tracks / plugins / etc... Thus, high stress.  It'd
be very nice to go back to Jack2, but not being able to export pretty much
kills any usefulness from it.  Any ideas at all?

Thanks in advance.
