I'm cross posting, including this to the JACK mailing list.

I've since found that this problem only occurs in Jack2.  Jack1 exports
100% of the time just fine, but I've found that Jack2 (aside from the
export problem) works much better under high stress.  Most of my projects
contain a high number of tracks / plugins / etc... Thus, high stress.  It'd
be very nice to go back to Jack2, but not being able to export pretty much
kills any usefulness from it.  Any ideas at all?

Thanks in advance.
