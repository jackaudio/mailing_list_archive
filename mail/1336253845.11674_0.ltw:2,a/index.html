I've been doing this for 10 years.  I've successfully run the M-audio delta
1010LT, the delta 1010, the Echo Audiofire12, and now the Raydat.  The only
card which has ever exhibited this behavior is the Raydat, so there is a
high likelihood it is the Raydat's issue.  The drivers which were written
for this card are brand-new as of alsa 1.0.25, if I remember correctly.
 Perhaps I should notify the author (Adrian Knoth) of the driver...

As for now, I'm making due with Jack2, recording the "export" on to a
stereo track, and then exporting the track itself.  Seems to work, albeit a
bit more slowly...

Thanks again for the attention..  Hopefully we figure this out, because the
Raydat is an amazing card, and works very well with Linux OOTB.

&gt; Could it be that the RME Raydat interface does not "restart" correctly
&gt; when the freewheel (export) mode is finished?
&gt;
&gt; Can you possibly test with another audio card? Or even with the "dummy"
&gt; driver?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you possibly get a larger error log?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually, there is no error to be found anywhere, but in the jack
&gt; messages, and those are the only ones.  Neither jack nor mixbus stop
&gt; working when this error manifests itself.  It just sits with the export
&gt; dialog window open forever.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems like mixbus is simply waiting for some sort of response from
&gt; jack.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Perhaps there's a way to get more verbose logs?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your response, and patience, Stephane.
