Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Very frustrating problem with JACK and exporting through mixbus

I've been doing this for 10 years.  I've successfully run the M-audio delta
1010LT, the delta 1010, the Echo Audiofire12, and now the Raydat.  The only
card which has ever exhibited this behavior is the Raydat, so there is a
high likelihood it is the Raydat's issue.  The drivers which were written
for this card are brand-new as of alsa 1.0.25, if I remember correctly.
 Perhaps I should notify the author (Adrian Knoth) of the driver...

As for now, I'm making due with Jack2, recording the "export" on to a
stereo track, and then exporting the track itself.  Seems to work, albeit a
bit more slowly...

Thanks again for the attention..  Hopefully we figure this out, because the
Raydat is an amazing card, and works very well with Linux OOTB.
