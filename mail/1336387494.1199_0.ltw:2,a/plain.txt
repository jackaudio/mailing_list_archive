OTOH, it just works with jackd1. Weird.

I'm running jackd2 on my RayDat for weeks, can call

    $ jack_freewheel y
    $ jack_freewheel n

as often as I want and don't have any problems exporting from ardour.
Not in the past and not right now, I've tried like 20 exports in a row,
and all worked like a charm.


I wonder what's so special about your setup. Which jackd2 version do you
use? I've tried a recent git version, no problems at all. What happens
if you run multiple jack_freewheel y/n cycles in a row? Can you trigger
the behaviour?


Cheers
