Thanks for your response, Adrian!  Also, thank you so much for your work on
the hdspm module.

Okay... A little more info on this little bug.

I loaded up a new Ardour3 session this morning, recorded one audio track,
and it exported just fine with Jack2 / Raydat.  I tried exporting 5 times
in a row, and it worked without issue all 5 times.

I loaded up a new Ardour2 session, recorded one track, and it exported just
fine 5 times as well with Jack2 / Raydat.  No problems at all.

I loaded up a new mixbus session, recorded one track, and it exported just
fine 5 times as well with Jack2 / Raydat.  No problems at all.

I then loaded up a finalized session in mixbus with 20 tracks and 10 busses
(in addition to the 8 default mixbus's), as well as 10-20 plugins running,
and tried to export - and it failed with the same aforementioned problem.
 Just hangs, with the "JackFreewheelDriver::Process: Process error" error.
 In order to exit mixbus, I have to kill through a terminal, too.

So... Not sure if that sheds light on anything, but for small simple
sessions, the Jack2 / Raydat combo doesn't seem to have a problem
exporting.  The only problem I've noticed so far is with big sessions on
mixbus.

I'll try big session on A2 / A3 as soon as I am able.

&gt;
&gt;  I've been doing this for 10 years.  I've successfully run the M-audio
&gt;&gt; delta 1010LT, the delta 1010, the Echo Audiofire12, and now the
&gt;&gt; Raydat. The only card which has ever exhibited this behavior is the
&gt;&gt; Raydat, so there is a high likelihood it is the Raydat's issue.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; OTOH, it just works with jackd1. Weird.
&gt;
&gt; I'm running jackd2 on my RayDat for weeks, can call
&gt;
&gt;   $ jack_freewheel y
&gt;   $ jack_freewheel n
&gt;
&gt; as often as I want and don't have any problems exporting from ardour.
&gt; Not in the past and not right now, I've tried like 20 exports in a row,
&gt; and all worked like a charm.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I wonder what's so special about your setup. Which jackd2 version do you
&gt; use? I've tried a recent git version, no problems at all. What happens
&gt; if you run multiple jack_freewheel y/n cycles in a row? Can you trigger
&gt; the behaviour?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
