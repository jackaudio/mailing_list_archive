Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Very frustrating problem with JACK and exporting through mixbus

Thanks for your response, Adrian!  Also, thank you so much for your work on
the hdspm module.

Okay... A little more info on this little bug.

I loaded up a new Ardour3 session this morning, recorded one audio track,
and it exported just fine with Jack2 / Raydat.  I tried exporting 5 times
in a row, and it worked without issue all 5 times.

I loaded up a new Ardour2 session, recorded one track, and it exported just
fine 5 times as well with Jack2 / Raydat.  No problems at all.

I loaded up a new mixbus session, recorded one track, and it exported just
fine 5 times as well with Jack2 / Raydat.  No problems at all.

I then loaded up a finalized session in mixbus with 20 tracks and 10 busses
(in addition to the 8 default mixbus's), as well as 10-20 plugins running,
and tried to export - and it failed with the same aforementioned problem.
 Just hangs, with the "JackFreewheelDriver::Process: Process error" error.
 In order to exit mixbus, I have to kill through a terminal, too.

So... Not sure if that sheds light on anything, but for small simple
sessions, the Jack2 / Raydat combo doesn't seem to have a problem
exporting.  The only problem I've noticed so far is with big sessions on
mixbus.

I'll try big session on A2 / A3 as soon as I am able.
