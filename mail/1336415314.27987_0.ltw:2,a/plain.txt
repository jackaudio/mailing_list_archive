I did and do experience similar issues - problems during export - with
large sessions and automation in A3.

Export either hangs or - if it completes - there are clicks in it.
The source of the problem is invalid automation data. here: only volume
and panning, no plugin/effects are required.

When loading a session that is affected I usually get:
  [WARNING]: Ignoring illegal points on AutomationLine "gain"
messages. Note that ardour3 only shows those messages when loading the
session. The messages do not appear when the automation is created
(here: using a BCF2000).

As workaround I save the session and fix the automation data in .ardour
project file using my favorite text-editor and re-open it.

Previously discussed at
http://old.nabble.com/ardour3-%2B-automation-%2B-fader-desk-td32526713.html

According to Paul there are known issues with the A2/A3 automation
implementation and "we hope that Ben will find some time to port over
the mostly-all-new automation data handling code from mixbus."

Now I'm worried because you experience similar problems in Mixbus.

Can you check the .ardour session-file that fails to export for
automation <events>..</events>. The data between the tags consist of two
numbers per line
  {time in audio-samples} {value}

Here: if the time-value is non-integer (eg. I've seen 14975730.4095213)
or if the value is out of range (negative gain or an exponential number
e.g. 6.22672596364282e-05), export does not work and either hangs or
contains noise.
