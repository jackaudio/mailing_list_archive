&gt; So... Not sure if that sheds light on anything, but for small simple
&gt; sessions, the Jack2 / Raydat combo doesn't seem to have a problem
&gt; exporting.  The only problem I've noticed so far is with big sessions on
&gt; mixbus.

What export parameters are you using (eg. sample rate conversion if any)?

Possibly unconnected, but I've had an ongoing export problem in ardour-2.8.x
for a while now. A simple export with no SRC always works. If I export from
a 48kHz session to 44.1kHz 16-bit with triangular dither it fails about 70%
of the time. Using jack1, when it fails the export window disappears
immediately and the destination file is created but is empty. It
consistently takes 3 or 4 attempts to export.

I haven't tested it with jack2, but I'm guessing there might be a race
condition which is triggered by trying to do more than a simple export.
Changing the interface hasn't made any difference here. It's the same
with a Delta 1010 or RME HDSPe MADI card.
