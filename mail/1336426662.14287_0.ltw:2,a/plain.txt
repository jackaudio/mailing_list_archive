Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Netjack on Windows

I'm trying to use etjack across two Windows XP machines with the goal of
playing audio into one machine and having it play back from the audio out
on the other machine with as little latency as possible.  Eventually, I'd
like to do this over WiFi, but I'll accept a wired connection for now.

I'm running JACK2 1.9.8.  I've tried both the netjack1 and netjack2
configurations, but neither seem to work.  In both cases I get a list of
devices in the control panel on the master machine (in one case I get
system, netjack and the remote machine hostname's devices, in another case
I get only netjack and system).  On the slave machine I either get no
devices (netjack1) or just system (netjack2).

The brief overview of my setup for netjack1:

1. Start jack normally on master
2. jackd -R -S -d netone on slave
3. jack_netsource -H slave_name on master

And for netjack2:

1. Start jack normally on master
2. jack_load netmanager on master
3. jackd -R -S -d net on slave

In both cases I receive no errors.  For jack2 I get "Send: No Error"
repeated continuously.

My two questions:

1. Given my application I think I want to focus on netjack1, based on the
info that indicates netjack2 doesn't support routing audio playback between
the master and slave.  But I don't know if this information on netjack2 is
up-to-date for the version I'm using.

2. Any advice on how to get one or both of these modes working?  I'm not
sure what other information I can provide since no error messages were
reported.

Thanks.
