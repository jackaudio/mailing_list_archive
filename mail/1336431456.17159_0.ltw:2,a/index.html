&gt; Possibly unconnected, but I've had an ongoing export problem in ardour-2.8.x
&gt; for a while now. A simple export with no SRC always works. If I export from
&gt; a 48kHz session to 44.1kHz 16-bit with triangular dither it fails about 70%
&gt; of the time. Using jack1, when it fails the export window disappears
&gt; immediately and the destination file is created but is empty. It
&gt; consistently takes 3 or 4 attempts to export.
I have had the same problem forever. I didn't think anyone else had it, 
though; none of the devs I spoke with had ever seen it. Don't think I 
ever filed a bug report, though... if you already have, could you link 
me to it?

I have only been using jack 2, so it's independent of that.
