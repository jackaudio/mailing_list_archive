&gt;&gt; Possibly unconnected, but I've had an ongoing export problem in ardour-2.8.x
&gt;&gt; for a while now. A simple export with no SRC always works. If I export from
&gt;&gt; a 48kHz session to 44.1kHz 16-bit with triangular dither it fails about 70%
&gt;&gt; of the time. Using jack1, when it fails the export window disappears
&gt;&gt; immediately and the destination file is created but is empty. It
&gt;&gt; consistently takes 3 or 4 attempts to export.
&gt; I have had the same problem forever. I didn't think anyone else had it,  
&gt; though; none of the devs I spoke with had ever seen it. Don't think I  
&gt; ever filed a bug report, though... if you already have, could you link  
&gt; me to it?
&gt;
&gt; I have only been using jack 2, so it's independent of that.

I haven't filed a bug report but have mentioned it a couple of times
on the the Ardour mailing lists. I've been trying to make time to collect
some debugging information, but have been too busy so far.

I guess working at 48kHz or higher and downsampling during export
for CD is such an unusual work flow that hardly anyone encounters this,
but it's standard here. One audio dev (Fons?) once mentioned it on a list,
and one of my Ardour-using colleagues also encounters it frequently.
