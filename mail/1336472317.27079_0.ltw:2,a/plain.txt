I haven't filed a bug report but have mentioned it a couple of times
on the the Ardour mailing lists. I've been trying to make time to collect
some debugging information, but have been too busy so far.

I guess working at 48kHz or higher and downsampling during export
for CD is such an unusual work flow that hardly anyone encounters this,
but it's standard here. One audio dev (Fons?) once mentioned it on a list,
and one of my Ardour-using colleagues also encounters it frequently.
