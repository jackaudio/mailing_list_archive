Subject:     [Jack-Devel] using jack 1 in one pc and jack 2 on the other. is it possible?

hello everyone,
I am building a home studio pc on slackware 13.37 (32bit) .
I have downloaded the jack audio toolkit slackbuild and realised that it is
v0.121.3 which corresponds to jack1 numbering (if i'm not mistaken).

the other pc I want to use in my setup will be running wndows 7 so jack2 is
the only way to go.

will the 2 server communicate?

the audio card will rest upon the linux pc, the windows pc will be a slave
(even though its soundcard will be used, too).

Also can the 2 jack implementations co-exist in the same linux machine? I
could install jack2 in the slackware pc. but will all the applications I
have already built against jack1 work with jack2 out of the box? or will I
have to re-build everything (like ladspa, lv2 synths etcetc)?

Finally how can I choose between using netjack1 or netjack2 in jack1  ?? In
http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack
I can see how to call the -d net or -d netone , depending on which jack i'm
running but not how to use netjack2 with jack1.

Thank you for your help

Thanassis
