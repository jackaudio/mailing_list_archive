Hi,

I've several threads here and in the ardour mailing-list to
ardour-export-errors.

Over a few years it's worked fine under ubuntu 10.04. But since new
ffado-drivers, and jack2 is used in ubuntu grater then 10.04 we have
always problems with the Ardour-Export. The problems are find also in
special distros like ubuntu-studio, dreamstudio or in kxstudio.

Further Ardour 2.8 hangs from time to time by (re)starting a project.

I've try to establish Ardour as an alternative to Samplitude in a public
radio station. The chance was not so bad. But, when it's not possible to
use a functioning set of jack, soundcard-drivers an what is otherwise
necessary, from the repos, I must break down my attempt.

Unfortunately, I and our users are not been suitable to building jackd
etc. from sources. So, if the fixes not available in the
ubuntu-repositorys for 12.04 or furthermore, it's sadly.

I know, that's hard to code for so many environments. And I respect and
be thankfull for the work of all developers (and I also have pay for it)!

But when it's not in the focus, to have a simple to install set, it will
not be carefull for the attempt to build a free alternative! That is
more sadly in a time, that give the possibility to establish
ubuntu-linux as an easy to use and also shiny OS that is really a better
alternative to Win or Mac. And our users is it not mediate that
ubuntu-linux is easy to install and to use, but without ardour and jack.

I hope you are understand my bad english, but above all, my intention or
hope is, that it will be everyone, that can support to update jack etc.
in the repos of the most popular and &gt;up to date&lt; distros.

Best regards Joerg
