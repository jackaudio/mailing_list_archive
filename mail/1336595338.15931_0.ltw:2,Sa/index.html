Hi,

I'm not sure from your email whether this is just an issue with Jack2? Are
you aware Jack1 is also in the 12.04 repos? I just switched mine over
because of another issue.

If this isn't news, sorry for the noise. :-)

Best wishes,

Neil

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've several threads here and in the ardour mailing-list to
&gt; ardour-export-errors.
&gt;
&gt; Over a few years it's worked fine under ubuntu 10.04. But since new
&gt; ffado-drivers, and jack2 is used in ubuntu grater then 10.04 we have
&gt; always problems with the Ardour-Export. The problems are find also in
&gt; special distros like ubuntu-studio, dreamstudio or in kxstudio.
&gt;
&gt; Further Ardour 2.8 hangs from time to time by (re)starting a project.
&gt;
&gt; I've try to establish Ardour as an alternative to Samplitude in a public
&gt; radio station. The chance was not so bad. But, when it's not possible to
&gt; use a functioning set of jack, soundcard-drivers an what is otherwise
&gt; necessary, from the repos, I must break down my attempt.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, I and our users are not been suitable to building jackd
&gt; etc. from sources. So, if the fixes not available in the
&gt; ubuntu-repositorys for 12.04 or furthermore, it's sadly.
&gt;
&gt; I know, that's hard to code for so many environments. And I respect and
&gt; be thankfull for the work of all developers (and I also have pay for it)!
&gt;
&gt; But when it's not in the focus, to have a simple to install set, it will
&gt; not be carefull for the attempt to build a free alternative! That is
&gt; more sadly in a time, that give the possibility to establish
&gt; ubuntu-linux as an easy to use and also shiny OS that is really a better
&gt; alternative to Win or Mac. And our users is it not mediate that
&gt; ubuntu-linux is easy to install and to use, but without ardour and jack.
&gt;
&gt; I hope you are understand my bad english, but above all, my intention or
&gt; hope is, that it will be everyone, that can support to update jack etc.
&gt; in the repos of the most popular and &gt;up to date&lt; distros.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards Joerg
