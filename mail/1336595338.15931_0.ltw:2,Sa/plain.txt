In-Reply-To: JoergSorge [Jack-Devel] Export-Issue fixes available in the ubuntu repositorys? (1336586948.3222_0.ltw:2,Sa)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Export-Issue fixes available in the ubuntu repositorys?

Hi,

I'm not sure from your email whether this is just an issue with Jack2? Are
you aware Jack1 is also in the 12.04 repos? I just switched mine over
because of another issue.

If this isn't news, sorry for the noise. :-)

Best wishes,

Neil
