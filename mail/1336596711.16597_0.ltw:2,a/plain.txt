Update:

I created an A3 session of a 2-minute song with 10 tracks of drums, 4
guitar tracks, 3 vocal tracks, and a bass track, along with about 10-15
active plugins, and everything exported just fine with Jack2.  No hiccups,
the export worked flawlessly.

I'm gonna load on a few more plugins and a few tracks, but it's looking
like this problem might be isolated to Mixbus, and possibly A2.  I haven't
tried any heavy exporting with A2, yet.
