To be honest: no.

But your e-mail address suggests you're from Saalfeld, Germany. I'm from
Jena, which is like 50mins by car.


Since I'm indirectly responsible for FFADO, jackd and Ardour in your
Ubuntu installation (I'm the Debian maintainer for all these packages,
Ubuntu then imports and subtly breaks them depending on the version), I
think you simply send me an e-mail (in German) and we'll then try to
figure out what's wrong.

This might involve some phone calls and maybe even some travelling, but
it's probably the easiest way to solve your problems.



Cheers
