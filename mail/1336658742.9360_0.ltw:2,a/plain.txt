Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Very frustrating problem with JACK and exporting through mixbus

This is I assume a question for Stephane, but how does this happen:

Jack: JackFreewheelDriver::Process master 21332
Jack: Process: graph not finished!
Jack: Process: waiting to switch delta = 5589
JackEngine::XRun: client = ardour was not run: state = 2
JackFreewheelDriver::Process: Process error
Jack: ThreadHandler: exit
Jack: fPollTable i = 1 fd = 10

How do you get XRun in freewheel mode?  I thought xrun meant that the
processing was not finished before the next period processing had to
begin, but in freewheel mode the period processing was not driven by a
timer, only by the processes finishing.

What platform are you running (Windows, OSX, Linux)?  The typical way of
capturing would be to start the process and use the console redirection to
send all output to a file, so there would be no doubt about capturing all
of the output:

jackd -d alsa -r 48000 -p 512 -n 3 > jack_log.txt

That puts all the command line output from jackd into the file
jack_log.txt.

The redirection operator ">" is a unix convention, so it works on Linux
and OSX, and from a quick test seems to work as expected on Windows as
well.

I think people usually just put it in the body of an email.
