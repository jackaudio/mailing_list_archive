They are different issues here:

- why does Ardour cause XRun in the first place ? (freewheel mode use a time out [waiting for the graph to finish], maybe the value is not set correctly. I need to look at that.

- why does the freewheel thread exits in case of error ? Here I need to check what happens in jack1 (in case this is similar).

&gt; This is I assume a question for Stephane, but how does this happen:
&gt; 
&gt; Jack: JackFreewheelDriver::Process master 21332
&gt; Jack: Process: graph not finished!
&gt; Jack: Process: waiting to switch delta = 5589
&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = ardour was not run: state = 2
&gt; JackFreewheelDriver::Process: Process error
&gt; Jack: ThreadHandler: exit
&gt; Jack: fPollTable i = 1 fd = 10
&gt; 
&gt; How do you get XRun in freewheel mode?  I thought xrun meant that the
&gt; processing was not finished before the next period processing had to
&gt; begin, but in freewheel mode the period processing was not driven by a
&gt; timer, only by the processes finishing.

&gt; What platform are you running (Windows, OSX, Linux)?  The typical way of
&gt; capturing would be to start the process and use the console redirection to
&gt; send all output to a file, so there would be no doubt about capturing all
&gt; of the output:
&gt; 
&gt; jackd -d alsa -r 48000 -p 512 -n 3 &gt; jack_log.txt
&gt; 
&gt; That puts all the command line output from jackd into the file
&gt; jack_log.txt.
&gt; 
&gt; The redirection operator "&gt;" is a unix convention, so it works on Linux
&gt; and OSX, and from a quick test seems to work as expected on Windows as
&gt; well.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I hope the protocol for pasting large amounts of text is by pastbin
&gt; 
&gt; I think people usually just put it in the body of an email.
