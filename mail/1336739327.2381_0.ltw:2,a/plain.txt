Subject:     [Jack-Devel] problem with jack's watchdog killing jackd process after a 3-4 seconds of operation

hello everyone,
i'm trying to setup jack in a slackware box.

I have installed and enabled set_rlimits and can get jack to powerup , but
that only last a few seconds..
Then the watchdog kills the jack process. why? under what circumstances
does that happen?

here is the dump:

nass@starmass:~$ set_rlimits jackd -d alsa
jackd 0.121.2

I should inform you that i have setup this slackware as a virtualbox guest.
before you start your raids, i should also inform you that I'm not planning
to get a production machine
so its OK if i get xruns in this vm guest. but jackd should run, no??

Thank you for your help,
Nass
