&gt; hello everyone,
&gt; i'm trying to setup jack in a slackware box.
&gt;
&gt; I have installed and enabled set_rlimits and can get jack to powerup , but
&gt; that only last a few seconds..
&gt; Then the watchdog kills the jack process. why? under what circumstances does
&gt; that happen?

(1) the watchdog kills the whole show if no apparent progress is made.
In your case, given the absence of clients, that probably means that
the backend is never woken, and so jackd appears to the watchdog to be
stuck, rather than just waiting for a wakeup from the audio interface.
You could run with -r which will not involve the watchdog but that is
just going to mask the actual problem, which is probably something to
do with the linkage between the VM's ALSA driver and the real thing.

(2) it may be possible to run jack successfully on a VM, but i don't
personally find it interesting and have no intent of trying to debug
why it doesn't work. I believe that a few people have managed this in
the past, but it presumably depends a lot on the implementation of the
specific VM (and may even depend on the implementation of the host
system drivers. Other people might have some further insight into the
issues, but I don't expect to.
