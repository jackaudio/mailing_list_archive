For what it's worth, I successfully use set_rlimits myself on a Slackware
box and have been doing so for many years.  Therefore I doubt we're dealing
with a fundamental problem in the audio stack (set_rlimits, jack or ALSA). 
As Paul said, it's more likely something to do with the way the audio
hardware is being virtualised in your VM - given real hardware the software
mix that you're using is fine.
