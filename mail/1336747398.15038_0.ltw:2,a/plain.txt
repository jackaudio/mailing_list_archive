Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] problem with jack's watchdog killing jackd process after a 3-4 seconds of operation

Yup with -P or -C alone, jack runs. I could call this discussion 'sensibly
closed',
but I'd like to check a few more things with those of you who have
successfully run jack in a  vm guest.

My virtualbox host, is a server (slackware too). so no rt kernel, no
low-latency desktop and the rest. could that affect the ability of the alsa
on the host to provide duplex audio functionality?
In virtualbox I am using the 'alsa' driver and exposing the AC97 codec on
the guest. HDA intel didn't offer much different results though.

Thank you for your help!
unfortunately, the plan to have this vm guest as a fx engine can't be
utilized :(

BUT (just had a -hopefully- brilliant idea) what if I forget about alsa,
and I use this jack server as a slave using the net backend????
could i do that and forget about the real hw ports?
