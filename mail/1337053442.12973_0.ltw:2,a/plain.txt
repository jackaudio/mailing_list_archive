Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Windows application

I'm interested in using JACK to stream audio from the microphone input 
of one Windows PC to the speaker output of another Windows PC, over a 
LAN with as little latency as possible.  Eventually, I'll add Linux 
devices to the mix, but I'm currently using Windows machines for testing.

Can anyone advise if there is a jack-enabled application that can 
perform this task?  I've looked through the website but couldn't find 
anything that seemed to suit my requirements.  Alternatively, is there 
an FAQ anywhere that provides information on how to set up this type of 
system?  I've tried following a few of the netjack configuration guides 
from the wiki, but they seem to be either outdated or incompatible with 
the Windows version of jack.

If anyone has done this or something similar and can provide a little 
guidance, it would be greatly appreciated.
