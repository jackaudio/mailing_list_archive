Subject: [Jack-Devel] Windows application
 
I'm interested in using JACK to stream audio from the microphone input of one Windows PC to the speaker output of another Windows PC, over a LAN with as little latency as possible.  Eventually, I'll add Linux devices to the mix, but I'm currently using Windows machines for testing.

Can anyone advise if there is a jack-enabled application that can perform this task?  I've looked through the website but couldn't find anything that seemed to suit my requirements.  Alternatively, is there an FAQ anywhere that provides information on how to set up this type of system?  I've tried following a few of the netjack configuration guides from the wiki, but they seem to be either outdated or incompatible with the Windows version of jack.

If anyone has done this or something similar and can provide a little guidance, it would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Dave,

I don't think you need any jack-enabled app for this. All you need is ... jack (and qjackctl) :)
Make one windows machine the jack 
net-master, the other the jack net-slave. I believe you can use the 
"net" or "netone" backend on the slave, while the master will have the 
"netmanager" in-process client running (look at the jack2 doc on how to 
start it, i don't remember it, it's been a while). The slave can expose its h/w inputs to the jack graph. You would then connect the corresponding 
jack ports to the system:playback ports (still on the slave). On the 
master, you simply connect the slave capture ports to whatever playback 
ports you want (e.g. system playback ports linked to your h/w outputs, 
speakers, etc).

It is quite easy and does not 
require any special application save for jack and qjackctl for 
easy-to-use virtual connection patchbay. 


Cheers!
J.
