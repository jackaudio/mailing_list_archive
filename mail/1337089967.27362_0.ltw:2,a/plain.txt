apt has a problem with not having an easy way to remove a package without
also removing things that depend on it. its one of the few notably nice
things about rpm's "--nodepends" option.

you can basically NEVER have parallel JACK installs (its technically
possible but almost everyone gets one little detail of it wrong and then
wierdness happens and they can't track down why)

if you want to try that, just build with --prefix=/usr and then later do a
forced reinstall of the original package.
