easiest way to solve the apt-dependency’s is to create a dummy package,
eg. a empty package with a high version number to solve the dependency’s
and replace the distro-jack with "nothing". With such a dummy package
installed you can switch the jack version when ever you like.
Then install witch jack version you like.

A other way is just download the (debian) source package, grep the
debian folder out, update the changelog and move it (the debian
directory) into the new source. Then build the jack debian packages and
install them with dpkg -i package
They will smoothly replace the distro-jack-package as an upgrade.
