that easy, but I still can't seem to get it to work.  To be completely
clear on what I'm doing... I'm running between two WinXP laptops, using the
integrated mic and speakers.  Both PCs are connected to the same hub on a
LAN.


On the master machine I start jack as follows:

jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "DirectSound::IDT Audio"




It appears to start without errors.

On the slave machine I start jack with:

jackd  -R -d net

(I tried running jack2 using netone instead, but this just gives me
"Initing net driver fails..." and never shows up on the server machine.)

It also appears to start without error.  Shortly thereafter it connects
with the server machine and I now have "system" and the remote machine
listed in the server graph list and just "system" devices listed on the
slave machine.   (I've tried running jackd -netmanager on the master but
get an error that netmanager is already running.)

At this point, the only patching I can do it to cross-patch the slave ports
and server ports on the server machine.  (slave machine only has one set of
system ports listed).  But that doesn't seem to do anything.

Am I missing something simple in the configuration or usage?

Thanks.
