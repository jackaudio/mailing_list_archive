Hi Dave,

Just what I said: start the 'netmanager' on the master: 'jack_load netmanager' (you will need to open the DOS window in the jack2 directory, just look in the Jack menu items in your Start menu, there should be a shortcut to such DOS window).

The netmanager is an "in-process" client that waits for net-slave connections and transfers data from/to master to/from slaves.


J.

&gt;Hi Dave, 
&gt;&#xA0;
&gt;I don't think you need any jack-enabled app for this. All you need is ... jack (and qjackctl) :) 
&gt;Make one windows machine the jack net-master, the other the jack net-slave. I believe you can use the "net" or "netone" backend on the slave, while the master will have the "netmanager" in-process client running (look at the jack2 doc on how to start it, i don't remember it, it's been a while). The slave can expose its h/w inputs to the jack graph. You would then connect the corresponding jack ports to the system:playback ports (still on the slave). On the master, you simply connect the slave capture ports to whatever playback ports you want (e.g. system playback ports linked to your h/w outputs, speakers, etc).
&gt;&#xA0;
&gt;It is quite easy and does not require any special application save for jack and qjackctl for easy-to-use virtual connection patchbay.
&gt;&#xA0;
&gt;Cheers!

It would seem that it should be that easy, but I still can't seem to get it to work.&#xA0; To be completely clear on what I'm doing... I'm running between two WinXP laptops, using the integrated mic and speakers.&#xA0; Both PCs are connected to the same hub on a LAN. 
&#xA0;
On the master machine I start jack as follows:
&#xA0;
jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "DirectSound::IDT Audio"
&#xA0;
&#xA0;
It appears to start without errors.
&#xA0;
On the slave machine I start jack with:
&#xA0;
jackd&#xA0; -R -d net
&#xA0;
(I tried running jack2 using netone instead, but this just gives me "Initing net driver fails..." and never shows up on the server machine.)&#xA0;
&#xA0;
It also appears to start without error.&#xA0; Shortly thereafter it connects with the server machine and I now have "system" and the remote machine listed in the server graph list and just "system" devices listed on the slave machine.&#xA0;&#xA0; (I've tried running jackd -netmanager on the master but get an error that netmanager is already running.)&#xA0;
&#xA0;
At this point, the only patching I can do it to cross-patch the slave ports and server ports on the server machine.&#xA0; (slave machine only has one set of system ports listed).&#xA0; But that doesn't seem to do anything.
&#xA0;
Am I missing something simple in the configuration or usage?
&#xA0;
Thanks.
&#xA0;- Dave&#xA0;
