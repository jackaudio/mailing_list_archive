Hi Dave,

Just what I said: start the 'netmanager' on the master: 'jack_load netmanager' (you will need to open the DOS window in the jack2 directory, just look in the Jack menu items in your Start menu, there should be a shortcut to such DOS window).

The netmanager is an "in-process" client that waits for net-slave connections and transfers data from/to master to/from slaves.


J.

I believe you can use the "net" or "netone" backend on the slave, while the master will have the "netmanager" in-process client running (look at the jack2 doc on how to start it, i don't remember it, it's been a while). The slave can expose its h/w inputs to the jack graph. You would then connect the corresponding jack ports to the system:playback ports (still on the slave). On the master, you simply connect the slave capture ports to whatever playback ports you want (e.g. system playback ports linked to your h/w outputs, speakers, etc).

It would seem that it should be that easy, but I still can't seem to get it to work.  To be completely clear on what I'm doing... I'm running between two WinXP laptops, using the integrated mic and speakers.  Both PCs are connected to the same hub on a LAN. 
 
On the master machine I start jack as follows:
 
jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "DirectSound::IDT Audio"
 
 
It appears to start without errors.
 
On the slave machine I start jack with:
 
jackd  -R -d net
 
(I tried running jack2 using netone instead, but this just gives me "Initing net driver fails..." and never shows up on the server machine.) 
 
It also appears to start without error.  Shortly thereafter it connects with the server machine and I now have "system" and the remote machine listed in the server graph list and just "system" devices listed on the slave machine.   (I've tried running jackd -netmanager on the master but get an error that netmanager is already running.) 
 
At this point, the only patching I can do it to cross-patch the slave ports and server ports on the server machine.  (slave machine only has one set of system ports listed).  But that doesn't seem to do anything.
 
Am I missing something simple in the configuration or usage?
 
Thanks.
