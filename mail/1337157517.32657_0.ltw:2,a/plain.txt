JFTR: You can use dpkg -r --force-depends or even --force-all to
uninstall something without touching back- and forward-dependencies.

However, next time you dist-upgrade the system, the then missing
dependency is reinstalled, so the approach is temporary at best.

The "proper" way of handling the situation at hand is to overwrite the
installed versions by providing the correct prefix (/usr/) and nowadays
also the correct libdir in case of multiarch, e.g. /usr/lib/x86_64/ when
compiling jackd manually. (you have already mentioned the first, I
wanted to make folks aware of the latter)


Cheers
