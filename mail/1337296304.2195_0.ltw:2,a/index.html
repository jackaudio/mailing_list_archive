As it turns out, I was doing this correctly.  Until I run netmanager, I
don't see the slave machine on the master's graph at all.  Once I run
netmanager, I get the slave machine on the master.  The slave shows the
slave and master machine names and that it's providing 2 send channels and
2 return channels.  I then cross-patch the slave's outputs to the master's
inputs and vice versa.  However, I'm still not hearing one machine's mic on
the other's speakers, and playback of any audio plays on the local machine
normally and doesn't go over jack.

One thing that's not clear to me is netjack1 vs. netjack2.   The only way
I'm able to start the slave is with "-d net" (netjack1).  If I try to start
netjack2 (-d netone), I get the error "initing net driver fails".

Then I run "jack_load netmanager" on the master to get everything going,
but this is documented as netjack2.   If I run the netjack1 netmanager
"jack_netsource -H X.X.X.X [slave IP]", I get a virtuallock error.

Assuming none of that is a problem as long as I see the slave in the
master's graph, when I run netmanager, I get a "cannon read named pipe
name" error in main jack master window. But once I start the slave, I get
the network parameters, it waits for slave and syncs with latency 4.

Any other thoughts?  It seems everything is working properly, if a little
different than the documentation that I've read, but it's not working as I
expect it to.

Thanks again.

&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; Just what I said: start the 'netmanager' on the master: 'jack_load
&gt; netmanager' (you will need to open the DOS window in the jack2 directory,
&gt; just look in the Jack menu items in your Start menu, there should be a
&gt; shortcut to such DOS window).
&gt; The netmanager is an "in-process" client that waits for net-slave
&gt; connections and transfers data from/to master to/from slaves.

&gt; &gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't think you need any jack-enabled app for this. All you need is ...
&gt; &gt; jack (and qjackctl) :)
&gt; &gt; Make one windows machine the jack net-master, the other the jack net-slave.
&gt; &gt; I believe you can use the "net" or "netone" backend on the slave, while the
&gt; &gt; master will have the "netmanager" in-process client running (look at the
&gt; &gt; jack2 doc on how to start it, i don't remember it, it's been a while). The
&gt; &gt; slave can expose its h/w inputs to the jack graph. You would then connect
&gt; &gt; the corresponding jack ports to the system:playback ports (still on the
&gt; &gt; slave). On the master, you simply connect the slave capture ports to
&gt; &gt; whatever playback ports you want (e.g. system playback ports linked to your
&gt; &gt; h/w outputs, speakers, etc).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is quite easy and does not require any special application save for jack
&gt; &gt; and qjackctl for easy-to-use virtual connection patchbay.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers!
&gt; &gt; J.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; that easy, but I still can't seem to get it to work.  To be completely
&gt; clear on what I'm doing... I'm running between two WinXP laptops, using the
&gt; integrated mic and speakers.  Both PCs are connected to the same hub on a
&gt; LAN.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On the master machine I start jack as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "DirectSound::IDT Audio"
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It appears to start without errors.
&gt; 
&gt; On the slave machine I start jack with:
&gt; 
&gt; jackd  -R -d net
&gt; 
&gt; (I tried running jack2 using netone instead, but this just gives me
&gt; "Initing net driver fails..." and never shows up on the server machine.)
&gt; 
&gt; It also appears to start without error.  Shortly thereafter it connects
&gt; with the server machine and I now have "system" and the remote machine
&gt; listed in the server graph list and just "system" devices listed on the
&gt; slave machine.   (I've tried running jackd -netmanager on the master but
&gt; get an error that netmanager is already running.)
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, the only patching I can do it to cross-patch the slave ports
&gt; and server ports on the server machine.  (slave machine only has one set of
&gt; system ports listed).  But that doesn't seem to do anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something simple in the configuration or usage?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
