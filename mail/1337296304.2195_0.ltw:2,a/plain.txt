Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows application

As it turns out, I was doing this correctly.  Until I run netmanager, I
don't see the slave machine on the master's graph at all.  Once I run
netmanager, I get the slave machine on the master.  The slave shows the
slave and master machine names and that it's providing 2 send channels and
2 return channels.  I then cross-patch the slave's outputs to the master's
inputs and vice versa.  However, I'm still not hearing one machine's mic on
the other's speakers, and playback of any audio plays on the local machine
normally and doesn't go over jack.

One thing that's not clear to me is netjack1 vs. netjack2.   The only way
I'm able to start the slave is with "-d net" (netjack1).  If I try to start
netjack2 (-d netone), I get the error "initing net driver fails".

Then I run "jack_load netmanager" on the master to get everything going,
but this is documented as netjack2.   If I run the netjack1 netmanager
"jack_netsource -H X.X.X.X [slave IP]", I get a virtuallock error.

Assuming none of that is a problem as long as I see the slave in the
master's graph, when I run netmanager, I get a "cannon read named pipe
name" error in main jack master window. But once I start the slave, I get
the network parameters, it waits for slave and syncs with latency 4.

Any other thoughts?  It seems everything is working properly, if a little
different than the documentation that I've read, but it's not working as I
expect it to.

Thanks again.
