Just an update on this...

I just created a full project with a combination of 39 tracks and busses
with A3, and with Jack2 everything exported just fine.  I haven't been able
to export anything but very small projects with mixbus and Jack2.  The
issue definitely seems to be related to mixbus, Jack2 and the size of the
project.

&gt;&gt; Hey guys..  I recently acquired a RME Raydat interface (works like a
&gt;&gt; *charm*, and I love it!), but ever since I installed it, I'm getting a
&gt;&gt; random error when I try to export my tracks, and it's driving me bonkers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Previously to installing the Raydat card, I had used ardour for
&gt;&gt; approximately 10 years, and have never experienced this problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The problem is about 75% of the time, when exporting, the GUI will just
&gt;&gt; sit there and do nothing, maintaining the "export" button depressed
&gt;&gt; continually.   Within QJackctl's "message" window, I see the following
&gt;&gt; error:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = ardour was not run: state = 2
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; JackFreewheelDriver::Process: Process error
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 00:31:20.920 XRUN callback (1).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The remaining 25% of the time it exports just fine, without issue.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating.  Googling the problem
&gt;&gt; returns nothing but the snippet of code which contains the error message
&gt;&gt; itself, which can be found at the link below:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; http://www.trac.jackaudio.org/browser/jack2/branches/pipelining/common/JackFreewheelDriver.cpp?rev=4306
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.  If more info is needed, please
&gt;&gt; let me know what I can get you.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, thanks to everyone who assured me that the Raydat card works well
&gt;&gt; under Linux.  It really does work like a charm.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

&gt; I've since found that this problem only occurs in Jack2.  Jack1 exports
&gt; 100% of the time just fine, but I've found that Jack2 (aside from the
&gt; export problem) works much better under high stress.  Most of my projects
&gt; contain a high number of tracks / plugins / etc... Thus, high stress.  It'd
&gt; be very nice to go back to Jack2, but not being able to export pretty much
&gt; kills any usefulness from it.  Any ideas at all?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance.
