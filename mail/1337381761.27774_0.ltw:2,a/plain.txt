ok time to be clear on this confusing jack nomenclature.

Jack1 and Jack2 and Netjack1 and Netjack2 have different commands for 
equivalent actions.

In Jack2 the -d net option calls up the Netjack2 driver.

In Jack1 the -d net option calls up the Netjack1 driver. Netjack2 is not 
available for Jack1

The Netone driver is only available under Jack2 - it is  Netjack1 for 
Jack2 - you simply call up -d netone.

Now it gets silly...connecting audio I/O for Netjack1 is different to 
connecting Netjack2

for Netone/(and Netjack1?) =

      -i, --audio-ins     Number of capture channels (defaults to 2) 
(default: 2)
     -o, --audio-outs     Number of playback channels (defaults to 2) 
(default: 2)
     -I, --midi-ins     Number of midi capture channels (defaults to 1) 
(default: 1)
     -O, --midi-outs     Number of midi playback channels (defaults to 1)

for Netjack2

     -C, --input-ports     Number of audio input ports. If -1, audio 
physical input from the master (default: -1)
     -P, --output-ports     Number of audio output ports. If -1, audio 
physical output from the master (default: -1)
     -i, --midi-in-ports     Number of midi input ports (default: 0)
     -o, --midi-out-ports     Number of midi output ports (default: 0)

So to sum up - if you're using Jack2, you can choose to use 
Netjack2/jack_load netmanager or Netone/jack_netsource

For Jack1 Netjack1(-d net)  is you're only option.

My strong recommendation is to use Jack2 as it is more robust and 
Netjack2 is far superior now to Netjack1 and Netone.

Also, jack transport is currently (very unfortunately) disabled in 
Netjack2, and quite broken here (3 second delay before slave chases master).
in both Netone/Jack2 and Netjack1/Jack1.

This really should have been long ago, but ...
