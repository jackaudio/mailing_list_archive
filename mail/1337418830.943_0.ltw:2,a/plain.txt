Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jackd2: buffer alignment

Hi!

I'm in the middle of a little benchmark. It looks like that jackd2's
jack_port_get_buffer returns 16-byte aligned buffers, but AVX expects a
32-byte alignment.

Before I spend hours to locate the corresponding line in the jackd2
source code, I thought I better ask. ;) Can somebody point me in the
right direction?


TIA
