Thanks - this is extremely helpful and clarifies what I should be doing.

Since I'm on Windows I'm running Jack2.  I start the master as normal 
(jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "audio interface"), the slave starts with 
"jackd -R -S -d net", and the master then gets "jack_load netmanager".  
Again, everything seems to work - slave shows up in master's graph, it 
shows synching with latency 4, and I can cross-patch the ins on the 
slave to the outs on the master, and vice versa.  I'm still not getting 
audio from either machines mic to the other's speakers, or by playing 
back files on either machine.  Playback is still coming from the local 
machine's audio hardware and never from the remote machine.  There must 
be a step I'm missing somewhere.

One question I have... on the slave machine, how does jack know which 
audio hardware I'm using?  I haven't defined it with a -d option like I 
did on the master.

Other than for that, I'm at a loss for next steps.
