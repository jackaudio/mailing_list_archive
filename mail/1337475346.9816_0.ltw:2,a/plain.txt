it's working by the sound of it. just try playing a wavefile on the 
slave machine first to ensure your problem is not with  muted mic 
channels or whatnot. I'm on linux so cannot comment further about 
specifics, however the principles are the same i believe.

There is no local HW connection in jack on the slave machine -  the 
'driver' is the Netjack2 driver -dnet ;)

If you wanted to use your local HW with jack on the slave you would need 
to stop Jack first then restart using  -d (your HW driver here), same as 
with your Master machine, but of course Netjack2 would not operate. Jack 
cannot mount 2 '-d's'  at the same time.
