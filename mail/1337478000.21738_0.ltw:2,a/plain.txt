I assume you've clicked and dragged connections between the I/O's . great.

Here's yet another confusing nomenclature error - the Patchbay in 
Qjackctl is a powerful tool but it's not really a patchbay. The 
connections window is the actual patchbay. In Qjackctl the  Patchbay is 
list of connections made in the Connections window which can be 
saved/retrieved at a later date. That way when a client appears in the 
Jack graph the "preset" connections saved in the running Patchbay file 
will be made and the audio pathways activated automatically. It's great. 
Just click the "New" button in the patchbay to create a snapshot of your 
existing Audio/Midi connections and save to disk.

Another issue with nomenclature is with the column headings in the 
Conections window. The LH says Readable Clients/Output Ports  ( which is 
wrong) and Writable Clients/Input Ports which is also wrong. Inuts on 
the left Outputs on the right.

Apart from that little gripe, Qjackctl is a mighty piece of soft. :)

1.9.8 is the latest binary of Jack2 for Windows i think. Google is your 
friend here.
