&gt; I assume you've clicked and dragged connections between the I/O's . 
&gt; great.
&gt;
&gt; Here's yet another confusing nomenclature error - the Patchbay in 
&gt; Qjackctl is a powerful tool but it's not really a patchbay. The 
&gt; connections window is the actual patchbay. In Qjackctl the  Patchbay 
&gt; is list of connections made in the Connections window which can be 
&gt; saved/retrieved at a later date. That way when a client appears in the 
&gt; Jack graph the "preset" connections saved in the running Patchbay file 
&gt; will be made and the audio pathways activated automatically. It's 
&gt; great. Just click the "New" button in the patchbay to create a 
&gt; snapshot of your existing Audio/Midi connections and save to disk.
&gt;
&gt; Another issue with nomenclature is with the column headings in the 
&gt; Conections window. The LH says Readable Clients/Output Ports  ( which 
&gt; is wrong) and Writable Clients/Input Ports which is also wrong. Inuts 
&gt; on the left Outputs on the right.
&gt;
&gt; Apart from that little gripe, Qjackctl is a mighty piece of soft. :)
&gt;
&gt; 1.9.8 is the latest binary of Jack2 for Windows i think. Google is 
&gt; your friend here.
&gt;

I was doing it right by using the Connect panel.  I don't think the 
input/output naming would be a problem because I'm connecting them to 
each other, so it doesn't really matter for my application.

My point with the version is that 1.9.8 has been the latest Windows 
version at least for a few weeks, so if there was a fix made in the past 
few days, it's probably not rolled into that version of the Windows 
binaries yet.  Maybe that's the issue?  If there are pre-release Windows 
binaries somewhere, maybe they would be worth trying.
