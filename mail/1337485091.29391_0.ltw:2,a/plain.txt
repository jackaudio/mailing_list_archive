I was doing it right by using the Connect panel.  I don't think the 
input/output naming would be a problem because I'm connecting them to 
each other, so it doesn't really matter for my application.

My point with the version is that 1.9.8 has been the latest Windows 
version at least for a few weeks, so if there was a fix made in the past 
few days, it's probably not rolled into that version of the Windows 
binaries yet.  Maybe that's the issue?  If there are pre-release Windows 
binaries somewhere, maybe they would be worth trying.
