Ah, ok.. the Mic is on the slave machine. That won't work. You need to swap your machines around. The slave won't work with HW unless you use alas-in Alsa-out and that won't work on windows.  Just make your slave machine your master and you're good.

That's exactly what I did.  Audio file plays normally on the Windows machine, same as if jack wasn't running.

In this case, if I have multiple audio interfaces on the slave machine, how does it know which ones to expose via netjack?
