&gt;&gt; I assume you've clicked and dragged connections between the I/O's . great.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Here's yet another confusing nomenclature error - the Patchbay in Qjackctl is a powerful tool but it's not really a patchbay. The connections window is the actual patchbay. In Qjackctl the  Patchbay is list of connections made in the Connections window which can be saved/retrieved at a later date. That way when a client appears in the Jack graph the "preset" connections saved in the running Patchbay file will be made and the audio pathways activated automatically. It's great. Just click the "New" button in the patchbay to create a snapshot of your existing Audio/Midi connections and save to disk.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Another issue with nomenclature is with the column headings in the Conections window. The LH says Readable Clients/Output Ports  ( which is wrong) and Writable Clients/Input Ports which is also wrong. Inuts on the left Outputs on the right.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Apart from that little gripe, Qjackctl is a mighty piece of soft. :)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1.9.8 is the latest binary of Jack2 for Windows i think. Google is your friend here.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I was doing it right by using the Connect panel.  I don't think the input/output naming would be a problem because I'm connecting them to each other, so it doesn't really matter for my application.
&gt; 
&gt; My point with the version is that 1.9.8 has been the latest Windows version at least for a few weeks, so if there was a fix made in the past few days, it's probably not rolled into that version of the Windows binaries yet.  Maybe that's the issue?  If there are pre-release Windows binaries somewhere, maybe they would be worth trying.

Here 1.9.9 beta:

Pure 32 bits version: http://jackaudio.org/downloads/Jack_v1.9.9_32_setup.exe 

Mixed 64/32 bits version: http://jackaudio.org/downloads/Jack_v1.9.9_64_setup.exe
