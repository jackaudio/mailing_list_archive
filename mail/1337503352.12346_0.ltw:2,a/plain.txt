In Qjackctl the  Patchbay is list of connections made in the Connections window which can be saved/retrieved at a later date. That way when a client appears in the Jack graph the "preset" connections saved in the running Patchbay file will be made and the audio pathways activated automatically. It's great. Just click the "New" button in the patchbay to create a snapshot of your existing Audio/Midi connections and save to disk.

Maybe that's the issue?  If there are pre-release Windows binaries somewhere, maybe they would be worth trying.
