Hi Dave,

In netjack terms, "master" has the real audio hardware and the slaves connect
to the master and use its audio hardware.  They do not (need to) have real
audio hardware.

Master Audio In -&gt; network -&gt; Slave {do stuff} -&gt; network -&gt; Master Audio Out

Of course, you can still have any JACK client connecting to JACK on the Slave,
of course, as well as on the master.

If you want to access the Slave Audio In or Slave Audio Out, you'll need a JACK
client application that provides that access.  I believe these exist on Linux
for ALSA hardware.  On Windows, you could use an ASIO app with JackRouter if
nothing else.

Hope that helps.

&gt; I'm interested in using JACK to stream audio from the microphone input of one

&gt; I'm currently using Windows machines for testing.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone advise if there is a jack-enabled application that can perform this
&gt; task?  I've looked through the website but couldn't find anything that seemed
&gt; to suit my requirements.  Alternatively, is there an FAQ anywhere that provides
&gt; information on how to set up this type of system?  I've tried following a few
&gt; of the netjack configuration guides from the wiki, but they seem to be either
&gt; outdated or incompatible with the Windows version of jack.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has done this or something similar and can provide a little guidance,
&gt; it would be greatly appreciated.
