Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows application

Hi Dave,

In netjack terms, "master" has the real audio hardware and the slaves connect
to the master and use its audio hardware.  They do not (need to) have real
audio hardware.

Master Audio In -> network -> Slave {do stuff} -> network -> Master Audio Out

Of course, you can still have any JACK client connecting to JACK on the Slave,
of course, as well as on the master.

If you want to access the Slave Audio In or Slave Audio Out, you'll need a JACK
client application that provides that access.  I believe these exist on Linux
for ALSA hardware.  On Windows, you could use an ASIO app with JackRouter if
nothing else.

Hope that helps.
