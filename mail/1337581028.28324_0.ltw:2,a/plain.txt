To the OP,

I forgot to mention that the _slave_ needs to load the audioadapter:

jack_load audioadapter

Master: jack_load netmanager
Slave: jack_load audioadapter

The "audioadapter" in jack2 is the equivalent of alsa_in / alsa_out but as an in-process client.
I do not know the quality of this client today when compared to alsa_in/out or even Fons Adriaensen's zita-a2j stuff. Stephane Letz can shed some light here.


In any case, just give it a go, it is the jack2 way of bringing the slave h/w into the jack network.


J.
