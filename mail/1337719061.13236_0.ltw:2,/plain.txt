(This could be complete nonsense - I'm no expert on this)

IIRC, when you make changes to limits.conf then a re-login is
required for them to be effective. Which would logically imply
that a login is required before anything in limits.conf is applied.

Don't know if this is 'basic system' cq PAM behaviour or something
added by consolekit or policykit or similar - nothing as confusing
(and in the end insecure) as parallel security systems.
