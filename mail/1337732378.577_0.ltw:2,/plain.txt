Depends on the context you're doing it in.  Generally, the best
approach is to use the system library hooks for whatever language
you're programming in to do it.  When it comes to bourne shell (which
doesn't have any native hooks to setgid/setuid), personally, I'm a big
fan of the supervision utilities written by djb
(http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html) and by extension runit
(http://smarden.org/runit/) which is more or less a clone of
daemontools but more commonly found packaged in distros; both of these
include great tools for switching uid/gid from within bourne shell,
but I wouldn't use them outside of scripting daemon startup/shutdown.
