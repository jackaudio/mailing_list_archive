I'm  a daemontools  fan  too,  but I  don't  think softlimit  supports
setting the  RT priority stuff  that jackd requires  so it is  no help
here.  Even  if it did that  would duplicate configuration  in the PAM
and daemontools installations which irks me a little.

runit looks interesting (thanks for the link) but it's a complete Sysv
init  replacement, which  is a  lot of  work just  to get  one service
running properly.

It would  be nice to  just wrap  a script in  a PAM service.   Do such
wrappers  exist?  Or are  they too  much of  a security  nightmare?  I
suspect I'll end up adding pam_limits to /etc/pam.d/su , unless that's
also a security no-no.

Thanks for your help, some very interesting stuff there.
