&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chances are your PAM stack isn't configured to use pam_limits.so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for su sessions, which means using su won't pay any attention to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the setttings in  limits.conf until it is.  That  said, don't do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.  Using  su programatically to  switch users is a  bad idea
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becuase su's behavior is notoriously unportable anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, is there any good  way to programatically switch users?  I ask
&gt; &gt; &gt; because I have been  trying to do that with su and  I hit the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem as the OP.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ...  I'm a  big  fan of  the  supervision utilities  written by  djb
&gt; &gt; (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html)    and    by   extension    runit
&gt; &gt; (http://smarden.org/runit/)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm  a daemontools  fan  too,  but I  don't  think softlimit  supports
&gt; setting the  RT priority stuff  that jackd requires  so it is  no help
&gt; here.

Correct, it doesn't, but then it doesn't have to as long as you have
bash lying around given that it's ulimit builtin can handle the
rlimits.

&gt; Even  if it did that  would duplicate configuration  in the PAM
&gt; and daemontools installations which irks me a little.

Hrm, I don't see it as a duplication.  I see it as simplification.  If
you don't need to broker and determine authorization, then don't
involve PAM.  Neither setting rlimits or switching users requires
additional authorization when the process is already running as
superuser to start with; involving PAM and making it do the call to
setrlimit at the time of the user switch only means you've added
indirection to the code path and actually made things less obvious.  I
suppose you might want to think of limits.conf as the single control
point of what resource limits any process of given user or group has,
but that's not what it is and wishing won't make it so, nor will any
amount of system reconfiguration.

&gt; runit looks interesting (thanks for the link) but it's a complete Sysv
&gt; init  replacement, which  is a  lot of  work just  to get  one service
&gt; running properly.

No no, it isn't exclusively a replacement, it *can* be, but IMO isn't
that good at it (I think the service dependancy setup is too awkward
to justify).  I'd use upstart or systemd before I replaced init with
runit, which says a lot if you knew how much disdain I hold for both
of those particular pieces of software.  Ubuntu and Debian both have
a runit package which, if you install it, works just like daemontools
in that it runs in concert with the whatever the system init process
is.  I should mention that if you do use a distro that uses upstart or
systemd, then they both support a native interface for setting rlimits:
http://upstart.ubuntu.com/wiki/Stanzas#limit and
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html
(search in-page for setrlimit).

&gt; It would  be nice to  just wrap  a script in  a PAM service.   Do such
&gt; wrappers  exist?  Or are  they too  much of  a security  nightmare?  I
&gt; suspect I'll end up adding pam_limits to /etc/pam.d/su , unless that's
&gt; also a security no-no.

Plenty of scripting languages provide bindings to the PAM library, I
don't know of any tools written expressly for doing PAM authorization
from shell scripts off the top of my head.  Again, the reason I said
don't use su isn't because it's bad to configure su to use pam_limits,
that's fine; I say don't use su becuase it's interface isn't
consistent between implementations and doing so means your script
will be fragile.
