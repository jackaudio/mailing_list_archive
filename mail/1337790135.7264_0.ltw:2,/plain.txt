I use set_rlimits[1] for this:

    su user -c '/usr/sbin/set_rlimits jackd ..'

The set_rlimits configuration file is much like that of sudo: you can
specify which users or groups can run which commands with which mem
lock and rt priority limits. It's the simplest solution I know of, and
even works on my PAM-less Slackware boxes. For a typical workstation
environment, I start both jackd and the window manager's task bar with
it, so that any JACK client apps the user starts also have the needed
privileges.

HTH,

-Sean
