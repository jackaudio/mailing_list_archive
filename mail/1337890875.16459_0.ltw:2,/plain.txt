Hi Steve,

Great to hear you're willing to give it a shot at getting it going.  It would
be good to have wineasio be cross-platform.  A 64-bit build would be good too...

If you have a poke around on the SourceForge project, you'll find several
different versions of the code and in the SVN tree they're pretty neatly laid
out.  This does, IIRC, include different approaches to locking.  I think that's
also one of the things jhernberg was looking at in his refactoring.

I'm hoping Real Life (tm) will at some point give me time to spend catching up
with where we are on wineasio/JackWASIO/JackRouter (which is the native Windows
ASIO to JACK driver).  I'm so out of the loop, I can't do much more than watch
the project at the moment!

Thanks,

-- Peter

I tried messing around with the code a bit for an evening to see if I could enable more outputs, not really knowing what I was doing in terms of ASIO or Jack programming, and I was able to get more outputs to show up under one app, but not under Reaper, I don't know, something was missing obviously.  The code in JackWASIO was obviously hacked together in a way to get it working fast, its not very well organized code, I found a few things that didn't make sense to me, when comparing it with the wineasio code.  But I really have to learn more about the ASIO and jackd SDK's before I an tackle this.

I read somewhere from the author of JackWASIO that the main problem with it before was the use of semaphores or shared memory or some such thing, which was a conflict between linux and BSD.  Something like that.  Its been a few years since I read it, I can't remember now what it was.  Wineasio has been refactored since then, so perhaps it can now be made to work on OSX too.

It would really be a lot better for the OSX community if we can somehow benefit from that ongoing progress instead of just using this 4 year old JackWASIO code that nobody is interested in improving(except perhaps me).

Just poking around in wineasio and JackWASIO, I can see that wineasio has been refactored a lot to use Jack's SDK differently.  I have to learn more to understand why or how its different.

I get the feeling this is a common wine development issue, but I can't be sure.  Its something I don't really understand (yet), but whatever they did in wineasio is not compatible with the OSX compiler/assember (which is not ELF).   When I get some time my next step will be to compare the COM assembler injections in JackWASIO and I'll try to bring that back to wineasio to see if I can get it to work, but maybe one of you guys knows helpful info.
