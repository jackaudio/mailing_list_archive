To narrow down the problem: given that I run jackd for weeks/months, I
don't think it's inside jackd. Or even if so, it depends on the
soundcard in use.

Can you confirm or deny that it is related to jack, IOW, is pure ALSO
also affected?

There's also /proc/asound/card?/pcm*/sub*/status that might give you
some hints, e.g., problems with the hw pointer.
