JACK routinely runs on my machine for periods of days and occasionally
weeks, with absolutely no change in the likelihood of an xrun. There is no
inherent issue with the wraparound of the 32 bit frame count value in JACK
itself.

It is increasingly frustrating to see people with latency/xrun issues with
JACK on their systems look to JACK as the source of the issue(s). We need
an article describing how to do kernel level debugging to find the
source(s) of latency so that we can definitively point people there. Maybe
it already exists?
