Sure, but jackd is not to blame if the underlying kernel driver comes up
with an insane hw pointer. pulseaudio would probably also be disturbed.

As Paul said, people run jackd for weeks, and I've never heard of your

I even have three, one for each audio device. Do you use ALSA at all?
Maybe you're on OSS instead? Does /proc/asound/cards look like you're on
ALSA?
