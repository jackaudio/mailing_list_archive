at least I've been running into a similar issue but on a much shorter 
timescale. At lower latencies (anything that get's below a total buffer 
length of 512 frames) my system starts spitting out xruns after a minute 
or so. Again without any client connected.

While I guess that it's a driver issue (snd-usb-audio/M-Audio Fast Track 
Ultra) it's at least irritating to see that running Takashi's "latency" 
test utility will yield way better possible latencies than I can get 
with jack without any client.

So, as Paul said,  "we need an article describing how to do kernel level 
debugging to find the source(s) of latency".

Regards,

Felix
