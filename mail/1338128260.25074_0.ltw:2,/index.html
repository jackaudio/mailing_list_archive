&gt; I can confirm that this behaviour does occur on my system with the same
&gt; sound card.
&gt; 
&gt; It was running at 96kHz and I wasn't timing it accurately, but jackd
&gt; was running perfectly until about 6hr 13min after starting, when it suddenly
&gt; started behaving as described at the start of this thread. That would
&gt; tie in with the above numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow if I get time I'll run the same test with one of my Delta 1010s
&gt; which are also ice1712 based.

The Delta 1010 exhibits the same behaviour. In the past I have run it for
longer than this without the problem occurring. Unfortunately that was a
long time ago (c. 2007) and many changes have been made in the kernel,
ALSA and other software since then. I hadn't encountered this problem
in the meantime as I don't usually run jackd for more than about 8 hours
at a time and stick to 44.1 or 48kHz sample rate.

The fact that people are running jackd for long periods without a problem
with other hardware would suggest that it isn't jackd that's at fault. If
it's a hardware bug it's one which is triggered by some software change
made in the last few years.

Current software here:
Debian testing amd64 (pre multi-arch snapshot)
Standard kernel.org 3.2.16 SMP PREEMPT x86_64 kernel with HZ=1000
alsa-driver-1.0.24, alsa-lib-1.0.24.1
jack 0.121.3

I have an old Debian 5.0 based DAW system on a spare HDD which I'll test
next.
