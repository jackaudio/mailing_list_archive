Really?   What is  it  then?  It  certainly  *looks* like  a map  from
users/groups to resource  limits.  And I don't see  anything else in a
PAM-based system that makes  that association.  That's close enough to
a "single control  point of what resource limits  any process of given
user or group has" for me!

If  I  configure su,  sudo,  sshd and  similar  services  to call  the
pam_limits module then surely that *does* make it so!

Anyway, I added pam_limits to /etc/pam.d/su and it just works, so I am
running with that for now.

Thanks for the discussion though, it was very interesting.
