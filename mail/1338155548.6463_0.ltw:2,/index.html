&gt; The Delta 1010 exhibits the same behaviour. In the past I have run it for
&gt; longer than this without the problem occurring. Unfortunately that was a
&gt; long time ago (c. 2007) and many changes have been made in the kernel,
&gt; ALSA and other software since then. I hadn't encountered this problem
&gt; in the meantime as I don't usually run jackd for more than about 8 hours
&gt; at a time and stick to 44.1 or 48kHz sample rate.
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that people are running jackd for long periods without a problem
&gt; with other hardware would suggest that it isn't jackd that's at fault. If
&gt; it's a hardware bug it's one which is triggered by some software change
&gt; made in the last few years.
&gt; 
&gt; Current software here:
&gt; Debian testing amd64 (pre multi-arch snapshot)
&gt; Standard kernel.org 3.2.16 SMP PREEMPT x86_64 kernel with HZ=1000
&gt; alsa-driver-1.0.24, alsa-lib-1.0.24.1
&gt; jack 0.121.3
&gt; 
&gt; I have an old Debian 5.0 based DAW system on a spare HDD which I'll test
&gt; next.

The problem also occurs with the earlier software:

Debian 5.0.3 amd64
2.6.29 SMP PREEMPT x86_64 kernel, HZ=1000
alsa-driver-1.0.18a, alsa-lib-1.0.18
jack 0.116.1
