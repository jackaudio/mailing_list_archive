Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics error with Jack PortAudio on Windows 7 64 bit

I don't see anything special in the log. 

- have you tried any other audio application?

- have you tried with one other audio card?

> Thanks. I don't get that error anymore, but I still can't get any playback at all. My audio player sees the JackRouter device, and when I hit "play", Jack PortAudio's console reacts to this event (in verbose mode), but after 10 seconds my audio player gives a "Timeout" error (and Jack PortAudio's console reacts to this again).

>>> Hello,
>>> 
>>> I have a problem when I run Jack PortAudio on Windows 7 64bit: the console repeats the message "AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics error : 1552" infinitely. I have installed ASIO4ALL and my audio player (foobar2000) sees the Jack audio driver, but the playback only works for a quarter of second, then I get a timeout error. The commandline I'm using to launch Jack PortAudio is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2". I'm using an onboard Realtek ALC889. I have also tried using the package intended for 32-bit OSes; the error remains the same, only the number at the end changes (5 instead of 1552).
