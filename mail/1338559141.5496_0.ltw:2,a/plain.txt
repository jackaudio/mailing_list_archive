just a quick re: the line-numbers refered to git-head
  https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/
currently 007cdc37142a

It looks like it is indeed caused by using unions to check for /true/.
  "if ([bool/int/..]union) -> always true"

But I'm at a loss what'd cause those issues and how to best fix it.
Maybe someone else can take it from here. It should be sufficient info
to file a bug report at  https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/issues

best,
robin
