both. arch (downstream) is pushing recently released (upstream)
compiler. jack control api implementaiton triggers the bug. its not
issue in jack itself but its still problem for jack users.

YMMV. Default compiler in my distro (Gentoo) works properly. jack also
"works", until you find that it misbehaves. You can only be sure if you
have tests that cover 100% of the code. Neither jack1 nor jack2 have
such.
