Subject:     [Jack-Devel] adjusting default settings installed in ubuntu studio

hello,

i would like to change the default jack settings when ubuntu studio is
installed. this would mean either adjusting the jackd package in the ubuntu
repository or creating a new package that would be included within the
ubuntu studio image.

can someone provide some feedback on how this could be effected in relation
to jackd? i.e. what file should be changed or what file should created and
where?

i think i can handle the ubuntu repository/packaging bit.

cheers,
scottl
