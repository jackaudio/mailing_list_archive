&gt; Harry, I am quite capable of adjusting the setting for my computer.

Aha, sorry for misunderstanding.

I presume you're aware that each card has different properties as to what  
it likes: my Intel HDA runs a lot better at 48k, 2, 256 than 44k, 3, 128  
for example. It will be very difficult to reach a decent compromise for all  
the different cards, that doesn't caus xruns on the worse ones.

So you'll need to install a .jackdrc file in the users home directory: it  
contains the startup command for jackd. I'm currently running an RME  
Multiface II like so:
/usr/bin/jackd -P89 -p512 -t1000 -dalsa -dhw:1 -r48000 -p256 -n2 -Xseq

Although its a great idea to try improve performance and latency, I think  
it will be very hard to achive something that is reliable over many  
different cards. There have been efforts made by the community to script  
tests that would determine the best settings per card: although the tests  
work AFAIK the results were not conclusive, and some manual user  
exploration was needed anyway. I don't have a link to that effort here, but  
I'm sure somebody from the community will chime in.

Please report back what your intended new settings are, perhaps I can test  
those settings on the soundcards I have here and inform you of how it runs.
Good luck, -Harry
