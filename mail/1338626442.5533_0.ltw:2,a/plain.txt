For desktop integration, I suggest to

create /etc/skel/.config/rncbc.org/QjackCtl.conf
add a few common presets for 44.1k, 48k, different HW settings: low- and
high-latency. Enable qjackctl's start-server-on-application-start
setting and also include /etc/skel/.config/autostart/qjackctl.desktop

As others pointed out deciding on /good/ defaults will be a hard - if
not impossible - task.
