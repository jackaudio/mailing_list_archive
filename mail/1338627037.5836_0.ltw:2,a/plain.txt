Neat, probably the right approach to the question, since it doesn't
require compiling the package as long as the default config is provided
in a separate settings package.

I was about to suggest patching src/qjackctlSetup.cpp, that's what we
did in Debian for years, but we no longer see the need.

Indeed. A dialogue would be more appropriate: start with some
conservative settings, prompt the user if he hears sound, if there is
stutter or not. Depending on his answer(s), choose different settings or
complete the setup.

I don't know if it's worth the effort.
