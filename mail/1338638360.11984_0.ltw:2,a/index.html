Hi Dominic

&gt; I am on Ubuntu 12.04 newest acne of ffado compiled fine.  Then I went to
&gt; compile jack and during make process I get an error saying that
&gt; libjack.lais not a valid libtool achieve.

I must admit that I haven't seen the .lais extension before, but judging
from the context it seems like it might be something created and/or used by
a newer autoconf libtool than I'm accustomed to.

In any case, it seems that this particular error is related to the building
of jackd on your system: the error occurs while compiling jackd, it relates
to libjack, and you said that FFADO itself compiled and installed without
incident.  It therefore seems that at this stage it is more appropriate to
raise this issue on the jack-devel mailing list.

About the only thing I can suggest is that maybe you have a previous version
of jack installed already and that this is somehow confusing libtool.  This
seems unlikely though, given the specific error you're reporting.

&gt; Has anyone seen this before?

For completeness, I have not.

Regards
  jonathan
