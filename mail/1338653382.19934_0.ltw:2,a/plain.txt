This guesswork fails. libdbus doesnt do this if only because it uses
dbus_bool_t and not C99 nor C++ bool. OTOH this is quickly becomming
offtopic and dbus-fud-y. The problem is the incorrect machine code
generated by gcc-4.7.0. That code is not in libdbus, its produced from
JackControlAPI.cpp in the jack2 source tree. You can prove the bug by
disassemling the jackctl_server_create function. The call for adding the
verbose parameter doesnt update the stack variable called "value" which
is set just before the call, line 667. If someone can explain why this
is invalid C code, please do it. If someone cares to produce an isolated
test case please do it and then report upstream (gcc). In the latter
case we can at least expect some gcc guru to decide if its a gcc bug or
invalid C code.
