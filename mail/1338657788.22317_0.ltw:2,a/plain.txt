It some software implements its own boolean type, and then in
some cases decides that a given value of that type is neither
true nor false - as you wrote in a previous post - then that
is a bug. The essence of a boolean is that it always either
true or false. My suspicion is based on what you wrote, nothing
else.

Showing that the compiler does the right thing with booleans
(which is what my simple example code does) is not offtopic
in this context. And formulating a working hypothesis based
on that and previous evidence (see above) is not FUD.
