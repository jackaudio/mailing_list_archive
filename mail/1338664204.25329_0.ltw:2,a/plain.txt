Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Having touble building new Jack 121.3

Ok so I solved build for 1.9.8 but not for 121.3.  I pulled down 1.9.8 from
git repo on the site.  I did ./waf configure --prefix=usr --firewire --alsa
and was able to config.  Then I did ./waf build it then complained that
svnversion.h is not a directory.  It was not.  So I created the directory
svnversion.h and then it built.  Was that meant to be left out in the git
version?  Did sudo ./waf install and installed fine.  git version is the
only one that works against newest ffado build that is why I used it.

What is svnversion.h?  Is it supposed to be automatically created on build?

Thanks,

Dominic
