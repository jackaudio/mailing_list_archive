100% code coverage in tests does not guarantee all bugs are found. You 
also need to test 100% of all possible input/output pairs.. Example: I 
have a function that calculates some mathematical function and has a 
conditional branch somewhere in it. Now I write two tests (one 
input/output pair each to compare against) to cover both cases of the 
conditional. Does that guarantee to me that the code works for ALL 
inputs? No, not at all. Only reasoning (a.k.a. a proof) will give you 
that...
