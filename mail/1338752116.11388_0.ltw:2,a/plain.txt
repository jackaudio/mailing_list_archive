Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack is installed having a new problem

I have run into a new issue.  I have installed built and installed jack2
from git.  The reason being I have an RME interface that needs a newer
version of FFADO. And the only version that builds against it is the git
version.  So I still cannot buid jack1 I am working on that.  I am running
Ubuntu 12.04.  I have installed the packaged from repo for jack2 and
installed over them with the new jack build from git.  PREFIX=/usr or
install path.  To many dependencies to uninstall the the libjack package.
 I have done this plenty in the past and had no issues.  This time around I
have only one at the moment.  I have an internal sound card in my dell
latitude e6400 laptop it fires up fine with jack2.  I use a usb sound card
also which in the past has been fine no problems.  But since this new build
this card does not fire up in jack or qjackctl.  It shows fine on my system
jack shoots this error as standard user:

No problem running.

I have checked for multiple installs that is ruled out.  I have checked
sticky bit for executing as owner good.  I am guessing it has something to
do with that policy error.  USB Card has access and correct permissions and
works with alsa in Ubuntu fine.  My problem is with Jack.  I have never had
this before when doing the same type of install in Ubuntu
10.04,10.10,11.04,11.11 so mabey an issue in 12.04?  FFADO and Firewire is
fine and I am using there svn version for my RME Fireface 800.

Let me know what you think,

Dominic
