This is just wrong.

You don't even have to recompile jackd to use a new FFADO version.

You can safely go back to your distro's jackd package (install it) and
then do a *fresh* build of FFADO, that is, delete the entire directory
or at least rm -rf cache/ .scons*

scons will detect that you're using an "old" version of jackd and
doesn't activate the code that requires the "new" jackd.

You can even override this auto-detection and force scons to use
whatever you want:

   scons ENABLE_SETBUFFERSIZE_API_VER=false

You did not:

This is the packaged jackd, the git version would have presented 1.9.9.

BTW, setting --prefix=/usr ist not enough anymore, Ubuntu uses
multiarch now, so libs go to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu or whatever
platform you use.

Stick to the packaged version of jackd and file a bug report against
Ubuntu in case something doesn't work.
