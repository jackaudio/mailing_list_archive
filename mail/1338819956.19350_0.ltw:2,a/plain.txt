Subject:     [Jack-Devel] how you can love JACK back

its fairly clear that neither myself nor stephane are going to find the
time on any foreseeable timeline to do the complete review+merge of the
JACK headers that has been proposed to ease *some* of the issues
surrounding future JACK development.

however, that doesn't mean that it can't happen. i know that i can review
material far faster if its in the "right" format. my guess that the same is
true for stephane as well.

so here is a proposal/request for help from the JACK community to ensure
that this gets done. you don't need to be a coder (though you do need to be
able to read code).

what we need is a breakout of all the functions defined in the header files
that get installed by jack1 and jack2. the result should be, preferably, a
side-by-side (literally) juxtaposition of the comments/docs for each
function, and the declaration of the function. This is mostly a text
editing task, in fact, with a need for good presentation. The result should
be something that is easy to go through and review the differences. In a
few cases, there will be a function that exists in only one version.

remember: you don't need to be any kind of uber-coder, or even a coder at
all, to help with this incredibly valuable task. you just need to be able
read header files, find stuff in two parallel (and different) trees of
header files, and collate what you find into some format that we can easily
review.

please step up :)
