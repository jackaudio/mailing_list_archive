&gt; its fairly clear that neither myself nor stephane are going to find the

&gt; JACK headers that has been proposed to ease *some* of the issues

&gt; 
&gt; however, that doesn't mean that it can't happen. i know that i can review
&gt; material far faster if its in the "right" format. my guess that the same is
&gt; true for stephane as well.
&gt; 
&gt; so here is a proposal/request for help from the JACK community to ensure
&gt; that this gets done. you don't need to be a coder (though you do need to be
&gt; able to read code).
&gt; 
&gt; what we need is a breakout of all the functions defined in the header files
&gt; that get installed by jack1 and jack2. the result should be, preferably, a
&gt; side-by-side (literally) juxtaposition of the comments/docs for each
&gt; function, and the declaration of the function. This is mostly a text
&gt; editing task, in fact, with a need for good presentation. The result should
&gt; be something that is easy to go through and review the differences. In a
&gt; few cases, there will be a function that exists in only one version.
&gt; 
&gt; remember: you don't need to be any kind of uber-coder, or even a coder at
&gt; all, to help with this incredibly valuable task. you just need to be able
&gt; read header files, find stuff in two parallel (and different) trees of
&gt; header files, and collate what you find into some format that we can easily
&gt; review.
&gt; 
&gt; please step up :)

just to be clear:

You're asking for an annotated side-by-side diff between:

https://github.com/jackaudio/headers
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/tree/master/common/jack

is that correct?

I suppose you can use github to create that. github will also allow to
comment on the diff.

Here's a proposal that should be fairly quick to implement:

 1) clone/import
    https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/tree/master/common/jack
   as a branch to https://github.com/jackaudio/headers

 2) NOOP-edit that branch: re-order fn, add/remove whitespace to make
   jack2 headers as similar as possible to unmodified jackaudio/headers

 3) use github create the side-by-side diff

 4) comment on the github diff.

thoughts?
