just to be clear:

You're asking for an annotated side-by-side diff between:

https://github.com/jackaudio/headers
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/tree/master/common/jack

is that correct?

I suppose you can use github to create that. github will also allow to
comment on the diff.

Here's a proposal that should be fairly quick to implement:

 1) clone/import
    https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/tree/master/common/jack
   as a branch to https://github.com/jackaudio/headers

 2) NOOP-edit that branch: re-order fn, add/remove whitespace to make
   jack2 headers as similar as possible to unmodified jackaudio/headers

 3) use github create the side-by-side diff

 4) comment on the github diff.

thoughts?
