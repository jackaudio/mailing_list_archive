&gt; &gt; its fairly clear that neither myself nor stephane are going to find the

&gt; &gt; surrounding future JACK development.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; however, that doesn't mean that it can't happen. i know that i can review
&gt; &gt; material far faster if its in the "right" format. my guess that the same
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; true for stephane as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so here is a proposal/request for help from the JACK community to ensure
&gt; &gt; that this gets done. you don't need to be a coder (though you do need to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; able to read code).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; what we need is a breakout of all the functions defined in the header
&gt; files
&gt; &gt; that get installed by jack1 and jack2. the result should be, preferably,
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; side-by-side (literally) juxtaposition of the comments/docs for each
&gt; &gt; function, and the declaration of the function. This is mostly a text
&gt; &gt; editing task, in fact, with a need for good presentation. The result
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; be something that is easy to go through and review the differences. In a
&gt; &gt; few cases, there will be a function that exists in only one version.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; remember: you don't need to be any kind of uber-coder, or even a coder at
&gt; &gt; all, to help with this incredibly valuable task. you just need to be able
&gt; &gt; read header files, find stuff in two parallel (and different) trees of
&gt; &gt; header files, and collate what you find into some format that we can
&gt; easily
&gt; &gt; review.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; please step up :)
&gt;
&gt; just to be clear:
&gt;
&gt; You're asking for an annotated side-by-side diff between:
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/headers
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/tree/master/common/jack
&gt;
&gt; is that correct?
&gt;
&gt; I suppose you can use github to create that. github will also allow to
&gt; comment on the diff.
&gt;
&gt; Here's a proposal that should be fairly quick to implement:
&gt;
&gt;  1) clone/import
&gt;    https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/tree/master/common/jack
&gt;   as a branch to https://github.com/jackaudio/headers
&gt;
&gt;  2) NOOP-edit that branch: re-order fn, add/remove whitespace to make
&gt;   jack2 headers as similar as possible to unmodified jackaudio/headers
&gt;
&gt;  3) use github create the side-by-side diff
&gt;
&gt;  4) comment on the github diff.
&gt;

that all seems correct to me.
