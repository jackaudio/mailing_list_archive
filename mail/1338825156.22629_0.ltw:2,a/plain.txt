There is already branch for this, with headers submodule set for jack2:

https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/tree/submodules

In this jack2 branch, the jack2-headers are in /common/jack2-headers/
while the shared ones that need to be fixed are in /common/jack/

The last and only diverged commit in the branch is the one that switches
the headers and make jack2 source not build (because they are in fact
jack1 headers slightly stripped).
