Hi all,

I'm willing to contribute some time to this. I've pulled code a la Robin's
suggestion, and have "Meld" doing the dirty work: it compares similar files
and graphically shows the changes.

I've a little situation: what if the documentation is different for a
function?

Eg Jack1:
/* &lt;b&gt;THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN
 *  NEW JACK CLIENTS&lt;/b&gt;
*/

Jack2:
/* \bold THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN
*  NEW JACK CLIENTS
*
* @deprecated Please use jack_client_open().
*/

I'm not very familiar with doxygen tags etc, but it seems nice to tag the
function as deprecated and point to _open?

Do we edit the JACK1 file, or how do we want to merge these?

Cheers, -Harry

&gt; its fairly clear that neither myself nor stephane are going to find the
&gt; time on any foreseeable timeline to do the complete review+merge of the
&gt; JACK headers that has been proposed to ease *some* of the issues
&gt; surrounding future JACK development.
&gt;
&gt; however, that doesn't mean that it can't happen. i know that i can review
&gt; material far faster if its in the "right" format. my guess that the same is
&gt; true for stephane as well.
&gt;
&gt; so here is a proposal/request for help from the JACK community to ensure
&gt; that this gets done. you don't need to be a coder (though you do need to be
&gt; able to read code).
&gt;
&gt; what we need is a breakout of all the functions defined in the header
&gt; files that get installed by jack1 and jack2. the result should be,
&gt; preferably, a side-by-side (literally) juxtaposition of the comments/docs
&gt; for each function, and the declaration of the function. This is mostly a
&gt; text editing task, in fact, with a need for good presentation. The result
&gt; should be something that is easy to go through and review the differences.
&gt; In a few cases, there will be a function that exists in only one version.
&gt;
&gt; remember: you don't need to be any kind of uber-coder, or even a coder at
&gt; all, to help with this incredibly valuable task. you just need to be able
&gt; read header files, find stuff in two parallel (and different) trees of
&gt; header files, and collate what you find into some format that we can easily
&gt; review.
&gt;
&gt; please step up :)
