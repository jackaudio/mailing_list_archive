Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] how you can love JACK back

Hi all,

I'm willing to contribute some time to this. I've pulled code a la Robin's
suggestion, and have "Meld" doing the dirty work: it compares similar files
and graphically shows the changes.

I've a little situation: what if the documentation is different for a
function?

Eg Jack1:
/* <b>THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN
 *  NEW JACK CLIENTS</b>
*/

Jack2:
/* \bold THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN
*  NEW JACK CLIENTS
*
* @deprecated Please use jack_client_open().
*/

I'm not very familiar with doxygen tags etc, but it seems nice to tag the
function as deprecated and point to _open?

Do we edit the JACK1 file, or how do we want to merge these?

Cheers, -Harry
