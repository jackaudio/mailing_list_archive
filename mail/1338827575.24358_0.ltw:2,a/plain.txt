Ok: but what's the point in looking at everything twice??

For the sake of easy documentation like above I feel confident enough to
know what to do.

When things get more complicated, perhaps I can post to list? There's some
threading comments added to Jack2 headers and I don't know exactly what to
do with them.


Workflow suggestion:
-I'll work away, when things are obvious (like adding @deprecated tags etc)
I'll just do it
-When things are hard, I'll keep them in a seperate commit in git, and post
a link to the list pointing to that commit's diff, and we can discuss the
issue using Github comment features?

Could this be a good workflow? -Harry
