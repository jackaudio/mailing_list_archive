it could be. the goal is to end up with a single set of headers that will
be accepted as *the* headers for JACK, definitively defining the API, and
shared by any implementation. this means that if you make any changes that
are even a teensy-weensy bit controversial, it will make the later adoption
a bit harder. other than that, go for it!
