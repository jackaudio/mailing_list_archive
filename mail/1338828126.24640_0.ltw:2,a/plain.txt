I don't think meld is a good choice here. You don't want to merge
anything. git's colored diff and a regexp editor will be your best
friend here.

We are :)

let me try some answers:

Remove all the trailing whitespace from jack1's header-files. Trailing
white-space is ugly. jack2 has removed most of them already.
  %s/  *$//g

use 8-space tab-stops throughout the code and a shift-width of 8.
jack1's headers are pretty consistent WRT to that, jack2's header are not.

\bold is correct for doxygen. Many of the doxygen comments in jack2 have
fixed typos and doxygen syntax-errors (e.g. @a references) in the jack1
headers.

I suggest to fix the doxygen-syntax and remove duplicate whitespace, but
retain other typos and differences in the comments as they are for now.

2c,
robin
