Does "working for me" mean that verbose is not enabled by default anymore?

The verbose parameter is not driver parameter, so it should not
be affected by this code at all.

My reading of the C++ standard is that the implicit conversion is
valid. C++11, section 4.12 states:

"A prvalue of arithmetic, unscoped enumeration, pointer, or pointer to
member type can be converted to a prvalue of type bool. A zero value,
null pointer value, or null member pointer value is converted to false;
any other value is converted to true. A prvalue of type std::nullptr_t
can be converted to a prvalue of type bool; the resulting value is
false."

Of course, explicit conversion is valid as well. I still claim that the
generated code for jackctl_add_parameter() calls for "temporary" and
"verbose" engine parameters is wrong because it pushes union
jackctl_parameter_value with value of 10 (for both bool and integer
members) while it should push false/0. both 1 and 10 are true, not
false. the default value for both parameters is false.
