Going via git was not that bad after all. At least it's a good
intermediate state. Attached side-by-side diff assumes you have a wide
enough screen to display 200 characters per line and use 8 spaces/tab.

Now, would someone know a suitable Wiki, code-annotation site or similar
that can render this diff nicely and allow discussion?



To re-create:

  git clone git://github.com/x42/headers.git jack-headers
  cd jack-headers
  git checkout -b cmp_jack1 origin/cmp_jack1
  git checkout -b cmp_jack2 origin/cmp_jack2
  # git diff cmp_jack1...cmp_jack2

  git difftool -y --extcmd='diff -y -W 200 ' cmp_jack1..cmp_jack2 \
  > jack_header_compare.txt


Now edit jack_header_compare.txt and remove all irrelevant lines :)
That's actually only a 5-10 min task and reduced the diff from 4974 to
951 lines (633 if you also remove the new net.h file).

  * remove changes in comments and documentation when the function
    definition is identical.
  * remove NOOPs (added variable-names); e.g.
    -int jack_set_port_connect_callback (jack_client_t *,
    +int jack_set_port_connect_callback (jack_client_t *client,
  * remove jack_position_t - the definition is identical, but the
    coding and indent style is different.

Note: Lines are cut short after 100 chars. This only affects the net.h
header which was introduced in jack2 and a single line in transport.h
that I've line-wrapped manually: "#define JACK_POSITION_MASK ..."


have fun,
robin
