if there's a reason to switch, the thing to switch to is a semaphore, or
even a raw futex. there's no justification for switching to pthread
synchronization objects. there is some evidence that at this point in time,
semaphores are faster. the synchronization via FIFOs does not happen via
read/write syscalls, but via poll(2) and write(2). the reads just empty the
FIFO and are not related to sync.
