posix fifos and posix semaphores are equally portable, which is to say, not
100%. moreover, on some posix OS's (e.g. OS X), posix synchronization APIs
are notably slower than using lower level primitives such as Mach
semaphores. the same observation applies to Linux, where futexes are faster
than pthread cond vars.
