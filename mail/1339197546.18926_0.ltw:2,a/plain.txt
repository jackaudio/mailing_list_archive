Try this instead:

    if (v2.b) return 1;
    return 0;

Here this makes main return 10. (incorrect)
If i change 0 to 2, main returns 1. (incorrect)

If you are are really curious, change 10 in the original test to
9. However, this trick doesnt workaround the original issue. fc17
changes default realtime-priority from 10 to 60. Changing the default to
61 doesnt workaround the code generated for jack.
