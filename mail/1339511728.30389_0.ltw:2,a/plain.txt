Subject:     [Jack-Devel] MIDI support for OpenBSD?

Hi,

I am an electronics hobbyist and I am currently building a MIDI capable
instrument based on a YM2612 (just for  fun).

Having built the majority of the instrument, I started looking for a
sequencer I could use. Most of my systems run OpenBSD. Finding a
sequencer that was easily portable was a challenge (most are linux
specific, depending upon ALSA). I have a port of non-sequencer:
http://non-sequencer.tuxfamily.org/

This sequencer uses Jack for MIDI.

I also have my eye on seq24, but this is *really* tied to linux via ALSA, so I
am dismissing this for now.

Just when I thought I was all set, I realisd that Jack does not support MIDI on
OpenBSD.

OpenBSD uses a raw midi implementation via /dev/rmidi* device nodes. There is a
manual page detailing this here:
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=midi&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&arch=i386&format=html

Is there any plan to add jack midi support for OpenBSD?

I must admit I am very new to midi, so I can not make a judgement as to how much
effort adding this support would be. It *may* be fairly similar to the raw alsa
implementation you already have (?).

Cheers
