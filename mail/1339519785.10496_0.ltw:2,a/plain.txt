Subject:     [Jack-Devel] gcc-4.1 support

Hi,

Apologies if this has been hashed out already.

I would like to know if there is a specific reason that jack no longer
compiles under gcc-4.1. This affects specifically users of debian etch
based derivatives and creates a substantial amount of pain in the case of
upgrading to > gcc-4.1.

I have looked at the proposed solution of adding

#define __USE_UNIX98

in certain headers that reference pthread.h but that doesn't get past the
issue for me or others who have tried.

If it is just that no one had time to do the work around then it would be
very helpful for me and no doubt many others who are still reliant on
solutions built on top of etch to have an official patch which we can
manually apply if there is not time to fully integrate a fix to main
trunk.

I had no trouble upgrading to latest alsa on the same machine so the only
thing holding me back is a new version of jack. It would significantly
extend the life of some machines that are currently installed around the
world in varying professional and educational settings.
