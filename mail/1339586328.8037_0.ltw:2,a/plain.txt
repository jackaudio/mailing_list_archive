Betreff: [Jack-Devel] WG: A lot of Xrun Callbacks ... really xruns?

Hello,

in the meantime I did a lot of tests, but didn't get any further...

Sometimes, I start my system and these xrun callbacks happen 3 times every second.
Sometimes, I restart the system, and no xruns are reported to my client.

Are there any hints?

Regards,
Mathias

Betreff: [Jack-Devel] A lot of Xrun Callbacks ... really xruns?

Hello list,

in my system, running jackdmp 1.9.8, I encounter some (rare) hearable xruns during certain moments.
To get a better knowledge of WHEN the Xruns occur, I implemented a jack client, which implements the xrun_callback.

Now, I can see that callback gets called, something about every 3 seconds, in a very periodical way.

As I can't hear that xruns, I tried to implement "jack_get_xrun_delayed_usecs()", but that always returns with "0.0". (I thought, I read somewhere, that this statistics may not be very useful with jack2. Is there any other way, to get a knowledge about the strength of an xrun?

The second question is: Are these xruns really happening?
Jack log says: "Jack: ALSA XRun wait_status = 0" every time, the xrun callback is happening (when being started with -v)
On the other hand, when I get these really hearable xruns, jack log says something about "graph error" ... but xrun callback is still the same.

I don't know, if that does matter, but I start jack in soft-mode (using -s)... ?

Regards,
Mathias
