Hi,

I've been using FreeBSD exclusivly for USB MIDI since v8.0, and the ping time 
on MIDI using a graphical userland application is less than 6 milliseconds for 
one command looped back. What timings are you seeing?

Please also note there is now a dedicated USB MIDI driver in FreeBSD 8+ which 
talks RAW MIDI.
