Hi,

If sending out MIDI data real fast and accurately is important, you should 
never use Windows I know. It's MIDI system seems not capable of sending more 
than one MIDI command per millisecond at FULL speed USB, because they don't 
take full advantage of the USB MIDI specification. Some hardware manufacturers 
then won't decode more than one MIDI command per ms either, because they think 
this feature in USB MIDI is not used at all, and that's why we have the 
"UQ_SINGLE_CMD_MIDI" quirk in FreeBSD.
