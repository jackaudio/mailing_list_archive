Almost nobody does direct measurements of the MIDI signal lines due to
the hardware required.  It's easier to measure ping times using a looped
back MIDI cable, which should give the same results, and there is a tool
for that:
<https://github.com/koppi/alsa-midi-latency-test>

All the reported benchmark results are below 6 ms.

(The primary purpose is not so much measuring the hardware but the
kernel's maximum scheduling delay.  The UM-2EX results were done on
a very optimized kernel.)

While this program uses the ALSA sequencer API at the moment, it doesn't
require any features that would prevent it to be ported to use raw MIDI.
