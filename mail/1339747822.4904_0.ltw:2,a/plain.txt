Subject:     [Jack-Devel] ALSA merged audio device:

This is my first post to this list -- thanks in advance for advice.

I'm trying to configure Jack 1.9.6 on Ubuntu 10.04 (with real-time kernel) to
use all four channels of an M-Audio fast track pro. The class-compliant USB
audio driver reads a pair of stereo devices:

card 1: Pro [FastTrack Pro], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 0/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: Pro [FastTrack Pro], device 1: USB Audio [USB Audio #1]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

I've set up a merged device in .asoundrc and tested directly against alsa, no
problem:

1. Play a stereo, 44.1 kHz, 16 bit file to hw:1,0.
2. Play the same file to hw:1,1.
3. Use SuperCollider to make a four channel version of the same file, and play
this to the merged device.

All of these tests are successful -- so I think the .asoundrc configuration is
correct.

Jack can use either of the stereo devices -- hw:1,0 or hw:1,1 -- for playback
with no problem. I've been using that successfully for almost two years now.

But... (-Chw:1,1 is for the FTPro's stereo input)

/usr/bin/jackd -S -P60 -dalsa -r44100 -p1024 -n2 -D -Chw:1,1 -Pft4 -s

... gives me:

Any ideas what I'm missing?

Thanks,
