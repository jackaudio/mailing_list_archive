When compiling it, I get:
gcc -Wall -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112 -std=c99 -O3 -o jack-dl jack-dl.c
c-common/lib-c-common.a -ljack -lpthread -lm -ldl -llo gcc:
c-common/lib-c-common.a: No such file or directory jack-dl.c:13:32:
fatal error: c-common/jack-port.h: No such file or directory

It look like something is missing, or the Makefile is screwed. And it
is no Makefile.am or autogen script any more.

Ciao,
Dominique
