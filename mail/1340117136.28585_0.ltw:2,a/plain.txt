Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] A lot of Xrun Callbacks ... really xruns?

Hello,

in the meantime, i did some cyclictest with the kernel ... but i do not think, the issue is somewhere there (audio plays fine, as i don't hear any oft hat xruns).

Cyclictest reports:
/tmp/cyclictest -a -t -n -p99
# /dev/cpu_dma_latency set to 0us
policy: fifo: loadavg: 4.82 5.10 5.01 2/892 2435

T: 0 ( 2434) P:99 I:1000 C:  62916 Min:     12 Act:   22 Avg:   28 Max:     310
T: 1 ( 2435) P:99 I:1500 C:  41944 Min:     13 Act:   19 Avg:   31 Max:     298

Anyway ... I just start jackd ... and after a while, I count the xrun_callback in a jack_client.
After 3 Minutes of running jackd (without any audio playing) I got already 500 xruns reported.

Jackd log says a lot of:
Jack: fPollTable i = 1 fd = 10
Jack: JackRequest::Notification
Jack: JackEngine::NotifyClient: no callback for event = 3
Jack: ALSA XRun wait_status = 0
Jack: JackEngine::NotifyClient: no callback for event = 3
Jack: JackEngine::NotifyClient: no callback for event = 3
Jack: fPollTable i = 2 fd = 11

I also enabled
                echo 3 > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/xrun_debug
for all the cards, but that does not report ANY single xrun.

I also tried to start with -P to disable "capture" ... but that does not change anything.

Any hints?

Regards,
Mathias

Hello,

in the meantime I did a lot of tests, but didn't get any further...
Sometimes, I start my system and these xrun callbacks happen 3 times every second.
Sometimes, I restart the system, and no xruns are reported to my client.

Are there any hints?


you should by using the cyclic latency test (google it). forget JACK for the time being and focus on the kernel's own latency testing tools.
