Hello,

It's a TDM ALSA driver, with 4 buffers ... so 4 must be correct...
I am more wondering, that ALSA does not report the xruns with xrun_debug, but jackd does ...

All the real xruns (which I can hear) are logged by jack with "graph error ... was not run" ...
But these periodic xruns, reported by jack are just logged with "xrun wait_status = 0" ...

regards,
Mathias
