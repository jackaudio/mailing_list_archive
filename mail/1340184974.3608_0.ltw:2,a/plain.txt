I've been seeing similar behaviour, but in my case it's when using ALSA
pcm_multi to combine several sound cards into one virtual device. This has
been happening here ever since I started using jackd over six years ago. It
seems that under certain conditions jack1 and jack2 report xruns that aren't
audible and aren't reported by the alsa driver. There's nothing wrong with
the recorded audio when this occurs. Period size affects the number of these
xrun indications, but even using -p1024 doesn't eliminate them completely.

My workaround has been to turn off xrun markers in Ardour and ignore the
problem. Not very helpful I know, but I haven't had time to look into it
further and it hasn't prevented me from getting work done.
