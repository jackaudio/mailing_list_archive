&gt; My workaround has been to turn off xrun markers in Ardour and ignore the

&gt; further and it hasn't prevented me from getting work done.

One thing I did get time to do recently was add some printfs to
jackd/engine.c to try and work out what was happening. I reported the
results to this list a few weeks ago, but I don't think anyone had time
to look at it.

Here's a copy of that email (apologies for repeating it, but I couldn't
access the list archives to link to the original):

&gt; I've been looking at the XRun detection code in jackd/engine.c 
&gt; (jack 0.121.3) to see if I could find any clues to why JACK clients
&gt; like Ardour2 report xruns in some situations, when nothing is apparently
&gt; wrong with the audio and the alsa driver doesn't report any xruns.
&gt; I encounter this regularly when using ALSA pcm_multi to combine several
&gt; sound cards into one virtual device (as described here: 
&gt; http://www.jrigg.co.uk/linuxaudio/ice1712multi.html).
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what appears to be the relevant section in jackd/engine.c starting
&gt; at line 2071 (extra printfs added by me):
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; static void
&gt; jack_engine_delay (jack_engine_t *engine, float delayed_usecs)
&gt; {
&gt; 	jack_event_t event;
&gt; 	
&gt; 	engine-&gt;control-&gt;frame_timer.reset_pending = 1;
&gt; 
&gt; /*****************************************************************************/
&gt; 	printf("xrun_delayed_usecs %f\n", engine-&gt;control-&gt;xrun_delayed_usecs);
&gt; 	printf("max_delayed_usecs %f\n", engine-&gt;control-&gt;max_delayed_usecs);
&gt; 	printf("delayed_usecs %f\n", delayed_usecs);
&gt; /*****************************************************************************/
&gt; 
&gt; 	engine-&gt;control-&gt;xrun_delayed_usecs = delayed_usecs;
&gt; 
&gt; 	if (delayed_usecs &gt; engine-&gt;control-&gt;max_delayed_usecs)
&gt; 		engine-&gt;control-&gt;max_delayed_usecs = delayed_usecs;
&gt; 
&gt; 	event.type = XRun;
&gt; 	
&gt; 	jack_deliver_event_to_all (engine, &amp;event);
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The above code doesn't run when I use a single sound card. Running a pair
&gt; of ice1712 based cards with pcm_multi produces a slew of printf messages
&gt; like these, scrolling rapidly off the screen:
&gt; 
&gt; xrun_delayed_usecs 0.000000
&gt; max_delayed_usecs 0.000000
&gt; delayed_usecs 0.000000
&gt; 
&gt; The values are always zero.
&gt; 
&gt; xrun_delayed_usecs gets initialised to 0 on line 1997.
&gt; max_delayed_usecs gets initialised to 0 on line 1998.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't find anywhere where these values get changed between
&gt; initialisation and being used in the above code. Can this be correct?
