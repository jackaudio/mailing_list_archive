&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway ... I just start jackd ... and after a while, I count the xrun_callback in
&gt;&gt; a jack_client.
&gt;&gt; &gt; After 3 Minutes of running jackd (without any audio playing) I got already
&gt;&gt; 500 xruns reported.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've been seeing similar behaviour, but in my case it's when using ALSA
&gt;&gt; pcm_multi to combine several sound cards into one virtual device. This has
&gt;&gt; been happening here ever since I started using jackd over six years ago. It
&gt;&gt; seems that under certain conditions jack1 and jack2 report xruns that aren't
&gt; audible and aren't reported by the alsa driver. There's nothing wrong with
&gt;&gt; the recorded audio when this occurs. Period size affects the number of these
&gt;&gt; xrun indications, but even using -p1024 doesn't eliminate them completely.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; My workaround has been to turn off xrun markers in Ardour and ignore the
&gt;&gt; problem. Not very helpful I know, but I haven't had time to look into it
&gt;&gt; further and it hasn't prevented me from getting work done.

Thanks for that hint. I have also 2 TDMs in the system. As soon, as I use only one, in asound.conf, all these XRUNS are gone ...
I think I need to dig more into that...

Mathias
