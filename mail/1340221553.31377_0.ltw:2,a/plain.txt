Again thanks for the tip, but unfortunately it didn't work out. I also tried 
non-realtime mode just to be sure, but same effect with or without -S. 
Terminating jackd just after the last test and playing a song using 
audacity/alsa instead of audacity/jack gave me sound. 

Any further ideas?

My plan using the sources was to check jack actually gets signal, and jack 
sends the signal afterwards... May it be possible the the nvidia audio stuff 
alsa reports somehow interferes? I used the same settings on my old 32bit 
machine with the same interface and it just worked fine. I also have a Acer 
netbook (64bit, intel atom dual core), where the config works, too.
