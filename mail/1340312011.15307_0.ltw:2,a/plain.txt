Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Internal vs external clients

Hi,

I have a few questions regarding Jackd and its clients.

    1) Are internal clients used to control/manipulate the jack server,
while an external client is used to interact with the jackd server?   Is
this the big difference or is there more?

   2) I've been playing around with simple client. Specifically, I have
been manipulating the way it handles command line inputs. In one terminal I
have jackd(which is set via a series of cmd line args) running.  In another
window, I compile and execute the simple client. Within the program I am
using the function jack_client_open. I noticed the following:

       - The program attempts to open another jack server (it fails because
there is one already running).

       - If I close the jack server running in the other terminal, then
once I execute the program it successfully brings up a default jack
server.  I am trying to get my program to connect to the jack server I have
running in a separate terminal. Can you tell me why this is not happening
if I am using the following command at the terminal : (  sudo jackd -R -T
-v -c s -d alsa -d hw:0 -M -H -i 2 -n 2 -o 2 -p 256 -r 48000)

       - Ideally I would like to input all of the necessary flag
setting(ie: -R -T -v -c s -d alsa -d hw:0 -M -H -i 2 -n 2 -o 2 -p 256 -r
48000) into a function so that once I execute the program it automatically
fires up jackd with the prescribed settings? Can you point me in the right
direction if that is possible?


 Thanks
