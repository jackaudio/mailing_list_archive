Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack2: lots of "unknown requests" when running Sooperlooper

Hi all,

Since Jack2 somehow went verbose by default on Arch Linux I noticed that
sooperlooper doesn't cope well with a verbose jack2 (tested versions 1.9.8
down to 1.9.6) .  Jackd just spits out  "Unknown request <random number>"
continually. I suspect this is an issue in Sooperlooper and would like to
fix it. It doesn't occur with a verbose jack1 however.

This is the relevant class that handles jack in Sooperlooper:
https://github.com/essej/sooperlooper/blob/master/src/jack_audio_driver.cpp

Any help appreciated.

Best,

Kaspar
