Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Why does jack change the sampling rate?

Hi,

I am starting daemon with the following:

jackd -T-v -d alsa -d hw:0 -p 256 -r 8000 -S


Below I have added what jack is telling me. I see where it is telling me
that is configuring the card for a sample rate of 8000(configuring for
8000Hz, period = 256 frames (32.0 ms), buffer = 2 periods).  I see where it
changes it to 44100 as well.

I am starting qjacktl with the same parameters(or as close as I can get
it), and it is reporting the sampling rate to be 44100.
