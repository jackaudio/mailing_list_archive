Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Proper way to play 2 channels on the same output.

Hi,

First off, I want to say thanks to all the hard working people who
develop jack. It's a truly awesome piece of software.

I'm developing my first jack application. I've got all the basic jack
stuff in place and it seems to work, but I've run into my first
problem where I think my lack of jack/audio knowledge is hurting me.
Basically what I'm doing is connecting a source app (testing with
zynaddsubfx) both to my system outputs and to my app. Inside my app,
I'm copying the input into a jack_default_audio_sample_t array, then
after a certain amount of time has passed, I start playing it, while
the original is still going to system output. So basically it's giving
me a delay effect. This works fine on my USB DAC, but for some reason
when I use my motherboard's audio sometimes when 2 tones (one from
zynaddsubfx and one being repeated by my app) at the same time on the
same channel, the sound is distorted. I have a feeling that I'm
missing something obvious. Do I need to do some sort of combining
process on the 2 streams in order for them to play properly, or is
there just something wrong with my soundcard?

Thanks,
Tim
