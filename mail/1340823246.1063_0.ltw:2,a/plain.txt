Clipping? That is, the sum of the two signals exceed the maximum or
minimum value? In jack, it's -1.0 .. 1.0.

So instead of simply copying the samples, multiply them with let's say
0.5 and check if the problem still exists. Or simply lower the volume in
zynaddsubfx.

Easy test setup: record zynaddsubfx and your delay output in one channel
and see if it exceeds the range. You can even write a client that simply
checks for too large values:

   for (int i=0; i < nframes; i++) {
      if (fabsf(inbuffer[i]) > 1.0) {
	 printf ("Signal too large\n"); /* bad! not RT-safe */
      }
   }


Disclaimer: don't do printf in the process() callback in production
code.
