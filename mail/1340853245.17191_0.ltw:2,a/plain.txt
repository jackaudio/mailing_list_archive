Paul,

Thanks for the interpretation. It has really changed some things for me. I
wanted to run this by you.

I ran the following command: lspci | grep -i audio

00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio
Controller (rev 02)

I also had the system generate a report of all sound related devices on my
machine. Attached is a list.

Without having to get a new card, is there anything I can do to get jack to
capture at a sample rate of 8khz, mono and using 16 or 8 bit samples?

Thanks a lot
