Hi,

Latency arguments aside...

Well it builds and runs. Midi inputs and outputs appear in jack_lsp. This is a
good start.

I ported (kind-of) qjackctl and non-sequencer [1], ran jackd, jack_umidi
and used qjackctl to hook up non-sequencer's midi out to my midi out
port. The midi interface has a LED indicating activity, which sadly did
not blink. The midi interface is known to work (tested under windows 7 with
seq24).

I am not really sure if either qjackctl or non-sequencer are doing their
jobs. The next step would be to try and hook up the inputs using command
line tools. Is there any documentation on these? Manual pages seem to be
absent and I have not found anything on the jack website.

It would be useful if there was a command to send midi events to a jack output.
This way I could rule out non-sequencer as a point of failure.

Cheers
