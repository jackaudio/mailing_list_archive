Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack session questions

Hi,

Just wondering if there are any behaviour recommendations?

Any recommendations to disable quit/close/open/save/etc when the
client is under jack session management? (Can a client know if it's
under jack session management - does that even mean anything outside
of the callback?)

Should clients assume their executable is installed in a path in
$PATH? If my client can work out it was started in a relative path
should it then work out the full path and pass that in reply to jack
session? This would allow a using a different version to the installed
version of some software to interact with jack-session (ie for
development testing of jack session).

Cheers,
James.
