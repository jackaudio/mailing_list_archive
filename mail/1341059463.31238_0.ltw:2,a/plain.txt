Your usage is a bit unusual.

It seems like you want to connect certain ports when you start jack?

You don't need to use alsa configuration to achieve that goal. Just tell
qjackctl to store the graph and load it on start.

You can also write a script for that purpose.

And then there are a few other jack session management tools such as
ladish, non, lash, patchage, etc...

However if you are getting only two ports in qjackctl then you have a
problem with your jack setup or card configuration.

It's unclear exactly how many ports you can currently see in qjackctl
connections window...
