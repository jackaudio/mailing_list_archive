Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Debian/Linux USB

Dear Jack Members:

I am new to jack and have a very basic question, which is probably
quite elementary in terms of Jack.

What I need to do involves connecting one of the commercially
available Midi Instrument to USB adapter cables adapters to my
PC USB port.  My PC runs on a fairly modern version of Debian
Linux.  What I need to do is even simpler. In particular I need
to write and read bytes from the USB port to verify that
parsing the and generating Midi messages is working
correctly.  Fidelity is not an issue.

Does Jack included an API that will work for this purpose and
are any special USB drivers needed if so ?

Best Regards,

Paul R.
