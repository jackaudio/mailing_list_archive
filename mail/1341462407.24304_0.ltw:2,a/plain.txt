Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Fwd: [Qemu-discuss] Can't get rid of that white screen on Lion

Just for information, I decided to uninstall Jack (using the provided script), rebooted and qemu-system-arm began to work ok (the ones compiled with gcc-4.2 not llvm).

No more hang on white screen, debian arm boots just fine.

Any idea on why Jack could prevent the qemu arm target to work ?
