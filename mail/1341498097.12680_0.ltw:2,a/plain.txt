Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Finding a great developer to assist with System implementation

We have a significant issue with latency sync'ing up audio to up to 20
different TV broadcasts in a Local Area Network - ie taking the live
audio feeds and rebroadcasting them via wifi to different devices from
laptops to mobile devices - iOS to Android and all in between.

If you know or can direct us to a developer that has probably already
figured out the configuration for such a system it would be greatly
appreciated -  thanks for your attention and insight - the system looks
'perfect' - thanks

J
