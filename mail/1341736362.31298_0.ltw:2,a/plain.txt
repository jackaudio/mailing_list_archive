Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Recording with JACK on new hardware

Hello everyone,

I have made very good experiences with JACK in the past, even using it
as a foundation for my bachelor thesis. Now I bought a new laptop and
can't help myself: The JACK Server won't start. I guess this is due my
graphics having an HDMI output (two graphics cards in my laptop: AMD
A8 APU with Radeon 6600G and additional Radeon 7670 HD ).This is what
cat /proc/asound/cards says:

 0 [Generic        ]: HDA-Intel - HD-Audio Generic
                      HD-Audio Generic at 0xf0344000 irq 41
 1 [Generic_1      ]: HDA-Intel - HD-Audio Generic
                      HD-Audio Generic at 0xf0340000 irq 16

And cat /proc/asound/modules:
 0 snd_hda_intel
 1 snd_hda_intel

JACK Error log:
JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10
control device hw:0

JackServer::Open() failed with -1
Failed to open server

OS:
Ubuntu GNU/Linux 12.04 amd64
JACK installed from Ubuntu ppa
jackdmp version 1.9.8 tmpdir /dev/shm protocol 8

When I explicitly select "hw 0, 1" in JACK, the audio server starts,
but there is no sound at either of the input/outputs. I know that this
information may not be that helpful, I hoped that you can ask for the
information you need me to provide.

Thank you very much!

Jacob
