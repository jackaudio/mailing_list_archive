Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Sync problems, need smarter eyes?

Hi folks, I've made a midi clock test app to help track down the issues
I've been having on OS X, but am getting some strange behaviour. Every once
in a while, I'm getting two clock messages 1 or 2 ms apart. I'm no jack or
C expert so it's quite possible I've made a stupid math error or something.
If anyone has the time to take a look at it, that would be really helpful
and would help us figure out whether there is an issue with the OSX midi
driver. In the app I deliberately aligned the tempo to frame buffers to
keep out as many sources of error as I could, it would be great to know
whether this looks like it should work.

I test it by syncing up Ableton as a slave, and when the duplicate messages
come, there is a noticeable lurch in sync.

Thanks
Iain
