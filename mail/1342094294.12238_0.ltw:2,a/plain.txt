Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Sync problems with jack outputting midi clock

Yes  I would say that if the MIDI message correctly circulate inside JACK MIDI (so using jack_midi_dump would allow to test that part...) then the problem is probably in the  CoreMIDI and JACK  bridge.

Iain can you test with  jack_midi_dump?

Thanks.
