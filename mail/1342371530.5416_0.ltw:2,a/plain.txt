Subject:     [Jack-Devel] OS X jack midi message issues between jack and core midi

Hi everyone, following Paul and Stephane's suggestion, I ran jack_midi_dump
along with a standard os x midi monitor during my sync tests.

Files, including source and screenshot, are at:
http://industry.flyingnotfalling.com/audio_code

Here is what I've found ( duplicated in link as jack_midi_test_notes )

- system is OS X 10.6.8
- jack is Jack OSX 0.9 ( beta from Stephane )
- test app compiled with:
  g++ -o jack_midi_1 -framework Jackmp jack_midi_1.cpp

- occasional clock messages are either dropped or duplicated
- if you look at the top of the screen shot, you can see:
  - 24 clock messages per quarter in the jack_midi_dump output
  - a duplicate clock message at 9:38:838 and 9:38:839 in the midi monitor
- when these duplicate messages happen, there is a noticeable lurch in the
sync
  with abletone live ( running using jack as audio driver )

With my larger app, it's mostly dropped messages instead of duplicates. I
could get screen shots of that happening if that is useful too.

Not sure what, if anything, I can do next. Does this mean that the Jack
midi to Core Midi bridge is the culprit?

Thanks
Iain
