This could very well be the case.

FTR, I wrote the driver with absolutely *zero* access to a Mac and, thus,
was never able to give the code a thorough debugging. :O

@Iain: Do you have access to a Linux machine running JACK?  If so, can you
test your code with the alsarawmidi driver and/or the FFADO driver?  I'd
like to figure out whether the culprit is the MIDI queue system code shared
between drivers, or the code specific to the JACK CoreMidi driver.

Thanks in advance,
