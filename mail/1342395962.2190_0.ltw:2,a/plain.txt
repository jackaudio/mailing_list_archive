Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] OS X jack midi message issues between jack and core midi

Hi Devin (or anyone!), can you tell me I understand correctly what I need
to do to test the fix:

- check out Jack 2 trunk from github,
- apply the diff to JackCoreMidiOutputPort.cpp
- recompile and reinstall jack
- build my test app again linked to the new jack
- run test again

I'm worried about me not managing the above correctly and relaying false
results, so want to make sure.

Thanks
Iain
