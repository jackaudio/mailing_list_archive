I'd like to help test, but as I'm new to OS X, I'm totally lost. I did a
git clone of https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2.git but don't know what to
do next.

- how do I build? There are no build instructions for osx in the readme.
- is this a drop in replacement for Jack 1.9.9? I've been using the Jack
OSX package install, so I'm not clear if that is even using Jack 2.
- will this fix jack 1.9.9 on os x or is jack 2 something different?
- if I need to install this, how do I remove the older one anyway?

sorry to be so useless. Only started using my hackintosh recently and don't
know much about building on it yet.

thanks
iain
