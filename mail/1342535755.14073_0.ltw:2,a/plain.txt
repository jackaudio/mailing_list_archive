Subject:     [Jack-Devel] symbol lookup error

Hello!

I am running into a problem trying to install Jack 1.9.8. The waf
configure, build and install commands all work fine, but when I try to run
jackd, I get a 'symbol lookup error':

$ jackd -R -d alsa
>jackdmp 1.9.8

>jackd: symbol lookup error: jackd: undefined symbol:
jackctl_driver_get_type

I have searched through the mailing list archive and online, and it seems
that other people have run into this problem too. Unfortunately what worked
for them hasn't worked for me yet. I included the option "--prefix /usr" in
my waf configure command, and I have run 'sudo ldconfig' after installing,
but I still get the same error.

Thanks ahead of time,
Tim
