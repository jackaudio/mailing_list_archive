Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Connecting alsa-loopback to jack

Hi,

since http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge 
seemsdead and gone, I'm asking here, as I believe there are quite a lot of 
experts reading the list.

After I finally got jack workingusing jack1 I want to connect the alsa 
loopback device with my recording/playback interface to be able to use both 
devices with jack.

Jack is just working fine. But trying to playback with the loop device gives 
no sound.

I'm sure, this is just aconfiguration problem, but I'm not able to figure out 
the correct config.

This is what I got so far:

jankoh@kohni ~ $ cat .asoundrc
# playback PCM device: using loopback subdevice 0,0
pcm.amix {
        type dmix
        ipc_key 219345
        slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0,0"
}

# capture PCM device: using loopback subdevice 0,1
pcm.asnoop {
        type dsnoop
        ipc_key 219346
        slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0,1"
}

# duplex device combining above PCM devices
pcm.aduplex {
        type asym
        playback.pcm "amix"
        capture.pcm "asnoop"
}

pcm.merge {
    type multi;
    slaves.a.pcm hw:Blackjack
    slaves.a.channels 2;
    slaves.b.pcm hw:Loopback
    slaves.b.channels 2;
    bindings.0.slave a;
    bindings.0.channel 0;
    bindings.1.slave b;
    bindings.1.channel 0;
    bindings.2.slave a;
    bindings.2.channel 1;
    bindings.3.slave b;
    bindings.3.channel 1;
}

ctl.merge {
    type hw
    card 2
}
jankoh@kohni ~ $ cat /proc/asound/cards 
 0 [SB             ]: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI SB
                      HDA ATI SB at 0xfdff4000 irq 16

                      Loopback 1
jankoh@kohni ~ $ 

Can you point me to related documentation or give me a hint, where the error 
could be?

Thanks!
