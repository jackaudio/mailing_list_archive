(ignoring pcm.merge for the moment, it's not entirely obvious to me how
you plan on using that)

Looks like you're missing the connections between pcm.aduplex and jack that use
card 1.  You'll need something like:

pcm.cloop {
    type dsnoop
    ipc_key 219347
    slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,1,0"
}
pcm.ploop {
    type plug
    slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,1,1"
}

Then you can run "alsa_in -d cloop" and/or "alsa_out -d ploop" and
finally connect them up with jack_connect alsa_in:capture_1 system:playback_1
jack_connect alsa_in:capture_2 system:playback_2 or similar.
