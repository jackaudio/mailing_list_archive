After the disappearance, I wrote something plus or minus similar, and
in my bad English, into the gentoo pro-audio overlay's wiki:
http://proaudio.tuxfamily.org/wiki/index.php?title=DAW_Digital_Audio_Workstation#Using_an_ALSA_Loopback_device_and_JACK_alsa_in.2Falsa_out_clients

The text explanation is shorter than what you wrote, but hopefully, the
code for the configuration must be very similar.
