well, that was the page, I had the basic configuration from. Thanks for that, 
it is working. But I have one problem with it: I got jitter in the sound when 
playing through the alsa_in stuff (alsa_out isn't working either, but that's 
not a problem).

So I looked around and found that merge stuff described at

http://jackaudio.org/multiple_devices

as I *think* the jitter might come by the fact, alsa_in is resampling stuff. I 
*thought* I could run jack on the merged device then just configure non-jack-
aware apps using the loopback, and connect jack-aware apps directly.

Is this possible at all or am I missunderstanding that stuff?
