Hi again,

Thanks for the input, that got it working, but there are still issues I 
explained in the answer to Dominique.

&gt; Having (I hope so) helped you to do what you wish, I must tell that having
&gt; used this facility myself, I came to realize that I was nothing but stupid.
&gt; As a matter of fact, I think we can state that nowadays, the applications
&gt; not jack-aware are consumer grade applications playing medias of relatively
&gt; poor audio quality.

Well, I'm aware of that. The thing is, I'm using amarok for day-to-day 
playback stuff and I have easy access to quite a large number of songs in it 
(the quality differs, depending when the stuff was digitalized, but we don't 
talk about poor-quality mp3 stuff).

When doing mixing, I'd like to be able to have access on that music stuff for 
comparing my work to the sound I'd like to reach without the need of starting 
another instance of ardour or having to use audacity. 

And as you might kow, amarok is using phonon as it's backend, and according to 
the developers of phonon, it will *never* work with jack. :(

So I'm looking for a possibillity to connect that alsa stuff to jack. It is 
not neccessary to have realtime on the alsa_in-end, as long as I guaranty 
realtime for the jack-aware apps.
