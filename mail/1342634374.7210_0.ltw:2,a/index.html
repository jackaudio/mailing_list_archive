&gt; Well, I'm aware of that. The thing is, I'm using amarok for day-to-day
&gt; playback stuff and I have easy access to quite a large number of songs in
&gt; it
&gt; (the quality differs, depending when the stuff was digitalized, but we
&gt; don't
&gt; talk about poor-quality mp3 stuff).
&gt;
&gt; When doing mixing, I'd like to be able to have access on that music stuff
&gt; for
&gt; comparing my work to the sound I'd like to reach without the need of
&gt; starting
&gt; another instance of ardour or having to use audacity.
&gt;
&gt; And as you might kow, amarok is using phonon as it's backend, and
&gt; according to
&gt; the developers of phonon, it will *never* work with jack. :(
&gt;

this is not correct. phonon can use gstreamer which can talk to JACK.

i use rhythmbox every day to listen to my music collection and to internet
radio, while working on ardour &amp; (very occasionally) JACK. there are a
couple of annoyances (the main one is that the gstreamer JACK plugin can't
handle zombification). otherwise it works flawlessly (and would work better
for someone who wasn't constantly starting and stopping crash-prone
versions of various JACK clients.
