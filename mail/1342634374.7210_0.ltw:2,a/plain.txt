this is not correct. phonon can use gstreamer which can talk to JACK.

i use rhythmbox every day to listen to my music collection and to internet
radio, while working on ardour & (very occasionally) JACK. there are a
couple of annoyances (the main one is that the gstreamer JACK plugin can't

for someone who wasn't constantly starting and stopping crash-prone
versions of various JACK clients.
