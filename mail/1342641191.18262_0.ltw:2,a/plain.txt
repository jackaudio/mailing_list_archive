Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Connecting alsa-loopback to jack

In my last updates to the WIKI page, I stated that the asoundrc file had to be tailored to one's jack setup.

The generic asoundrc I originally posted is really not the best one can use. It really has to fit your jack params and you do not have to use dsnoop or dmix if you only have one ALSA-only client. One can even load the snd-aloop module with an option to declare more than one virtual loopback device. I believe the limit is 32 (from memory).
So if your ALSA-only clients can be configured to use a particular ALSA device, you can configure every one of them to use a particular and unique loopback device.
Every loopback device can then be bridged directly to jack, without the need to use a PCM plugin (dsnoop or dmix).

Anyway, it boils down to one's taste and needs. Personally, I only use the loopback device for playback (skype output, flash player).

I got it working. The problem was solved with a simple config change:
pcm.cloop {
    type dsnoop
    ipc_key 219347
    slave {
        pcm "hw:Loopback,1,0"
        #format S32_LE
        #period_size 2048
        #buffer_size 8192
        rate 48000
    }
}

Commenting out period and buffer size removed the jitter...
