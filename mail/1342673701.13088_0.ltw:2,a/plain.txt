Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] packed data structures in jack2

The point to pack memory is to allow a 64 bits server to be used with 32 bits clients or the contrary. Since shared memory is going to be used by "both sides", the only safe way we found was to use packed memory struct.

If 64/32 bits code cohabitation is not mandatory, then I guess "packed" can be disabled.
