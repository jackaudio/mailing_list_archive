&gt; &gt; The point to pack memory is to allow a 64 bits server to be used with 32

&gt; Ah, thanks, I see now. I see how putting packed on everything does make
&gt; this easier. However, it also makes the code unusable on some platforms
&gt; and slow on others. Would you be open to alternative approaches here? I'd
&gt; be willing to do some work to help out


 [ ... ]


&gt;
&gt; /* ... this type has the same layout between 32-bit and 64-bit. */
&gt; struct A_with_alignment {
&gt;   aligned_char x;
&gt;   aligned_int64_t i;
&gt; };
&gt;

this translates to:

     struct A_with_alignment {
          char     x    __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(char));
          int64_t i     __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(int64_t));
      };

which i think is not the same as what "packed" does at all. it could be
enough though, and arguably is better because it preserves aligned access.

however, as stephane noted: far easier to just change the macros that do
this stuff so that they are no-ops.


&gt; As another idea would be to have a source file which simply includes all
&gt; the important headers and is compiled with -Wpadded and maybe even
&gt; -Werror, to catch any mistakes.
&gt;

i don't this is portable to non-gnu compilers. i could be wrong.
