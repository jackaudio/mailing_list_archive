this translates to:

     struct A_with_alignment {
          char     x    __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(char));
          int64_t i     __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(int64_t));
      };

which i think is not the same as what "packed" does at all. it could be
enough though, and arguably is better because it preserves aligned access.

however, as stephane noted: far easier to just change the macros that do
this stuff so that they are no-ops.

i don't this is portable to non-gnu compilers. i could be wrong.
