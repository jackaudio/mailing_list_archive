&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; this translates to:
&gt; 
&gt;      struct A_with_alignment {
&gt;           char     x    __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(char));
&gt;           int64_t i     __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(int64_t));
&gt;       };
&gt; 
&gt; which i think is not the same as what "packed" does at all. it could be
&gt; enough though, and arguably is better because it preserves aligned access.

Right, the goal isn't to emulate "packed" exactly; the goal is to solve a
specific problem without incurring the undesirable side effects :-).

&gt; 
&gt; however, as stephane noted: far easier to just change the macros that do
&gt; this stuff so that they are no-ops.

This is easy to do, and it works for my project today. However, I was
thinking about what would be best for Jack in the long term.

I think it would be preferable to have a solution which could support
mixed 64/32 mode even on platforms which don't have misaligned accesses
(64-bit ARM chips are coming...), which would avoid the performance
issues, and which would avoid "breaking the rules" even on platforms
where it works, because clever compiler writers can still theoretically 
find ways to take advantage of alignment assumptions there. And it would
undo what is technically an ABI break in the recent addition of "packed"
to &lt;jack/types.h&gt;.

I think it's even worthwhile to make moderately more invasive source
changes to achieve this. And, I'm willing to do some work to help make it
happen. But if the maintainers disagree, I'll move on.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As another idea would be to have a source file which simply includes all
&gt; &gt; the important headers and is compiled with -Wpadded and maybe even
&gt; &gt; -Werror, to catch any mistakes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; i don't this is portable to non-gnu compilers. i could be wrong.

Perhaps so, or perhaps other compilers have analogous features; I don't
know offhand. I'd be willing to do some research here. It might not be a
complete solution, but it might be a nice sanity check, regardless.
