&gt;&gt;&gt; struct A_with_alignment {
&gt;&gt;&gt;  aligned_char x;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  aligned_int64_t i;
&gt;&gt;&gt; };
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; this translates to:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;     struct A_with_alignment {
&gt;&gt;          char     x    __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(char));
&gt;&gt;          int64_t i     __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(int64_t));
&gt;&gt;      };
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; which i think is not the same as what "packed" does at all. it could be
&gt;&gt; enough though, and arguably is better because it preserves aligned access.
&gt; 
&gt; Right, the goal isn't to emulate "packed" exactly; the goal is to solve a
&gt; specific problem without incurring the undesirable side effects :-).
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; however, as stephane noted: far easier to just change the macros that do
&gt;&gt; this stuff so that they are no-ops.
&gt; 
&gt; This is easy to do, and it works for my project today. However, I was
&gt; thinking about what would be best for Jack in the long term.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it would be preferable to have a solution which could support
&gt; mixed 64/32 mode even on platforms which don't have misaligned accesses
&gt; (64-bit ARM chips are coming...), which would avoid the performance
&gt; issues, and which would avoid "breaking the rules" even on platforms
&gt; where it works, because clever compiler writers can still theoretically 
&gt; find ways to take advantage of alignment assumptions there. And it would
&gt; undo what is technically an ABI break in the recent addition of "packed"
&gt; to &lt;jack/types.h&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it's even worthwhile to make moderately more invasive source
&gt; changes to achieve this. And, I'm willing to do some work to help make it
&gt; happen. But if the maintainers disagree, I'll move on.

Use a git branch.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; As another idea would be to have a source file which simply includes all
&gt;&gt;&gt; the important headers and is compiled with -Wpadded and maybe even
&gt;&gt;&gt; -Werror, to catch any mistakes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; i don't this is portable to non-gnu compilers. i could be wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps so, or perhaps other compilers have analogous features; I don't
&gt; know offhand. I'd be willing to do some research here. It might not be a
&gt; complete solution, but it might be a nice sanity check, regardless.

It has to work on Windows with VC++ and Mingw kid of compiler at least.
