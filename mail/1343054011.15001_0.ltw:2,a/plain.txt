Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JackGraphOrderCallback - on error?

Hi,

Another developer has submitted some code for JNAJack
(http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/) to implement some missing
callbacks in the Java mapping, such as the graph order callback.
Before integrating this I wanted to check what the error code returned
by the graph order callback actually means and what effect a non-zero
code actually has (I presume the client can't veto the change(?), so
does this disconnect the client or do something else?).  I couldn't
seem to find any documentation of this on the website - please feel
free to point me to it if I missed something obvious.

Thanks and best wishes,

Neil
