Subject:     [Jack-Devel] problems building example_clients with debug info

Hi,

I wanted to build the example clients with debug info to get a
backtrace when jack_server_control --help segfaults (ticket added to
trac) but have been unable to do so.

./configure issues a warning about installed versions and suggests the
--with-prefix option will enable building despite this, but even with
that option the ./configure still halts at the warning message.

I then tried building jack_server_control alone by issuing:

gcc `pkg-config --libs jack` server_control.c

but this results in lots of undefined references to `jackctl_server_*'
which was unexpected.

jackd version 0.121.3

James.
