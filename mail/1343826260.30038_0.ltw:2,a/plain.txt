Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Windows Sound Interface for Jack Router

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone has an implementation that allows windows applications (Direct Sound, MME, Coreaudio) without ASIO or JACK interfaces to use JACK through the JACK Router? If not, would it be possilbe or is there a work around? If not, can someone point me in the right direction to make this possible (i.e. virtual driver)?

Thanks,

Doug
