Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows Sound Interface for Jack Router

I'm not a dev in this field, and hope somebody more involved in JACK-dev
will fill you in on details.

As a workaround I remember an application called ASIO4ALL, which allowed
ASIO playback on all hardware. I think this may be in the wrong direction,
your trying to make a non-ASIO playback on JackRouter (ASIO), but I think
Asio4All is designed to allow ASIO software playback on non-ASIO
hardware. I don't have a windows machine to experiment, but perhaps its can
be part of a workaround.
