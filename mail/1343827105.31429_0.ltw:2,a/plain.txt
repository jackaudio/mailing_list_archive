Hi Doug,

With the Jack Audio Connection Kit, audio communication works like this
Jack Client -> Jack Server -> Audio System

On Windows, JackRouter is an ASIO -> Jack Client service, it provides
an ASIO driver layer to the application and routes those audio streams
via the JACK API to the Jack Server.

So I guess the real question that you are asking, is:
How do I connect a Windows Audio application that does not have ASIO
capabilities to the Jack Server? And as far as I know, you can't.
Adding a DS interface to JackRouter (or creating a different router
client) may be possible but I'm not a programmer so I can't say if
that is even possible.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
