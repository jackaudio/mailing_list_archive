Thanks for the quick replies. ASIO4ALL allows ASIO applications to use
non-ASIO supported hardware. What I need is for non-ASIO applications to
use ASIO hardware (i.e. JackRouter) or create a windows application
interface for JACK Server.

I might have a solution, although not elegant, but I wanted to see what
others thoughts are. 

Essentially I was thinking I could use an off-the-shelf product like
"Virtual Audio Cable" (VAC) that presents the windows application as a
device to other applications, and then use the Jack Net backend with the
"audioadapter" client which would multicast to another instance of Jack
acting as the master (on the same machine). The problem here is that
multiple instances of jackd would be running and trying to access the
same multicast ports (jackd does not allow reuse of the ports). I could
either rebuild jackd to allow reuse or write an application that uses
those ports in reuse mode such that both instances of jackd can access
the ports. 

I know your grinning right now because it is a hoakie work around, and I
haven't tested to see if it would even work but...If there are any other
suggestions please let me know.

Thanks,

Doug

Hi Doug,

With the Jack Audio Connection Kit, audio communication works like this
Jack Client -> Jack Server -> Audio System

On Windows, JackRouter is an ASIO -> Jack Client service, it provides
an ASIO driver layer to the application and routes those audio streams
via the JACK API to the Jack Server.

So I guess the real question that you are asking, is:
How do I connect a Windows Audio application that does not have ASIO
capabilities to the Jack Server? And as far as I know, you can't.
Adding a DS interface to JackRouter (or creating a different router
client) may be possible but I'm not a programmer so I can't say if
that is even possible.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
