You may read the "Developing a Virtual Audio Driver on Windows " thread in december on PA mailing list :

http://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/portaudio/2011-December/thread.html

The conclusion is that it would require kernel development, and would probably add latency... So seems too much work for tiny added value.  

Probably better to convince applications developers to support ASIO model...

If not, would it be possilbe or is there a work around? If not, can someone point me in the right direction to make this possible (i.e. virtual driver)?
