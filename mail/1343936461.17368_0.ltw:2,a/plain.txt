I got around to looking at the JACK 2 code on github.com/jackaudio,
and I don't see the fix applied for duplicate messages that I sent
over.  I think the fix should be applied.

As far as dropped messages go, I noticed that the ProcessRead() and
ProcessWrite() calls in JackCoreMidiDriver now have TryLock() calls:

    int
    JackCoreMidiDriver::ProcessRead()
    {
        int res;
        if (Trylock()) {
            res = (fEngineControl->fSyncMode) ? ProcessReadSync() :
ProcessReadAsync();
            Unlock();
        } else {
            res = -1;
        }
        return res;
    }

    int
    JackCoreMidiDriver::ProcessWrite()
    {
        int res;
        if (Trylock()) {
            res = (fEngineControl->fSyncMode) ? ProcessWriteSync() :
ProcessWriteAsync();
            Unlock();
        } else {
            res = -1;
        }
        return res;
    }

Could this be the reason for the dropped messages?
