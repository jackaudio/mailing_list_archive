I don't think it fixes the *whole* issue.  Note that Iain said:

... referencing both dropped messages and duplicate messages.  I think
that my patch takes care of one possible source of duplicate messages.

I assume you've verified that the problem exists, and checked to make
sure that Restart() hasn't been called when messages are dropped.
I'll look elsewhere.

@Iain: Have you checked to see if JACK is outputting any error
messages when MIDI messages are dropped?
