I apologise that it's been nearly a year since this thread died. Life
became pretty 'interesting' after my daughter was born!

I was wondering, in the time since the last update happened on this, has
anyone else approached and/or succeeded with a project like this?

&gt; &gt; This is where I need the advice of those who are experienced with the
&gt; inner
&gt; &gt; workings of netJACK:
&gt;
&gt; Disclaimer: I'm not, but since nobody has answered your question, I took
&gt; a brief look at the code.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If JACK sends uncompressed audio, is it in a particular format (WAV or
&gt; raw
&gt; &gt; PCM)?
&gt;
&gt; WAV is a file header and obviously not a valid answer. PCM sounds a lot
&gt; better. ;)
&gt;
&gt; If you check netjack_packet.c, there's render_jack_ports_to_payload().
&gt; Depending on the required bitdepth, it either encodes audio data as
&gt; 8bit, 16bit or float. In the float case, those are either native floats
&gt; (depending on the host CPU) or treated as int32 and then converted to
&gt; network byte order.
&gt;
&gt; Given that you're creating a locally attached soundcard, aim for
&gt; float32le. "le" is little endian, most of your target CPUs will use them.
&gt;
&gt; MIDI is encoded as uint32_t in network byte order (see
&gt; encode_midi_buffer).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Assuming that both the master and slave are connected to each other and
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; further identification needs to be made, what data does JACK send along
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; that audio data?
&gt;
&gt; MIDI data and, if run in autoconfig mode, a first packet that configures
&gt; the system. This is probably something neat that you might want to use
&gt; if your box is going to be the jackd master.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; At more of an opinion level, if I were to use this for our 8-channel
&gt; &gt; system, would each channel be dealt with in separate packets (series
&gt; &gt; processing), or should one packet send data from all eight channels
&gt; &gt; (parallel processing)?
&gt;
&gt; That's actually not the question you want to ask. What you want to know
&gt; is how to distribute the samples in the stream. netjack sends a given
&gt; amount (nframes) of the first channel, then followed by the same amount
&gt; of frames for the second channel and so on.
&gt;
&gt; If the payload is too large for a single packet, another one will be
&gt; created.
&gt;
&gt; So there's clearly no "a single packet per channel" concept. Better
&gt; think of a continous bitstream that's split into arbitrary chunks called
&gt; packets.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, if I have missed the scope of anything hear, please let me know,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; I'll do some more relevant research - this is still very new to me, as
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; can probably tell :-)
&gt;
&gt; How is it going? It seems you're new to C and new to VHDL. Frankly,
&gt; that's not exactly the best starting point for a hardware project. Do
&gt; you have somebody to ask in case of trouble? Like a supervisor?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
