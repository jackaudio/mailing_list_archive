Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Application crashes when connecting newly registered ports using callback.

Hi All,

I am maintainer of meterec and I am stuck with a problem when trying
to automatically connect to ports beeing newly registered.

I use jack_set_port_registration_callback() to have
process_port_register() handling new ports. In process_port_register()
I look if the port is part of the list I want to connect to and from
there call connect_any_port() function that is used also when
connecting already existing ports manually or connecting existing
ports at startup.

Only when called from process_port_register() the jack_connect()
function inside connect_any_port() fails and the app crashes after
jackd issues the following message:
'bad status (1) for client meterc handling event (type = 6)'

Do you know any reason for this failure? Can you give me hints on how
to debug this further?

Code can be seen here:

Thanks,
Fabrice.
