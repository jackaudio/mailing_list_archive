Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Application crashes when connecting newly registered ports using callback.

Thanks Paul,

I now fire a thread that deal with new connections. No crashes anymore.

I don't understand your point: is'nt the crash the result of me
calling jack_connect() from inside the callback?

Thanks,
Fabrice.
