&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am maintainer of meterec and I am stuck with a problem when trying
&gt;&gt; to automatically connect to ports beeing newly registered.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I use jack_set_port_registration_callback() to have
&gt;&gt; process_port_register() handling new ports. In process_port_register()
&gt;&gt; I look if the port is part of the list I want to connect to and from
&gt;&gt; there call connect_any_port() function that is used also when
&gt;&gt; connecting already existing ports manually or connecting existing
&gt;&gt; ports at startup.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; you cannot make calls that talk to the server while in a server-initiated
&gt; callback.

Thanks Fabrice for bringing this up!  I think I had that problem, I
meant to ask on the list but instead I gave up on jack support for a
while.  I will try having the callback kick off a thread instead of
directly doing the work.

It was a while ago, but if I remember correctly, symptoms were that
jack2 would hang until a socket connect timed out, and jack1 I don't
exactly remember, but after the app disconnected midi data would get
stuck in the buffer and the server would continually spam clients with
the same set of midi msgs.  So they definitely don't want calls from
callbacks, but "report" the error in different ways.

So documentation would be nice, as would crashing with a consistent
message when the implicit rule is violated.
