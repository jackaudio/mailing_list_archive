Subject:     [Jack-Devel] no sound after a while, although everything looks fine

Dear community,
I use qjackctl together with saffire 6 usb as the soundcard.
I also can connect to this soundcard with alsa or pulse without using jack,
without any problems so far.
But when I use qjackctl I mostly (after ca. 30 minutes) experience the
problem that I can't hear any sound, altough I can see a connection between
jack and the application.
I've made this experience with csound connected to jack as well with the
gnome mplayer.
I would like to know if this problem has to do with the saffire card or
with the jack-card.
I should mention that I use Ubuntu 12.04 and jackd2.
I have also enabled the raw 1394 access (although I don't know if I kneed
it for an usb card) and  I use qjack with realtime enabled,
