Subject:     [Jack-Devel] windows sound application via jack to cubase 6.5

Hi, I came across to Your programm jack audio in hope it could save my
problem. I want to do following thing: I have an application called
Swarshala producing tabla rhythms and tanpura sound. This program uses
the system audiosystem set to the asio of yamaha mLan via firewire. On
the other hand I have cubase 6.5. There I have sound tracks female
singing voice which I want to combine with an input of Swarshala
recording some rhythm which might fit. 

	What I have 

	HP notebook windows vista, Intel core 2 duo CPU T8300 

	External DAW Yamaha i88 firewire 

	Cubase 6.5 

	Swarshala pro 3.2 

	What I have done: 

	Installed Jack 1, Jack 2 62/32 version did not work, aske fo x86
Version 

	First I right clicked jackedport audio and set Asio to "Asio::Asio
mLan 

	than i opened cubase and set the audosystem to jackport 

	after this I opened jackcontrol and connected cubase to system and
vice versa. 

	The system audio is set to mLan out 

	When I playback cubase nothing is heard 

	When I playback Swarshala, no input signal in cubase. 

	I was studying Your informations but could not find a solution. Can
You help by a step by step leading to correct setup. 

	Thanking You in advance 

	regards Mohani Heitel
