The EEE PC 4G has the Celeron M 353 (aka the ULV processor).... this
processor totally rocks compared to an Atom processor, so you should
not be seeing this problem.[1]

It's most likely that real-time scheduling is messed up.  Are you
starting JACK with the "-R" parameter?

Try:

* Make sure you've got the -R parameter with jackd
* Use 4 period/buffer (even with a smaller period size)
* Try different combinations of period size and periods/buffer.  Not
all hardware has a power-of-two buffer.
* Make sure you have real-time permissions ('ulimit -r' shows 95 instead of 0)
* Make sure that http://jackaudio.org/linux_group_sched is not your
problem, see also the jack faq
* Set the CPU governor to "performance"
* Turn off X11 compositing
* Turn off your wifi card

Also, it's worth trying a more up-to-date distro with a "vanilla" kernel.
