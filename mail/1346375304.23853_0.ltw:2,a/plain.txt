Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [Jack-devel] Jack-Devel Digest, Vol 71, Issue 22

Hello steve I have been tweaking an install of flstudio on snow leopard
10.6.8  and have a question , do you think it is possible for the build you
have of jackwasio or wineasio will work with a crossover bottle for this
application , if so i would greatly appreciate a copy to test and report
back to you .. my email is [hidden].

you see ive got it working flawlessly except latency and i know there is a
way , im fully registered but for whatever reason the mods are slow to add
users , maybe because its so late in the game with that but ima a mover and
a thinker and i dont let much stop me . 

again Steve thank you in advance if that is at all possible 





"Yes I have tried JackWASIO.  Actually I have the original binary that is 4
years old, its not posted anywhere on the web anymore.  His src is on the
JackOSX code repository and I recently also managed to build it successfully
on Snow Leopard, after some tweaks to the Makefile."
