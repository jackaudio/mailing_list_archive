also just a shot in the dark , you wouldnt happen to have the jackwasio
crossover zip from meskalina.it would you ? the mythical solution for asio
on wine ? im stumped , been looking for 3 weeks and with certain resources
down it seem very difficult to find this particular file.. and instructions
on how to make it work ..




Yes I have tried JackWASIO.  Actually I have the original binary that is 4
years old, its not posted anywhere on the web anymore.  His src is on the
JackOSX code repository and I recently also managed to build it successfully
on Snow Leopard, after some tweaks to the Makefile.

Wineasio is more up to date and over time that codeline will be getting
general improvements related to midi perhaps and synchronization.  It would
really be a lot better for the OSX community if we can somehow benefit from
that ongoing progress instead of just using this 4 year old JackWASIO code
that nobody is interested in improving(except perhaps me).
