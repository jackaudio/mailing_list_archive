&gt; also just a shot in the dark , you wouldnt happen to have the
&gt; jackwasio crossover zip from meskalina.it would you ? the mythical
&gt; solution for asio on wine ? im stumped , been looking for 3 weeks and
&gt; with certain resources down it seem very difficult to find this
&gt; particular file.. and instructions on how to make it work ..

AFAIK, the only working ASIO code for OSX is coreasio, which is a
modified wineasio for coreaudio written by codeweavers, think it's
included in imageline's beta for osx.  Afaik, all the other wineasio
codebases do not build or work (but I might be wrong on this)..
Conceivably codeweavers would give you the coreasio sourcecode, since
wineasio is lgpl..

&gt; Yes I have tried JackWASIO.  Actually I have the original binary that
&gt; is 4 years old, its not posted anywhere on the web anymore.  His src
&gt; is on the JackOSX code repository and I recently also managed to
&gt; build it successfully on Snow Leopard, after some tweaks to the
&gt; Makefile.

Does it work?
 
&gt; Wineasio is more up to date and over time that codeline will be
&gt; getting general improvements related to midi perhaps and
&gt; synchronization.  It would really be a lot better for the OSX
&gt; community if we can somehow benefit from that ongoing progress
&gt; instead of just using this 4 year old JackWASIO code that nobody is
&gt; interested in improving(except perhaps me). 

Just a correction, there is no midi being handled by the ASIO
protocol, it was unfortunately never included by steinberg.  The only
syncronisation that can be done, is that wineasio clients sync to the
jack transport, this is done already and has been tested with several
hosts.  falktx of kxstudio fame, has made an vst plugin, that
apparently can control jack transport, but i can't remember the details.
