AFAIK, the only working ASIO code for OSX is coreasio, which is a
modified wineasio for coreaudio written by codeweavers, think it's
included in imageline's beta for osx.  Afaik, all the other wineasio
codebases do not build or work (but I might be wrong on this)..
Conceivably codeweavers would give you the coreasio sourcecode, since
wineasio is lgpl..

Does it work?

Just a correction, there is no midi being handled by the ASIO
protocol, it was unfortunately never included by steinberg.  The only
syncronisation that can be done, is that wineasio clients sync to the
jack transport, this is done already and has been tested with several
hosts.  falktx of kxstudio fame, has made an vst plugin, that
apparently can control jack transport, but i can't remember the details.
