Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [Jack-devel] Jack-Devel Digest, Vol 71, Issue 22

thanks joakim , im sorry if my message was well.. messy I meant to explain
that i have no asio access , 

and thats where im stuck , i do not have the beta and have not be selected
to test it yet .. 

 another guy steve coded a version and i was asking him for a copy , im bad
at posting in forums and mailing list .
 
 i know it really has nothing to do with the midi , just noting that the
note latency at 512ssmples is not live playable and i dont quantize a lot ..
 
im thinking basically i need a copy of the flstudio mac beta to try and if
noone has a copy they are willing to share , ill just wait my turn and try
the beta to test myself and maybe move some working components to my current
crossover flstudio bottle .

--- 

   thank you though  Joakim but specifically im looking for flstudio mac
beta or jackwasio crossover or wineasio for osx.. basically asio for my
crossover bottle which has full everything except low latency , it performs
awesomely and its a beauty besides slow responding notes.
