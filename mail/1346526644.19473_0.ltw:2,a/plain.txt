It looked like this was the case but I wanted to make sure. It looks like
the best way to handle this is with a user supplied database of
proven/tested variables or by programming the logic into the controller
app explicitly where the limitations are obvious.

This is planned for jack3 though, IIRC?

Perhaps the way around it is to only support switching sample rates if
clients that are connected signal that they are able to deal with it or if
there are no clients.
