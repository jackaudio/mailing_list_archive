hello everyone,
i am attempting to export audio from a jack slave pc running

 win7 -64bit , with jack 1.9.9 for 64bit systems (had to because I got the
AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics  error, as explained here
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.jackit/25980 )

to an audio server (jack master) with a pro audio card (based on the
ice1712 chip) which is a slackware 13.37 - 32bit, with jack 0.121.3.

I am using the wiki page
http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack (i presume this
wiki for netjack2  http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack2is
only for when both master and slave as based on jacksmp / jack2 ? please
correct me if I am wrong).

So I start portaudio with asio4all extension in windows ( I have appended
asio4all in portaudio's desktop shortcut ), and then I try to start jack
server from 'jack control' (basically qjackctl).

portaudio gives output:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack&gt;jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2"
jackdmp 1.9.9

Drivers/internals found in : C:\Windows
JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10
InitTime : multimedia timer resolution set to 1 milliseconds

and starting qjackctl straight after says that it is 'Active' and the
messages are

04:37:30.728 Patchbay deactivated.

04:37:30.756 Statistics reset.

04:37:30.774 JACK connection change.

04:37:30.779 Client activated.


basically the setup has the following bits checked: jackd (as server
prefix), realtime, no memory lock, driver: net (or netone??), verbose
messages, priority:default, port max:256, timeout: 2000msec, audio:Duplex,
chan I/O: default,default.


I get 2 capture ports and 8 playback ones (!??!!) .


finally i go to the master and start jack_netsource as:


jack_netsource -H &lt;slave_ip&gt; (i've also desperately appended the -n1 -i4
-o4 options a later trials)

it says 'Not connected' and I get 2 capture and 2 playback audio ports (and
midi too) by default.

of course the audio is not router.


If i go back and close qjackctl and jack_netsource in slave and master
respectively,

and I try to start the second jack audio server (with the net backend) from
DOS command prompt, i get the following (remember portaudio is still
working)



C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack&gt;jackd -R -d net

jackdmp 1.9.9

Drivers/internals found in : C:\Windows

`default' server already active

Failed to open server

so I'm puzzled what I do wrong.

i mean first of all i think jack and jack2 should work between different
pc's , but should I use net or netone from the jack2 slave?

at the moment none of the 2 seem to do the trick.

what else may I be doing wrong?


Thank you for your help

Thanassis
