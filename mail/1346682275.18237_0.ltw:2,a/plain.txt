Subject:     [Jack-Devel] netjack2 device discovery

Dear all,
on jackaudio.org it is said that netjack2 implements a device 
discovery through the network. How is this performed? How is it
practically obtained when invoking netjack? I couldn't find 
information about that on the internet, not even in this wiki

Regards

Leonardo
