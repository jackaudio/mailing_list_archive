Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] netjack2 device discovery

It is a complete ad-hoc mechanism with a simple connection protocol : the master module (server side) uses a multi-cast address, and listen on it. Slaves  when starting, send a "Available" packet on this address, then server send back a "parameters" packet, then slave use the "parameters" packet to configure itself and establish the real audio connection.
