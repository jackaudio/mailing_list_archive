well, this bit needs clarification:

from the netjack wiki:
Start JACK with the net backend on the slave machine
jackd -R -d net
or for jack2
jackd -R -d netone

 I pressume that the criterion to choose where to start -d net , or -d
netone , lies in what the jack master is running; since I am running jack1
(v0.121.3) on the jack master, i believe I need to run jackd -d net.

If I was running jack2 on the jack master pc as well, I believe i could use
netjack2, but since i don't i think I can not run netjack2 (so i didn't
read netjack2 wiki thoroughly).

Am i thinking this right?
