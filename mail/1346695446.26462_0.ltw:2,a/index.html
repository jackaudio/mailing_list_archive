&gt; &gt; The truth is: netone isn't implemented for Windows, so you're forced to

&gt; Correction: netone is implemented on Windows,  I think I was working
&gt; at some point, but not tested since a long time.

Let's agree on "partly", unfortunately, the relevant netjack_poll()
isn't implemented:

   https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/master/common/netjack_packet.c#L465


Which effectively prevents netone from starting on Windows. At least
that's what I saw when I tried it in a hurry. Torben has confirmed that
the code is missing and claims he has it, but as long as it remains
unmerged, I don't see how one should use netone on Windows.


Cheers
