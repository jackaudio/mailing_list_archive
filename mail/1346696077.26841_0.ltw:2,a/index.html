&gt;&gt;&gt; The truth is: netone isn't implemented for Windows, so you're forced to
&gt;&gt;&gt; netjack2, which means you're forced to jackd2 on the master as well.
&gt;&gt; Correction: netone is implemented on Windows,  I think I was working
&gt;&gt; at some point, but not tested since a long time.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's agree on "partly", unfortunately, the relevant netjack_poll()
&gt; isn't implemented:
&gt; 
&gt;  https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/master/common/netjack_packet.c#L465

There is only a single call to netjack_poll(). Maybe it's possible to
convert this to netjack_poll_deadline(), too, which is already
implemented.

OTOH, maybe the POSIX version of netjack_poll() also works on WIN32. If
so, the fix would be to move the function outside the #ifdef.

I don't have no Windows development environment, so I cannot test it.
