Unless someone has a solution for why jack slave with the net backend does
not even start giving this message about default server being busy (when
port audio is  running already), then I have no choice but to install jack
2 even on my master.

I mean, from what you write it seems to me that I did the correct procedure.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The truth is: netone isn't implemented for Windows, so you're forced to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; netjack2, which means you're forced to jackd2 on the master as well.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Correction: netone is implemented on Windows,  I think I was working
&gt; &gt;&gt; at some point, but not tested since a long time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let's agree on "partly", unfortunately, the relevant netjack_poll()
&gt; &gt; isn't implemented:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/master/common/netjack_packet.c#L465
&gt;
&gt; There is only a single call to netjack_poll(). Maybe it's possible to
&gt; convert this to netjack_poll_deadline(), too, which is already
&gt; implemented.
&gt;
&gt; OTOH, maybe the POSIX version of netjack_poll() also works on WIN32. If
&gt; so, the fix would be to move the function outside the #ifdef.
&gt;
&gt; I don't have no Windows development environment, so I cannot test it.
