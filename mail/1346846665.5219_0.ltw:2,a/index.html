hello everyone again,
i'm afraid i'll have to bother you once again about transporting sound
between 2 pcs.

So I went ahead and compiled the jack2 (jackdmp) for my jack master pc as
well.
So now I have at both ends jack2 running ( slackware linux 32bit jack
master, and a win7-64bit jack slave ).
There is no firewall run on any of these 2 pcs. (there is a firewall
running on a gateway pc, but i pressume a multicast packet you still be
able to fly through the intranet. correct?)

once both jack2 where running, i followed the netjack2 wiki
http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack2
 so i start the Net manager as

'jack_load netmanager' in the jack server and get the output:

nass@starbase:~$ jack_load netmanager
netmanager is running.
client name = netmanager

which is good news i guess (no netjack capture/playback ports appear quite
yet - but i guess thats expected).

Then I go to the client and try run the following command from a DOS prompt:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack&gt;jackd.exe -R -d net

and I get the output

jackdmp 1.9.9

Waiting for a master...

AS such the client again, doesn't appear on the server side.....

Any suggestions?
Has anydoby managed to connect these 2 systems? (a linux master and a
windows slave that is? )

Thank you in advance for your help
nass

&gt; Unless someone has a solution for why jack slave with the net backend does
&gt; not even start giving this message about default server being busy (when
&gt; port audio is  running already), then I have no choice but to install jack
&gt; 2 even on my master.
&gt;
&gt; I mean, from what you write it seems to me that I did the correct
&gt; procedure.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The truth is: netone isn't implemented for Windows, so you're forced
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; netjack2, which means you're forced to jackd2 on the master as well.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Correction: netone is implemented on Windows,  I think I was working
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at some point, but not tested since a long time.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Let's agree on "partly", unfortunately, the relevant netjack_poll()
&gt;&gt; &gt; isn't implemented:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/master/common/netjack_packet.c#L465
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There is only a single call to netjack_poll(). Maybe it's possible to
&gt;&gt; convert this to netjack_poll_deadline(), too, which is already
&gt;&gt; implemented.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; OTOH, maybe the POSIX version of netjack_poll() also works on WIN32. If
&gt;&gt; so, the fix would be to move the function outside the #ifdef.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't have no Windows development environment, so I cannot test it.
