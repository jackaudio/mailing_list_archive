Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] can't connect audio between two computers

hello everyone again,
i'm afraid i'll have to bother you once again about transporting sound
between 2 pcs.

So I went ahead and compiled the jack2 (jackdmp) for my jack master pc as
well.
So now I have at both ends jack2 running ( slackware linux 32bit jack
master, and a win7-64bit jack slave ).
There is no firewall run on any of these 2 pcs. (there is a firewall
running on a gateway pc, but i pressume a multicast packet you still be
able to fly through the intranet. correct?)

once both jack2 where running, i followed the netjack2 wiki
http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack2
 so i start the Net manager as

'jack_load netmanager' in the jack server and get the output:

nass@starbase:~$ jack_load netmanager
netmanager is running.
client name = netmanager

which is good news i guess (no netjack capture/playback ports appear quite
yet - but i guess thats expected).

Then I go to the client and try run the following command from a DOS prompt:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack>jackd.exe -R -d net

and I get the output

jackdmp 1.9.9

AS such the client again, doesn't appear on the server side.....

Any suggestions?
Has anydoby managed to connect these 2 systems? (a linux master and a
windows slave that is? )

Thank you in advance for your help
nass
