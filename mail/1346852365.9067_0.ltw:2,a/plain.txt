Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Only 4 channel with Allen & Heath 4D

Hi,

I have one problem with my configuration on Jack Audio.

I am running the 1.9.9 version on Win 7 64 Bit, trying to route Traktor
into Ableton Live

I open jack portaudio, then jack control, and I set up 8 ( or 10 ) channels
, as my Xone 4D soundcard has 10 channels.

When I open Traktor, I set Jackrouter as Audio card, then when I try to
make the 8 channel out, I can only pick up channel 1 and 2 and 3 and 4....

How can I make more than 4 channel output and input?

Thanks
