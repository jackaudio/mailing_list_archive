Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fedora 17

Installed, set up, and running rtirq, .. sitation is not really better, but its possibly around the problem. Pleas see the post here:

>> rtirq is now in the proper Fedora repos
I could not find such a package, with yum/yumex. Installed an rpm.

So far, no success. Nothing works with Jack at the moment for me, for any of my sound cards.

I keep on fighting, and I don't really want to give up, .. but I don't see a strategy how to narrow down the problem.

Thanks Jeremy - rtirq is now in the proper Fedora repos (was in CCRMA 
before).

István, let me know how you go - the nature of the package means its not 
going to work out of the box for all hardware, but I'd love to get your 
feedback on it (I'm maintaining it in Fedora).

But seriously, raise a bug and others can benefit
