Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] can't connect audio between two computers

right,
so installed v1.9.8 32bit, and still its waiting for a master if i run the
command

jackd.exe -S -R -d net

i am also using iptraf
and i can monitor packets on the network.
so  i can see that the slave pc is sending out on port 19000, to
225.3.19.154:19000 udp packets.

so i can imagine the slave sends what it must. still it doesn't connect to
the server.
