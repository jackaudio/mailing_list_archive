Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fedora 17

The configuration has almost perfect status. It works for a few seconds, on a lucky run it runs for over a minute, .. therefore I think it is most likely a bug, or a system-configuration issue, that does not prevent Jack and the soundcard from running, but it does not work seamlessly as expected. when the struggle starts, it is on a low-level, .. not a latency/period issue, or anything that can be tuned in QJackCtl. IMO.


The two key point we hold in hand here - in my opinion: 

- The Transport, eg. the Timeline, slows down / struggles as well, in Ardour, but not in Rosegarden, whereby both produce the same error-sound-effect.

- Pulseaudio uses the ALSA driver perfectly. I can listen to radio on VLC for hours, without any issues. 


Should an issue with IRQ's and such not affect Pulseaudio as well?



@Chris:
>>If the original system description was sent to this list, I missed it.  

I came from the Ardour forum, when I realized that this is a jack issue, and not an Ardour issue.


>>Is the original poster running a -rt kernel, or a custom compiled kernel?
 
I'm the original poster, having the issue, .. It is a default fedora kernel, .. I have now 3 of them. Latest is 3.5.3-1.fc17.x86_64 ...
in general all packages except Ardour 3 Beta are Fedora packages, .. from default repo's, or rpmfusion, ...

Here some spec's:
15.6 GiB Memory, Intel® Core™ i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz × 8, Asus P8H67 board, 

We are dealing with the Echo audio gina24 sound card primary. on Alsa-level it works like a charm. Echomixer 1.0.5 works, I see the metering.

As far as I see, threadirqs seems to work.

Here is the thread on Ardour forums, that has more detailed info's. http://ardour.org/node/5434#comment-30073


@Brendan

Pulse audio seems to be irrelevant. It is the same even with Pulseaudio uninstalled.

It does not matter if it is hw:0 hw:0,0 or hw:Gina24 ... I gave all versions a try, and all behave the same.

@Jeremy

With the nVidia drivers completely uninstalled, nouveau drivers take the spot, and take the same IRQ. Same error-effect.





Is there a way to playback a wave file with Jack in init-3? Without having any desktop, just a root console?


Thanks for all tips and tricks.

If the original system description was sent to this list, I missed it.  Is
the original poster running a -rt kernel, or a custom compiled kernel?

The standard Fedora kernel is not compiled with preemption enabled, and if
I understand correctly the threadirqs kernel parameter does not have an
effect unless the kernel was configured with preemption enabled (also
labeled as low latency configuration, or perhaps low latency desktop, I
forget the exact wording in the description).
