Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: Σχετ: New Windows 1.9.9.4 installers

Thank you Stephane,
i'll be making a slackbuild for the v1.9.9.4  and testing it between linux
32bit , and windows7 64bits, just to make sure.

It should be noted that connecting jack1 and jack2 is impossible - which is
what i initially was trying to do.
I thought that this was not a problem, as jack2 can be a drop in
replacement for jack1, i was wrong - but perhaps it should be explicitly
written in the wiki.

Other than that thank you all for this great sound server!:)

Panos, should you need anything don't hesitate to contact me!
