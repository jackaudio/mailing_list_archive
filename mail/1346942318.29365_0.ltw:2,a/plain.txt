Follow-Up:   Paul Davis Re: [Jack-Devel] Fedora 17 (1346942605.29749_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fedora 17

I was able to playback from console with the command: 

cvlc --jack-auto-connect file:///home/x/test.wav

.. it struggles, ofc, as all other applications. (jackd -r -d alsa -d hw:Gina24   .. gave no errors in the console)

@Jeremy mplayer seems to be complied without jack in Fedora. .. but thanks to the suggestion, I try ed it, ..


@Paul

I think you probably meant http://alsa.opensrc.org/.asoundrc

[root@casino ~]# locate asoundrc
/usr/share/doc/alsa-lib-1.0.25/asoundrc.txt

.. I don't have such a file, but as I read on the wiki, I don't need one, ..

Some interesting files are:
/etc/asound.conf
.. empty, only a comment: # Place your global alsa-lib configuration here...


/var/lib/alsa/asound.state
.. seems to describe the current state of all soundcard's.


The script that generates asoundrc from the wiki created: 


pcm.NVidia { type hw; card NVidia; }
ctl.NVidia { type hw; card NVidia; }
pcm.Gina24 { type hw; card Gina24; }
ctl.Gina24 { type hw; card Gina24; }
pcm.External { type hw; card External; }
ctl.External { type hw; card External; }
pcm.U0x46d0x8c9 { type hw; card U0x46d0x8c9; }
ctl.U0x46d0x8c9 { type hw; card U0x46d0x8c9; }
pcm.!default pcm.Gina24
ctl.!default ctl.Gina24



>> system:playback_1 


I could not find any files with find-in-files techniques that are responsible for this naming. I guess this must happen in some in binary form, ..



By the way, the system feels like it is responding a little bit slower, when jack is running in any form. (Console characters appear with some latency :)




Open to any suggestions, ...

you appear to be trying to use a ~/.asoundrc file that defines ports with names like alsa_pcm:playback_1

this is wrong. the names should be system:playback_1 

that may not be your only problem. i suggest you post your ~/.asoundrc file and/or compare it to the one in the JACK FAQ at http://jackaudio.org/faq
