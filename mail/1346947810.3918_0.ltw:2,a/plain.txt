Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fedora 17

I set up the rawjack as described there, with the default device settings. Rebooted.

[x@casino ~]$ aplay -D pcm.jack /home/x/test.wav
ALSA lib pcm_plug.c:1273:(_snd_pcm_plug_open) Unknown field playback_ports
aplay: main:682: audio open error: Invalid argument

 .. same error with aplay, if jack is running or not. unfortunately that error does not say to me too much.


[x@casino ~]$ aplay /home/x/test32s.wav
jack_client_new: deprecated
Playing WAVE '/home/x/test32s.wav' : Float 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Stereo


Is playing back the wave file with the struggle-error-effect, .. only when jack is running.

I was experimenting a little with VLC and it's output setting. If jack is in between, the struggle error always show's up, unless jack is not running, but I guess that is VLC's fallback to default, and not that rawjack route.




If I understand your suggestion right, this would be a routing technique, to get over possible naming problems. I'm not sure this is relevant.
After a reboot, starting jack, starting VLC with Jack output, playback was smooth as it suppose to be for exactly 28 seconds. Then struggle, and struggle and struggle, ...for me appears te be more like a bug, then an incorrect routing-naming issue.

In theory, I should use the Gina24 directly, no?



I uploaded a sample wave-file that I recorded from the Gina's output while playing back just the tick and then a wave file with Ardour, and uploaded some sample alsa-info.txt files as well.

For me intresting looks this:
[ 1030.548002] ALSA sound/pci/echoaudio/echoaudio_dsp.c:850 start_transport 10001
[ 1087.070791] IRQ 16 might be stuck.  Polling

.. if this would be a lottery, I would tip for a bug somwhere on that IRQ-soundcard-driver-jack level.


Please correct me if I'm wrong.
