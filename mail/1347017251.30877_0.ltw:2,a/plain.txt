Funny, I had not seen this email when starting work on it :)
Anyway, there are two problems:

1) opus_encode() will not always result in a fixed length.
 In particular if the input is silent or if the bitrate is large,
fCompressedSizeByte will be less than the max possible.

To work arount this I use the first 4 bytes of the actual payload to
transmit the fCompressedSizeByte per channel - I have not yet committed
that patch.

Would this be the way to go? Any better alternatives?


2) netjack currently uses opus-custom. the debian package does not [yet]
include that (see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=686777).

This issue has spawned quite some discussion on IRC #opus.

In short: non-custom (aka normal) opus modes will only work on
buffersizes 120, 240,.. samples (motivated by 5ms phone latency).
Power-of-two and block-sizes < 120 samples do requires custom modes.

Although most agree that nejack is a valid use-case for opus
custom-modes, upstream is reluctant to enable custom-modes by default,
because it breaks interoperability and the concern is that many people
will use them to lazily port their celt (which used power-of-two
blocksizes) code.

A drawback from custom-mode is that compression is not as good as it can
be (it has not been optimized). It was suggested to have netjack use
normal modes if custom is not available.

This would work in general but require buffering inside jackd and add
additional latency.. I'm somewhat reluctant to go that way. Comments?

best,
robin

PS. The initial work on this was done for netjack2 only. Once the dust
has settled, updating netjack1/netone will be easy.
