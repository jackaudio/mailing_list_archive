&gt;&gt; opus_encode() will not always result in a fixed length.
&gt;&gt; In particular if the input is silent or if the bitrate is large,
&gt;&gt; fCompressedSizeByte will be less than the max possible.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; To work arount this I use the first 4 bytes of the actual payload to
&gt;&gt; transmit the fCompressedSizeByte per channel - I have not yet committed
&gt;&gt; that patch.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Would this be the way to go? Any better alternatives?
&gt; 
&gt; Seems reasonable.

OK.

&gt;&gt; Although most agree that nejack is a valid use-case for opus
&gt;&gt; custom-modes, upstream is reluctant to enable custom-modes by default,
&gt;&gt; because it breaks interoperability
&gt; 
&gt; In what way?

In principle every opus stream should be playable with any other opus
application e.g. firefox.

IMHO this is a non-issue, because netjack's protocol is not intended to
inter-operate with anything except other jack instances, anyway.


&gt;&gt; A drawback from custom-mode is that compression is not as good as it can
&gt;&gt; be (it has not been optimized).
&gt; 
&gt; But will it be at some point?

I don't know. It does not seem to be high priority. AFAIU some of the
experimental improvements are also tied to the fixed frame-rates.


&gt; I think we should clearly avoid degrading the performances (and
&gt; adding code complexity with any buffering scheme..) because of this
&gt; kind of reasons.  Going from CELT to Opus is not "our" choice, so we
&gt; should keep pushing to keep the best we can.


The question boils down to this:

  A)  use standard opus modes
     + makes some opus-devs and packagers happy
     - adds latency
     - adds code-complexity to jack (re-framing to N*120 frames)
     + possibly improved compressed sound-quality

  B) use opus custom-modes.
     - may not be available on all systems
       (requires libopus to be compiled with --enable-custom-modes)
     + no additional latency
     + simple code in jack
     - possibly substandard compression quality
       (should still be better than celt, though)


I'm leaning towards (B). Favor simplicity and fixed low latency over
quality when using compression. -- Users who require high-quality or
loss-less transmission won't be using Celt, Opus or whatever, anyway.

(A) Re-framing the buffers, modifying the port-latencies on netjack, etc
are no complicated tasks per se. ..but taking care of all details and
integration is certainly not trivial.

PS Here are some excerpts of the IRC discussion on #celt

14:55 &lt; rgareus&gt; Hi. Is there any reason why debian's libopus comes
without '--enable-custom-modes' ?
[..]
15:22 &lt; Garf&gt; why does jack need custom modes to begin with?
15:22 &lt; rgareus&gt; Garf: because it has a fixed frame/period cycle.
15:23 &lt; rgareus&gt; and the frames/period is usually a power of two.
15:25 &lt; Garf&gt; why should opus have to care about that?
15:25 &lt; Garf&gt; this reeks of serious misdesign elsewhere
15:25 &lt; ron_&gt; mostly to (try and) avoid the risk of people who shouldn't
be using custom modes using them anyway because of a misunderstanding
15:27 &lt;+derf&gt; Well, the point of opus-custom is for cases where you're
not trying to interoperate with anyone else, and don't need any of the
voice modes.
15:27 &lt; rgareus&gt; netjack is pretty much isolated. it only talks to other
jackd instances.
[..]
15:36 &lt;+derf&gt; rgareus: Well, as I said, you reframe things from 256
samples or whatever to 240 samples, and add 10 ms of delay.
[..]
15:42 &lt;+derf&gt; The lowest standard Opus supports at all is 5 ms.
[..]
15:44 &lt;+derf&gt; 120 sample frame size + 120 sample overlap + 56 sample
reframing buffer.
[..]
15:50 &lt; rgareus&gt; Am I understanding it correctly that the only downside
of --enable-custom-modes in the deb package would be, that some API
users would abuse it and thereby break compatibility?
15:50 &lt;+gmaxwell&gt; opus custom also loses most of the exp encoder
enhancements. It's worth making an effort to not use it.
15:51 &lt;+derf&gt; And it's nowhere near as well tested.
[..]
[..]
22:17 &lt;+bemasc&gt; rgareus: For 64-sample frames, I think the minimum
additional latency of Opus would be 232 samples, compared to 64 in
opus-custom, or a difference of 168 samples = 3.5ms.  If you think it's
worth losing your chance at compatibility with a whole universe of
standard Opus decoders (e.g. every copy of Firefox), then you should use
opus-custom.
[..]
22:43 &lt; rgareus&gt; bemasc: netjack's data stream is not intended to
interoperate with any other application, least of all browsers. It is
used to bridge JACK (as in http://jackaudio.org) servers over a network.
Apart from audio-data, the netjack protocol includes MIDI, transport
information (SMPTE and Bar-beat-tick,..) and other jack-settings such as
port-latencies,..
[..]
22:49 &lt;+bemasc&gt; rgareus: Cool.  FYI, standard Opus is designed to be
able to do a lot of these things, like synchronized massively
multichannel streams (over RTP).
22:49 &lt; rgareus&gt; celt-custom worked fine.. until debian decided to drop
celt :) hence this work on replacing it with opus.
22:50 &lt;+bemasc&gt; Interop may not be on the roadmap now, but I maintain
that it might make sense.  For example, I hope that live concert mixing
systems from different vendors will eventually interoperate over
multichannel Opus-RTP.
22:52 &lt;+bemasc&gt; There's even an RTP mapping for MIDI!
[..]
23:31 &lt; jmspeex&gt; About netjack, I honestly think it's a good reason for
using opus-costom
