- celt is no longer maintained and has been deprecated upstream.
- opus is the successor of CELT. CELT has been merged into Opus.

(CELT was likely dropped early to force people to adopt Opus)

The problem we have is that libcelt comes with "--enable-custom-modes"
by default, but libopus does not -- Otherwise there are no disadvantages
of using Opus.

re "custom modes": https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusFAQ#What_is_Opus_Custom.3F
(they allow block-sizes other than multiples of 2.5 ms)

The main disadvantage of CELT is its limited bitrate range:
CELT: 32 kb/s to 128 kb/s
Opus:  6 kb/s to 510 kb/s

Opus adds support for VBR.  Bitrate, bandwidth and frame-sizes can call
be adjusted dynamically. The quality has apparently improved, too, but I
have not done direct comparisons nor measurements on that myself.

I only checked out the examples at http://opus-codec.org/examples/ --
well actually I attended Tim's presentation of it at FOMS earlier this
week where he played them.

It is an option, but there is no gain - except that there'd be no new
code needed. Yet /upgrading/ from CELT to Opus is pretty much a
s/celt_/opus_/g and Opus performs much better (less CPU, better
compression or better quality at same bitrate).
