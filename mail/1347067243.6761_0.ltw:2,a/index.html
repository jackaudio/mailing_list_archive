&gt; &gt; Some naive questions come to mind:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  * Why did Debian decide to stop packaging CELT?
&gt;
&gt; - celt is no longer maintained and has been deprecated upstream.
&gt; - opus is the successor of CELT. CELT has been merged into Opus.
&gt;
&gt; (CELT was likely dropped early to force people to adopt Opus)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  * What are the advantages and disadvantages of CELT vs. Opus?
&gt;
&gt; The problem we have is that libcelt comes with "--enable-custom-modes"
&gt; by default, but libopus does not -- Otherwise there are no disadvantages
&gt; of using Opus.
&gt;
&gt; re "custom modes": https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusFAQ#What_is_Opus_Custom.3F
&gt; (they allow block-sizes other than multiples of 2.5 ms)
&gt;
&gt; The main disadvantage of CELT is its limited bitrate range:
&gt; CELT: 32 kb/s to 128 kb/s
&gt; Opus:  6 kb/s to 510 kb/s
&gt;
&gt; Opus adds support for VBR.  Bitrate, bandwidth and frame-sizes can call
&gt; be adjusted dynamically. The quality has apparently improved, too, but I
&gt; have not done direct comparisons nor measurements on that myself.
&gt; http://opus-codec.org/comparison/quality.svg
&gt; I only checked out the examples at http://opus-codec.org/examples/ --
&gt; well actually I attended Tim's presentation of it at FOMS earlier this
&gt; week where he played them.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  * If JACK ends up packaging and distributing the library, anyway, is
&gt; &gt; it an option to continue using CELT?
&gt;
&gt; It is an option, but there is no gain - except that there'd be no new
&gt; code needed. Yet /upgrading/ from CELT to Opus is pretty much a
&gt; s/celt_/opus_/g and Opus performs much better (less CPU, better
&gt; compression or better quality at same bitrate).

OK, thanks Robin.

That's what I figured, but didn't know.
