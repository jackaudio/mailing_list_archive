Hello everyone. First, apologies if this has been answered elsewhere, I
couldn't find anything after a lot of searching.

I'm trying to get jack2 to run on a Raspberry Pi running "Raspian" which,
for those not familiar with the project, is a distro based on Debian Wheezy
and targeted at the Pi's ARM architecture. I tried installing jack2 with a
simple apt-get install, but Jack failed to run because it "couldn't
allocate memory". I can give you more details on that error if you're
interested, but I thought it best given the unique architecture of the
Raspberry Pi to just compile from scratch.

I removed the jack2 I had installed from apt, got the latest jack2 source
from github, did a "./waf configure --alsa --prefix=/usr", then "./waf
build", and finally "./waf install".

At that point, jackd started up happily for me and said something helpful
about using a different kind of memory (sorry, don't remember specifically,
maybe System V?). I logged out and left the project for a few days.

When I logged in again, though, I could not get jackd to run, and though I
have tried many things, I cannot get past this error:

root@raspberrypi:/usr/lib# jackd -d net
jackdmp 1.9.9.4
Copyright 2001-2005 Paul Davis and others.

jackd: symbol lookup error: jackd: undefined symbol: jackctl_driver_get_type

I've tried running ldconfig a few times, I've made sure the libraries are
installed to /usr/lib, etc. and I can't seem to get it to work. The fact
that it ran once, in the same terminal session that I first compiled it
under, makes me think it's a path problem, but I don't have enough
experience working with shared libraries on Linux to figure it out.

Any ideas on what I could try at this point? I realize you probably need
more details than this - let me know what commands to run and I'll share
the output.

Thanks.
