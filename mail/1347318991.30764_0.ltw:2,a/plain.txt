Subject:     [Jack-Devel] libjack naming on Windows 64

Hi All,

I'm just working on tidying up a new release of JNAJack (Java -> JACK
binding) [1] and noticed that it isn't working correctly on Windows 64
with a 64bit JVM.  This seems to be because it tries to link with
libjack by default.  Linking with libjack64 instead seems to fix this.
 Is this always the name of the correct lib on Windows 64 (now and
future)?  Is there a reason for the different lib name?  I'm assuming
it's something to do with supporting 32bit and 64 bit in the same
package?

Feel free to point me to an obvious link if I've missed one! ;-)

Thanks and best wishes,

Neil
