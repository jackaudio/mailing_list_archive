Hi St&#xE9;phane,

Thanks for your email

&gt;

LOL.  I don't think I'll worry too much about that yet - doesn't feel
like a release blocker! :-)


&gt;&gt; Is there a reason for the different lib name?  I'm assuming
&gt;&gt; it's something to do with supporting 32bit and 64 bit in the same
&gt;&gt; package?
&gt;
&gt; Exactly. Same as on Linux.
&gt;

Is it?  Isn't this done with different library paths and not suffixes
on Linux?  I've not seen a libjack64.so - is this a possibility?
JNAJack uses JNA which in turn uses libffi to dynamically link at
runtime.  It searches the library path by name (automatically handling
the optional lib prefix and .so / .dll suffix).  It won't search
libname64 by itself though, so I was initially going to handle this
exception on Windows 64 only.  Should I be dealing with this
possibility on all platforms?

&gt; On OSX Apple gives a way to "pack" several different architectures in a same binary (libraries or exec...) and this is transparent. But this nice feature has not been followed on other OS...
&gt;

Would be good.  Multiarch feels a baby step in the right direction.

&gt;
&gt; PS: better to test with latest beta 1.9.9 (4) package on Windows if possible....

On my list (how did you know I wasn't?! :-) )  I want to make sure
it's working with the current download first - it's likely to be the
one that users are using right now(?).

Thanks and best wishes,

Neil
