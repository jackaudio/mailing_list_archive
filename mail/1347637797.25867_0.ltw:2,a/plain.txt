Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [ANN] JAudioLibs (JNAJack) build:120912

Hi All,

A new build of JAudioLibs is now available for download, including
improvements to the JNAJack Java bindings for JACK.  Primarily this
adds support for client and port registration callbacks, port
connection callbacks, graph reorder callbacks and querying port
connections. A huge thank you to Chuck Ritola for providing the bulk
of this code.
