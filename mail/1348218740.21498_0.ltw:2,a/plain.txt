Hi Stephane and all

Report on Jack for windows 1.9.9.4 x64.

Un-installed earlier 1.9.9 then installed the new one.
All OK, fast and accurate.

Set the classic (for me...) -p 128 -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2" -r 48000 and went for checking audio.
On board RealTek card, 24/48000.

OK crystal - I used the latest Independence 3.1 pro x64 from Magix which I had updated from 3.0 just before installing Jack 1.9.9.4.
Also all went OK when mixing a 32bit app, like SampleTank 2.5. No issues here, also sending audio to Cantabile, Reaper 4, MuLab 4, MtStudioLite, also adding Kontakt 5, EWQL Free Symphony Orch Reaktor, ect ect.

The issue arises when tried to use the usual (for me...) Savihosted VST reverbs....
Here distorted sound came and stopped when the reverb's release stopped. Not possible to play, only when disconnected Savi. The main Instrument was OK and clear, not affected.
All my VST reverbs that are made as standalones with Savihost No Kbd had the same issue.
Also all VST instruments with Savihost.

So, I thought it is Savihost (1.40.1 x86 & x64 ), so I opened the standalone Rev Pro 1. No luck the same here...
My last try was the Guitar RIG x64 standalone latest version.
Here all went OK and got a great sound, not the slightest click !

I don't know why this happened. Jack's command prompt showed nothing, not a single error.
Usually when I overdo things with Inde and load CPU, Jack always warns me about the issue, before the crash happens, or the distorted sound from such overloads, like "..engine now will behave abnormally" ect (one of the reasons I love Jack.... it predicts the future ! LOL)

With 1.9.9 had no such issue with all savihosted apps (instruments or FX).

Is not big issue for me, as those big samplers have their own FX on board and Jack mixes them great.
For my PipeOrgan's setups (GrandOrgue x64, jOrgan x64 +Jack + SaviFX) where I saved some settings , I'll have to use Jack with Guitar Rig x64 and re-program the environments.

It will be though (if this happens elsewhere too) for all those windows users I know on different forums, mainly organists, who use Jack for adding Reverb and other FX (like Mr,Donald Leslie sim) to their GrandOrgue and/or jOrgan setups already made and enjoy :-)

Any ideas?


Best
Panos
