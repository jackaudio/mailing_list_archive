Hi Erik ,

Hi Stephane ,

OK, I saw the problem : Stephane was right. Changing -p 128 to -p 256 gave a clean sound from ANY Savihosted VST.

QJackctl though stays at 128/48000.... (?) - my settings from previous -p 128.
Asio control panel shows the blue "footprint" of buffer setting fader at 256 even if it's set at 128 (?).


Now, why's that, probably is something from Savihost (either x86 or x64), because any commercial or any trial/free player from them is behaving excellently with -p 128 -r 48000 and latency is down to 5ms !!!

Also Jack portaudio screen doesn't show any warnings or errors (when at -p 128). Nothing, just the black screen after the default text.

I'm not complaining, because I wanted to reduce if possible to zero all savihosted VST, as they work better in Reaper, and Jack can connect and send HQ audio from the apps I want into Reaper. 


Also from my latest test, GrandOrgue x64 and Guitar Rig x64 (Reflektor+EQ/Comp ect) give me the heavenly sound I like at -p 128 :-) 

So, one can say that I'm super fine.

As a result for the windows users though, I can say that 256 buffers is the down limit for Savihosted VST, unless a more powerful OS with the latest i5 , i7 Ivy Bridge (here Pentium T4400 2.2GHz Dual core 4$GB ram), can easy go to 128 with Savi. Dunno...

Two software remain to be tested, jOrgan/FS-Portaudio>Asio>Jack and the mighty Linuxsampler

I got many of my shared jOrgan dispositions with an alternative dispo file for work with Jack.
Indeed I got Graham's extensions and I got them without Jack 1.9.8, simply because 1.9.8 was already installed here then :-)

I don't think it won't work... as Graham's 1.1.4 Fluidsynth extensions designed for jOrgan 3.14, work with no issues for jOrgan 3.17 !

So, wait a little, I'll do now this test (jOrgan 3.17 FS/Graham's 1.1.4-Asio>Jack 1.9.9.4 all win7 x64)
and post asap

Panos

Hello Panos,

I see that you are testing the new version  Jack_v1.9.9.4 for
    Windows.
I am staying currently with Jack_v1.9.8 SVN4384 because this is the
    version bundled in Graham's package libfluidsynth1.1.4-Jack1.9.8_x86_64.zip
This package contains the native Jack driver, allowing
    multi-sound-source with fluidsynth using the included files
    libfluidsynth.dll and libjack64.dll.
If i remember correctly, later versions of Jack did not work with
    the native driver.
Does the very latest Jack version you are testing work with these 2
    files?

Thanks in advance for your answer.

All the best.

Erik.
