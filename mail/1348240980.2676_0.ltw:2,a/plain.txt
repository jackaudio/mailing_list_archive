OK GOOD NEWS !

Jack 1.9.9.4 for windows (x64) works with no issues with jOrgan 3.17 x64 with Fluidsynth engine and Graham's portaudio extensions (1.1.4 x64, Asio)

It was so easy Erik. 

Opened jack, then jOrgan and loaded my latest and small ( to speed up FS loading samples) Leach Purcell organ disposition.
This was saved with jOrgan 3.16 and Portaudio/Asio.

In construction mode on Fluidsynth element already was set 8/128 buffers, 48000Hz.
Changed driver for Portaudio from Asio4all to Jackrouter.
Waited a few seconds and then I returned to play mode.
Sound ! Free and HQ.... 

It's far better when jOrgan/FS is alone with windows Direct sound (with DS I'm forced to use 8/256 buffers to get a clean sound without cracks...)

So.... How better can we get ?? :-D 

I'll post on jOrgan list too, for any user who wants to upgrade to 3.17 and wants to use the latest Jack 1.9.9.4.

With Jack any "poor" sounding disposition can sound pro HQ.
We must thank Stephane for windows' Jack versions and Graham for his excellent extensions !

Next and last the Linuxsampler. Though I have no doubts that it will work as expected.


I attach here the file with which I tested for anyone who wants it.
Ah, and the free Purcell organ (so it will work...) is here :
