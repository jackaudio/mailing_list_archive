so hello again,
so more news on transporting sound back and forth between linux and windows

i did install jack2 - 1.9.9.4 on both ends (32bits on both ends)

things work smoothly.
i carry 8C + 8P channels back and forth without any problem.

i do get some clicks and stuff when i see these messages in the server:

Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
Connection is not synched, skip cycle...

and in client: (i get these both with and w/o "-dnet -l10"  - thats for
latency and i tried it as Staphane requested)

ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1302707770
Packet(s) missing from... -1 1
NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 149686076
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1308103740
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1758646842
Packet(s) missing from... -1 1
NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1603161786

i also get a few XRUNS on the jack server (in linux) but these vanish if i
switch from -p128 to -p256.

i also tried -S option for Sync in : client only, both client and server.

hydrogen takes too long to start playing (it stops immidiately though).
once hydrogen is rolling, jack server also says rolling - there is no way
to start the jack server rolling from qjackctl play button.
on the jack client side, i can roll freely from qjackctl, but it does not
start/stop anything in either the client side (i have FL studio running),
nor on the server side.

that's pretty much my findings. For audio processing this is great (16
channels of audio is rather massive for home DAW)

On a side note:
im also trying to get sound from amSynth and try to control it through midi
virtual keyboard. bammer.
i compiled and installed 2 virtual keyboards. jack - keyboard and vkeybd.
the former shows up in midi connections tab, and i can connect it to
amSynth. But i can hear no sound - it is as if  the signals never reach am
synth.
The latter, i can't even see it in midi connections pane...

I'm sure i've seen screenshots in the internet of vkeybd showing up in
jack..
anything i am missing about how to start (perhpas) keybd in order for it to
show up?
other soft synths that you suggest i try (so as to verify virtual midi
connectivity can produce sound).

Last but not least.
I would like to run more than one qjackctl (and jackd) on the jack master
pc (linux). it seems impossible unless i open separate terminals and export
the variable $JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER as a difference value in each.

Then i can start a different qjackctl from each terminal. but i will not
get any ports (apart from system) showing up. basically, i'd expect the
windows jack client to show up in at least one of them (they both run
"jack_load netmanager" as a post jackd startup command).

Also i have set virtual alsa devices  (cloop and ploop - through an init
script called loop2jack, see here
http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge) so
as to route all sound from my desktop appz through one of the these running
jack instances on my linux jack master.

if i'm running a single qjackctl all the above will show up nicely, but not
if i run 2 sessions. is it possible to have clients show up in either of
the sessions? if it possible to  share audio, between different instances?

The reason i ask is because i have 2 audio cards on my DAW. one is prof
audio card and the other, the onboard soundcard. I would still like to add
some effect in the onboard soundcard, which i'll use to pass desktop sound
through.

I can not use the pro audio card for jackified desktop appz sound, because
 XRUNS are generated if i use the ploop and cloop alsa devices with low
jack server frame settings (-p128 and -p256). so redirecting the desktop
sound to another soundcard (through another jack) would be awesome. is it
possible?

Thank you for your help!
Nass

&gt;
&gt; &gt; ok so some quite first findings,
&gt; &gt; disclaimer: this is the very first time i'm attempting this so most
&gt; probably i need to tweak numbers and stuff to make it sing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ok first the versions and such:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -my home network is based on a cheap gigabit switch. there is not too
&gt; much traffic. I have server running linux, that hosts several services on
&gt; the intranet and also is the internet gateway. internallly from the
&gt; gateway/file server there is the gigabit switch and a small 100Mbit wifi
&gt; access point. there exist 2 more pcs and a laptop. at the time of running.
&gt; The server and the 2 pcs were on.
&gt; &gt; Also, the services run internally, include, dhcp , dns, ntpd... i hope
&gt; this is not a hell of traffic.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -jack server: v1.9.8 (sorry no time to install 1.9.9.4 - i'll do that
&gt; when i get back in 10 days), on a linux 32bit
&gt; &gt; -jack client: v1.9.8 - 32bit executable , win7 -64bit,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -connected using netjack2, as described in the wiki for netjack2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -I did only audio testing, no midi (sorry - no kb pressent - i could use
&gt; a virtual kb if someone could give me a how to in order to understand midi
&gt; in linux -raw/seq )
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -the master starts with this params:
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -ok a possible bug i think i identified:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -I can not start the slave jack (in windows) from qjackctl. the slave
&gt; qjackctl tries to start jack with the following line:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 02:00:27.098 jackd.exe -S -R -t200 -dnet -r48000 -p1024
&gt; &gt; 02:00:27.145 JACK was started with PID=47748568.
&gt; &gt; 02:00:27.285 Could not connect to JACK server as client. - Overall
&gt; operation failed. - Unable to connect to server. Please check the messages
&gt; window for more info.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -this most probably fails because the net backend, does not support the
&gt; options -r -p, but i have no way of disabling these on the jzck control
&gt; interface... so one thing to watch out for.
&gt;
&gt; -r48000 -p1024 do not make sens in ht net case: those parameters are
&gt; actually get from the master.
&gt;
&gt; This is a bug in Qjackctl
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -so on the slave jack, i started it from the command prompt as
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; jackd.exe -S -R -dnet
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -and got the following
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; ****************************************************
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -NICE!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OPERATION
&gt; &gt; ------------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; with this setup i routed sound from the slave to the master.
&gt; &gt; indeed i fired up FL studio on windows and used the "jack router"  asio
&gt; driver.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; nice and easy, the FL showed up as a pair of new ports on the slave
&gt; jack's connection pane. once i also connected a pair of the inputs into FL
&gt; studio, a pair of input ports appeared on the slave jack! NICE! :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; if i start 8 playback and 4 capture channels on the slave jack I
&gt; generally get very decent sound.
&gt; &gt;  I do get a few of these though
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i get these even with just 2 capture and 2 playback ports only. still
&gt; they are infrequent.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Coming to think of it, the clicks are probably due to some infrequence
&gt; xruns on the slave jack (can i do smth about it (i just realised as i
&gt; happened to hear a click in the sound while seeing the xrun counter being
&gt; incremented)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, then i enabled all 22 channels on netjack2 i tried to route a
&gt; simple audio stream from the slave to the master,  one way..
&gt; &gt; But the sound was far from great. I got alot of xruns and alot of
&gt; packets where dropped.
&gt; &gt; The reason is obvious, but it was a nice stress test. here are some
&gt; findings:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -slave command prompt says:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
&gt; &gt; .............(alot of these)...................
&gt; &gt; NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
&gt; &gt; NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
&gt; &gt; NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive

&gt; &gt; Unknown source port in attempted (dis)connection src_name [FL:out4]

&gt; &gt; NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
&gt; &gt; NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
&gt; &gt; NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -the Jack control (which i opened afterwards and identified the already
&gt; runnning connection) showed:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 02:08:43.374 XRUN callback (76).
&gt; &gt; 02:08:43.493 JACK connection change.
&gt; &gt; 02:08:45.306 XRUN callback (37 skipped).
&gt; &gt; 02:08:47.339 XRUN callback (3 skipped).
&gt; &gt; 02:09:00.197 XRUN callback (118).
&gt; &gt; 02:09:01.277 XRUN callback (119).
&gt; &gt; 02:09:01.533 XRUN callback (1 skipped).
&gt; &gt; 02:09:03.569 XRUN callback (1 skipped).
&gt; &gt; 02:10:11.069 JACK connection change.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -the jack master was alot more talkative:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; 02:32:07.086 XRUN callback (1).
&gt; &gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = stardom was not run: state = 2
&gt; &gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = stardom was not run: state = 1
&gt; &gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; &gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = stardom was not run: state = 1
&gt; &gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; &gt; Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
&gt; &gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = stardom was not run: state = 1
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; TRANSPORT:
&gt; &gt; --------------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i started hydrogen on the jack master and routed the sound to the jack
&gt; slave and directly back  to the jack master and from the there to the sound
&gt; card. pressing the play button on hydrogen would not start playing
&gt; immediately, but only after a few seconds (about 10-15sec). when it finally
&gt; starts playing,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If i disconnect the slave jack, the start of playback is immediate. the
&gt; jack masters transport play button is also pressed and i get the message:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 02:42:16.937 Transport start.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; shouldn't the jack slave also be started??? or am i wrong to think that?
&gt;
&gt; Not implemented for now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thats all folks for now!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nass
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; - so I understand the result is somewhat mixed. I you can try latest
&gt; 1.9.9.4 that may helps in parts of the issue (like those "Cannot read named
&gt; pipe name = \\.\pipe\server_jack_default_0 err = 109" error...)
&gt;
&gt; - you can also try to increase the latency parameter on slave side, like:
&gt;
&gt; jackd -S -R -d net -l 10
&gt;
&gt; - you can also try to put master side in "Synchronous" mode (with the -S)
