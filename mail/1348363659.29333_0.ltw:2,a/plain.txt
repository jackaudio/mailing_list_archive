Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] a few tests on the netjack2 v1.9.8 connecting audio routes

so hello again,
so more news on transporting sound back and forth between linux and windows

i did install jack2 - 1.9.9.4 on both ends (32bits on both ends)

things work smoothly.
i carry 8C + 8P channels back and forth without any problem.

i do get some clicks and stuff when i see these messages in the server:

Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
Connection is not synched, skip cycle...
Connection is not synched, skip cycle...

and in client: (i get these both with and w/o "-dnet -l10"  - thats for
latency and i tried it as Staphane requested)

ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1302707770
Packet(s) missing from... -1 1
NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 149686076
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1308103740
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1758646842
Packet(s) missing from... -1 1
NetSlave : overloaded, skipping receive
ActivePortsFromNetwork: incorrect port = 1603161786

i also get a few XRUNS on the jack server (in linux) but these vanish if i
switch from -p128 to -p256.

i also tried -S option for Sync in : client only, both client and server.

hydrogen takes too long to start playing (it stops immidiately though).
once hydrogen is rolling, jack server also says rolling - there is no way
to start the jack server rolling from qjackctl play button.
on the jack client side, i can roll freely from qjackctl, but it does not
start/stop anything in either the client side (i have FL studio running),
nor on the server side.

that's pretty much my findings. For audio processing this is great (16
channels of audio is rather massive for home DAW)

On a side note:
im also trying to get sound from amSynth and try to control it through midi
virtual keyboard. bammer.
i compiled and installed 2 virtual keyboards. jack - keyboard and vkeybd.
the former shows up in midi connections tab, and i can connect it to
amSynth. But i can hear no sound - it is as if  the signals never reach am
synth.
The latter, i can't even see it in midi connections pane...

I'm sure i've seen screenshots in the internet of vkeybd showing up in
jack..
anything i am missing about how to start (perhpas) keybd in order for it to
show up?
other soft synths that you suggest i try (so as to verify virtual midi
connectivity can produce sound).

Last but not least.
I would like to run more than one qjackctl (and jackd) on the jack master
pc (linux). it seems impossible unless i open separate terminals and export
the variable $JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER as a difference value in each.

Then i can start a different qjackctl from each terminal. but i will not
get any ports (apart from system) showing up. basically, i'd expect the
windows jack client to show up in at least one of them (they both run
"jack_load netmanager" as a post jackd startup command).

Also i have set virtual alsa devices  (cloop and ploop - through an init
script called loop2jack, see here
http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge) so
as to route all sound from my desktop appz through one of the these running
jack instances on my linux jack master.

if i'm running a single qjackctl all the above will show up nicely, but not
if i run 2 sessions. is it possible to have clients show up in either of
the sessions? if it possible to  share audio, between different instances?

The reason i ask is because i have 2 audio cards on my DAW. one is prof
audio card and the other, the onboard soundcard. I would still like to add
some effect in the onboard soundcard, which i'll use to pass desktop sound
through.

I can not use the pro audio card for jackified desktop appz sound, because
 XRUNS are generated if i use the ploop and cloop alsa devices with low
jack server frame settings (-p128 and -p256). so redirecting the desktop
sound to another soundcard (through another jack) would be awesome. is it
possible?

Thank you for your help!
Nass
