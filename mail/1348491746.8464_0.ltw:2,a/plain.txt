using gdb for realtime code is generally not a very good way to analyse
them. the moment you hit a breakpoint, you will likely stop the entire jack
"system" from working until you quit and restart jack again. its much
better to use printf/cerr statements to print out information that is of
interest to you (and generally redirect that output to a file).
