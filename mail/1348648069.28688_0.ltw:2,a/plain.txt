I made a French translation / adaptation of it:

http://linuxmao.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=TUTO+%3A+ALSA+vers+JACK

with the addition of an optional soft volune control for the Loopback:

# soft volume
pcm.asoftvol {
  type softvol
  slave.pcm "amix"
  
  control { name PCM }
  
  min_dB -51.0
  max_dB   0.0
}

pcm.aduplex {
  type asym
  playback.pcm "asoftvol"
#  playback.pcm "amix"
  capture.pcm "asnoop"
}

Ciao,
Dominique
