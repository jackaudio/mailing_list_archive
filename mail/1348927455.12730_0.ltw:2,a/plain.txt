Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Netjack client on windows

Hi,

I have been successfully netjacking between macs running 10.68 / jackosx 0.89. Now I would like to netjack from a windows 7 machine.

I launch the Jack NetDriver item in the start menu and it appears to run OK but doesn't see the server (on a mac) - i get no outputs in qjackctl's connections window. Are there any other commands I need to use? Another mac on the network can connect to the server.

thanks,

oli
