Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Netjack client on windows

Hi,

thanks. I installed those versions but I still can't get the windows client to see the OSX master. 

I am doing the following:

1) launch jackpilot on mac 10.68 machine
2) type jack_load netmanager in command prompt on mac
3) launch Jack NetDriver from start menu on win7 x64 machine
4) launch Jack Control on win7 machine

on windows it still says waiting for master. I've tried disabling the windows firewall - no joy.

This is on a wired university LAN. Should I test some ports or put in explicit IP address for the master?

cheers,

oli
