Subject:     [Jack-Devel] redirecting all sound to jack in win7

Hello everyone,
there is this amazing alsa wiki that enables the unix user
to redirect all sound to jack server , using the loopback virtual sound
card.
sweet!

I am looking for a similar functionality in windows (simply so I can
redirect all sound from one pc to another).
Is it possible?
I guess i'd need a similar virtual soundcard in windows, but i have no idea
if there is any and how it is called.

Thank you!
