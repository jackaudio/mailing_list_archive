JACK cannot help you with this, since the only Windows audio API it
supports is ASIO. This is widely used by pro-audio and music creation
applications, but not by most consumer audio applications. Any app using
ASIO can be redirected via JACK, but those using any of the half-dozen or
so other ways of doing audio i/o on Windows cannot.
