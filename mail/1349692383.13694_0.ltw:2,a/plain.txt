Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] redirecting all sound to jack in win7

this is unfortunate..
i was hoping one (maybe even me, though I know nothing about drivers
programming)
could program a couple (playback and capture) of fake audio devices that
would take sound
and present it as cloop and ploop devices in jack - exactly like what is
done alsa...

is there a theoretical obstacle or just a lack of drivers?
