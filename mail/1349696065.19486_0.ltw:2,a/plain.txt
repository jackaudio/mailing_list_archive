i believe that its a lack of drivers/developers interested+capable of doing
the work. in addition, there are MANY different audio APIs on windows, and
depending on the solution adopted, there may be multiple solutions
required. although the latest versions of Window does "unify" these APIs to
some extent, its not a given that a solution that presents a "device" will
work for every different windows audio API.
