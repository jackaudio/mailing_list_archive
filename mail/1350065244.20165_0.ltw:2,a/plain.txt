Subject:     [Jack-Devel] please add more informative 'device busy' error message to JACK2

Hi JACK 2 devs!

I'd say that pretty much the only real problem I frequently encounter with
JACK2 (1.9.9) is sometimes I cannot start it because another process is
occupying the device so when this happens I often find it easier just to
reboot rather than figure out and kill the process using the device I want
to start JACK with.

This problem has been fixed in JACK1 for a while so I'm hoping JACK2 could
be updated to do the same?

Thanks!

Dan
