We are happy to announce the next issue of the Linux Audio Conference

Acoustics, in Graz, Austria.

The Linux Audio Conference is an international conference that brings
together musicians, sound artists, software developers and researchers,
working with Linux as an open, stable, professional platform for audio
and media research and music production. LAC includes paper sessions,
workshops, and a diverse program of electronic music.

We invite submissions of papers addressing all areas of audio processing
and media creation based on Linux. Papers can focus on technical,
artistic and scientific issues and should target developers or users. In
our call for music, we are looking for works that have been produced or
composed entirely/mostly using Linux.

The online submission of papers, workshops, music and installations is
now open at

This year's conference is hosted by IEM, Graz, in cooperation with local
artists and FLOSS enthusiasts.
The Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics (IEM) at the University
