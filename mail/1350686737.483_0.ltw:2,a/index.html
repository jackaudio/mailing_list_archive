&gt;&gt; Hi all,thanks for all the good&#xA0; work on jack,I use it for almost a year
&gt;&gt; now to
&gt; record audio with ardour at home,and recently take is to rehearshal and on
&gt; stage.It works almost always perfectly, after getting used to it and some
&gt; finetuning.But for the live performanc,monitoring is quite important for
&gt; the
&gt; singer, gitarist etc,so I was considering in-ear-monitoring,because it
&gt; seems to
&gt; work really good,but the devices are about 170 euro each,
&gt;&gt; and then I was playing and reading about netjack,and thinking, heh if it
&gt;&gt; could
&gt; work on android devices over the wifi,woud be the perfect
&gt; solution.Monitoring is
&gt; not as critical with regards to dropoutsas wireless instruments or voice.I
&gt; did
&gt; read a recent post on your mailing list about android,what would be the
&gt; use of
&gt; porting it,well, for me that would be this,Thanks and greetings Arthur

&gt; Hi man, I've been researching about android audio routing and before get
&gt; here I
&gt; just saw this page that maybe can help us...
&gt;
&gt; http://nettoyeur.noisepages.com/2010/09/hello-world/
&gt;
&gt; I'm just reading about it but I think this is what you are looking for...
&gt;
&gt; hopes this be useful.
&gt;

Unfortunately, the developers in charge of the Android sound system chose
to implement a new soundlayer (audioflinger) that is not low latency
capable or flexible enough to accomodate JACK in it's current state which
means that any port of JACK to Android will be crippled and of little
value/use for professional requirements.

Most Linux Audio Developers agree that the only way around this after
three years of almost zero progress for professional audio requirements
from Google is to ignore Android and work with hardware that can run the
normal Linux Audio Stack.

Given the progress from Intel and ARM with new hardware capable of running
x86 and the advances in the Linux Desktop it should not be long before we
will see native Linux systems on the latest mobile devices and we can
forget about the lack of interest from Google in professional audio
requirements on Android.

The simple truth appears to be that Google just doesn't get pro audio.
