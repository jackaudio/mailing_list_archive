Unfortunately, the developers in charge of the Android sound system chose
to implement a new soundlayer (audioflinger) that is not low latency
capable or flexible enough to accomodate JACK in it's current state which
means that any port of JACK to Android will be crippled and of little
value/use for professional requirements.

Most Linux Audio Developers agree that the only way around this after
three years of almost zero progress for professional audio requirements
from Google is to ignore Android and work with hardware that can run the
normal Linux Audio Stack.

Given the progress from Intel and ARM with new hardware capable of running
x86 and the advances in the Linux Desktop it should not be long before we
will see native Linux systems on the latest mobile devices and we can
forget about the lack of interest from Google in professional audio
requirements on Android.

The simple truth appears to be that Google just doesn't get pro audio.
