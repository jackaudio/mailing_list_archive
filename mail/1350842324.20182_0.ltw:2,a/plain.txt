Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Audioadapter broken pipe error in Jack 1.9.8

I'm following the guides to get a working linux-to-linux netjack setup
running. I think I'm close, but I'm getting stuck with a "Broken pipe"
(and broken audio) when I try to load the audioadapter.

I'm running Jack2 version 1.9.8 which I start in realtime with the net
backend, like so:

[root@alarmpi jack2]# jackd -R -d net

I load the audioadapter with this command in another terminal:

[root@alarmpi ~]# jack_load audioadapter -i "-d hw:CODEC"
audioadapter is running.
client name = audioadapter


When I do, the server gives this output followed by a long string of
"Broken pipe" messages accompanied by clicking noises on the USB audio
device:

Those broken pipe errors continue until I unload the audioadapter. I
should note that the network audio piece of this "worked", meaning I
could send sound from the host to this client by connecting all the
ports. It sounded terrible, of course, because these errors just kept
coming, but I feel like I'm very close to having a low-latency stream
to a $35 piece of hardware (a Raspberry Pi).

I am able to play audio from a "normal" audio player via Alsa through
the USB device without issue.

Any thoughts on what I could do to fix this or work around it?

I tried getting the latest version from git and managed to compile it
on this device, but jack wouldn't start. It kept giving a "Bus error"
accompanied by memory alignment errors in the kernel log. I assumed
that was something specific to the arm hardware and didn't want to
bother everyone with it. I can give more details on that if you want,
but my hope would be to find a solution within the 1.9.8 codebase I
have running "successfully" on this machine.

Thanks - let me know if you need more details.
