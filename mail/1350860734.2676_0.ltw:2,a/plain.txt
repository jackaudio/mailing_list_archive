it looks like you've made an error in your use of Master/Slave Mark.

On Machine 1 (master) start jack normally = jackd -dalsa ( -R no longer 
needed - jack defaults to realtime now)

then start   jack_load netmanager on your master machine. (you can add 
this to the startup script uder setup>options in qjackctl if you use it)

On Machine 2 (slave) start jack with = jackd -dnet  and watch the magic 
happen :)
