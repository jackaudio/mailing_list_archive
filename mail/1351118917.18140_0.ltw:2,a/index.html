&gt; &gt; I hope someone can give me some guidance with Jack.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have Jack set up. All seems to work fine. I can record and playback fine etc.
&gt; &gt; My issues starts when I leave Jack running and not doing anything.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It eats CPU % continually. Making my system quite overloaded until I restart Jack. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it just jackd or are there any jack-clients active when this happens?
&gt; e.g. some reverb effects that just process silence..

That's similar to my thought: perhaps there's some effect (most likely a
reverb) that's not coping with the denormals which are prevalent when jack
is sitting doing nothing.  I have seen similar spikes in CPU consumption
within ardour when the transport is stopped and denormal protection was
inadvertently left off.

If there are no jack clients running - that is, if only jack is running -
then the symptoms seem strange.
