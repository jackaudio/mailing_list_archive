That's similar to my thought: perhaps there's some effect (most likely a
reverb) that's not coping with the denormals which are prevalent when jack
is sitting doing nothing.  I have seen similar spikes in CPU consumption
within ardour when the transport is stopped and denormal protection was
inadvertently left off.

If there are no jack clients running - that is, if only jack is running -
then the symptoms seem strange.
