That's similar to my thought: perhaps there's some effect (most likely a
reverb) that's not coping with the denormals which are prevalent when jack
is sitting doing nothing.  I have seen similar spikes in CPU consumption
within ardour when the transport is stopped and denormal protection was
inadvertently left off.

If there are no jack clients running - that is, if only jack is running -
then the symptoms seem strange.


Thanks all for the help and tips.

There is always one jack client running for me and that is my ALSA loop, sadly.
I also noticed I had launched jack with "-Xraw" as acoswt pointed out. I don't use MIDI 
as such I've turned it off.

So now I am going to re run my checks over the next few days to see if it happens again.
With just -Xraw removed it seems not be happening, regardless of having ALSA loop running or not.

Thank you
