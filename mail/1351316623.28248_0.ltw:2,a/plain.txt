Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] ARM issue resolution?

There is a git branch that do this structure fields aligned somewhere, but I would like to release 1.9.9 before.

Theres is also this old "pipelining" version (see: http://www.mail-archive.com/[hidden]/msg00416.html that would make sense on a massive multi-core machine. That would be interesting to rework this also...

It's working now on that distro, at least by the somewhat inaccurate measurement that sound comes out of the USB speakers I have attached to the Pi. I just installed the package that the Arch maintainers prepared and it worked out the box.
