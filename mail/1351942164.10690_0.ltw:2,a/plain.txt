Hi,

Did you have any luck fixing this? Was the problem only that qjackctl 
crash at exit?

I'm about to distribute a version of Radium for windows, which is going 
to use Jack.
But the problem is that qjackctl 0.3.4.10 in windows crashes when you 
try to choose
input or output device for portaudio. I think this is a big problem. I 
don't want
to instruct people to start a console, write jackd -dpulseaudio -l to 
find devices,
then write jackd -R -S -dpulseaudio -d "<device name>", and so forth. 
I'm afraid to scare
people away then.

I have tried to cross-compiling 0.3.9 in mingw on linux, but there's 
just too many problems.

Perhaps you could send me your binary of 0.3.8 if you still have it?
