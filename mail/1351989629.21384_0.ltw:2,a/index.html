Hi,

I'm trying to get a Jack DBUS setup working on Fedora 18, attached is
my current jack/conf.xml, I'm using jack_control to send the control
messages and QJackCtl to monitor the jack output.

At the moment I'm having two issues. One is a failure to get
pulseaudio to release the audio device:
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: Starting jack server...
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 60
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: control device hw:1
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: control device hw:1
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Failed to acquire device
name : Audio1 error : Method "RequestRelease" with signature "i" on
interface "org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1" doesn't exist
[0m
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Audio device hw:1 cannot be
acquired...[0m
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Cannot initialize driver[0m
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: JackServer::Open() failed with -1[0m
Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Failed to open server[0m

If pulse is running but doesn't have the device then jack starts okay
and the sink/source modules get loaded.

The other problem is that I have separate capture and playback
devices, but when jackdbus starts successfully (when pulse isn't
holding the devices), both connections are to whatever interface is
set as 'device'. Setting 'device' to 'none' just gets me
DBus exception: org.jackaudio.Error.Generic: Failed to open server

It seems having "device" unset might allow that, but once it is set it
can't be cleared (short of manually removing it from the conf.xml).
Not being able to unset the device might be a limitation of
jack_control (don't know enough about the dbus python api to fix
that), but possibly having the capture and playback devices explicitly
set means they should override the device setting?

Any advice on either of these?
