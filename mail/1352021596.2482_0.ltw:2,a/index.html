&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to get a Jack DBUS setup working on Fedora 18, attached is
&gt; my current jack/conf.xml, I'm using jack_control to send the control
&gt; messages and QJackCtl to monitor the jack output.
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment I'm having two issues. One is a failure to get
&gt; pulseaudio to release the audio device:
&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: Starting jack server...
&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 60

&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: control device hw:1
&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Failed to acquire device
&gt; name : Audio1 error : Method "RequestRelease" with signature "i" on
&gt; interface "org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1" doesn't exist
&gt; [0m
&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Audio device hw:1 cannot be
&gt; acquired...[0m
&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Cannot initialize driver[0m
&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: JackServer::Open() failed with -1[0m
&gt; Sat Nov  3 20:08:11 2012: [1m[31mERROR: Failed to open server[0m
&gt; 
&gt; If pulse is running but doesn't have the device then jack starts okay
&gt; and the sink/source modules get loaded.

Someone recently reported on IRC the same issue. The conclusion I got
was that pulseaudio is not conforming to the device reservation API. I
suggest you to contact someone from the pulseaudio project. Please CC me
because I'm interested on this issue.   

&gt; The other problem is that I have separate capture and playback
&gt; devices, but when jackdbus starts successfully (when pulse isn't
&gt; holding the devices), both connections are to whatever interface is
&gt; set as 'device'. Setting 'device' to 'none' just gets me
&gt; DBus exception: org.jackaudio.Error.Generic: Failed to open server
&gt; 
&gt; It seems having "device" unset might allow that, but once it is set it
&gt; can't be cleared (short of manually removing it from the conf.xml).
&gt; Not being able to unset the device might be a limitation of
&gt; jack_control (don't know enough about the dbus python api to fix
&gt; that), but possibly having the capture and playback devices explicitly
&gt; set means they should override the device setting?

I believe these issues are already fixed in latest git version of jack2.
ALSA driver parameters are properly prioritized and jack_control got
commands for resetting parameters to their default state.
