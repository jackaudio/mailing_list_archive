Someone recently reported on IRC the same issue. The conclusion I got
was that pulseaudio is not conforming to the device reservation API. I
suggest you to contact someone from the pulseaudio project. Please CC me
because I'm interested on this issue.

I believe these issues are already fixed in latest git version of jack2.
ALSA driver parameters are properly prioritized and jack_control got
commands for resetting parameters to their default state.
