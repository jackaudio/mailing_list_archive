Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack Pilot Crashes (portaudio)

Hello Team,
Jack Pilot looks like an amazing concept and on it's own for what it does
in the PC world.

I am using windows 7 (laptop Asus G74S), Ableton, Traktor and NI's Audio
8DJ,

When connecting I can't get Audio 8DJ to show up in the connections window
via portaudio.

When I click on the input devices to populate what ASIO devices I have Jack
Pilot crashes.
If I click on the drop down input devices I get the default choices.

I can connect Traktor to Ableton no problem but without being able to use
the portaudio and connect Audio 8DJ (sound card),
I will not be able to get audio to the outside world.

Please help I have spent a good part of the day trying out as many things
as I can think of.

Cheers,
Gaz
