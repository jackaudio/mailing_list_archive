Subject:     [Jack-Devel] recent change to jack1 firewire backend needs testing

I have just pushed a changed to the Jack1 firewire backend that provides it
with a latency callback so that things work correctly after a buffer size
change. This change had to be made in the ALSA backend as well. I tested
the ALSA backend, but do not have the equipment to test the FFADO one. I
would really appreciate it if someone could test it out (from git) and
verify that I got things right.

The expected behaviour is:

   * at startup, port latencies are set correctly
   * run jack_bufsize to change the buffer size in use
   * port latencies (for all ports, not just the backend) are set correctly
after the change

many thanks,
