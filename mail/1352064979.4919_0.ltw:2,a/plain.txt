Subject:     [Jack-Devel] building git / jack2 1.9.9 on Fedora

Hi again,

I'm trying to build jack2 git on Fedora using the Fedora spec file and
have hit a couple of issues. From what I've read current git is pretty
close to 1.9.9, so thought I'd give this a try. It's possible there's
extra setup that goes into making a tarball that I've missed and might
be causing problems, but http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jack-%{version}.tgz
is listed as the source location in the spec file and is no longer
available (and I don't think there's an equivalent .9 for the dropbox
linked from the download page).

Firstly doxygen doesn't build, this is an error in waf that traces back to:
  File "/home/ian/rpmbuild/BUILD/jack-1.9.9/jack-1.9.9/wscript", line
338, in build
    share_dir = bld.env.get_destdir() + bld.env['PREFIX'] +
'/share/jack-audio-connection-kit'
TypeError: 'list' object is not callable

waf has changed from 1.5 to 1.6.11 between jack 1.9.8 and current git,
so maybe this method is no longer available? I've also tried directly
running waf configure and build with doxygen enabled and got the same
result.

I can live without doxygen for the moment, so disabled building it and
tried again. Now the build mostly works until it hits a linker error.

I see the following difference in the wscripts I've got for 1.9.8 and
git/1.9.9, it may be it's been added during tarball creation:
@@ -222,8 +237,6 @@
         if m != None:
             svnrev = m.group(1)

     if Options.options.mixed == True:
         env_variant2 = conf.env.copy()
         conf.set_env_name('lib32', env_variant2)

That doesn't work either in 1.9.9, possibly due to the change in waf
version, as it passes '-lm -stdc++' as a single argument. Adding the
two separately (just -lm fails with missing stdc++ symbols) seems to
get me the rest of the way there.
The change that introduced this is
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/f28523ff5415c96d681551d2b3a614ef851b9b4a
which looks like it's meant to use a different method of specifying
libraries, but a comment on that suggests it's incomplete wrt. alsa,
which I think is what I'm seeing.

There's one final failure, which is more a Fedora packaging problem,
but it seems something has changed in the installed packages:

+ chmod 755 '/home/ian/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/jack-audio-connection-kit-1.9.9-12.fc18.x86_64/usr/lib64/jack/*.so'

error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.DObdrk (%install)

All the libraries now seem to be in:
<prefix>/lib64/

Though the following are in <prefix>/usr:
bin  include  share

The odd location for lib64 makes me wonder if this is another
waf/wscript-related problem. Suggestions about any of these issues
welcome.

Thanks for your time,
