Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK connects only JACK apps or any apps?

Hi,

 

I need to confirm if JACK connects only JACK apps or any apps. I need to
play a sound in my app with background music, and that sound will be sent
only to Skype or any chat apps I choose, but the background music will not
be sent to Skype or the chat apps I choose. On Windows, there is a
commercial SDK ¡§Virtual Audio Streaming¡š able to do this through
establishing a virtual microphone. On Mac, there is a free app called
Soundflower seems able to do this. But I have not found any equivalent
software on linux. JACK is almost the only close lib I could found. So I
need to make sure if it can fit my need.

 

If you have any better idea or suggestion, please kindly let me know.

 

Thank you,

 

Cid
