There are a few ways to achieve this. Probably a combination of pulseaudio
and jack will work for you.

You can get pulse to run as a jack client if you install jack2 with dbus
support. That way Pulse will automatically reconfigure and connect to jack
when Jack is started.

Otherwise there are several manual methods that you can use for connecting
pulse with jack1.

- The arch linux docs are pretty comprehensive.
