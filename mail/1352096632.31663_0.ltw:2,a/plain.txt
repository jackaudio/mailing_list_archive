Thank you Patrick.

Could pulseaudio and jack establish a virtual microphone?

We found a software "Virtual Audio Streaming" on Windows and Soundflower on Mac can establish a virtual microphone so our app can send sound to that virtual microphone, and that virtual microphone send the sound to skype or chat rooms which choose that virtual microphone as input device. At the same time, if we are playing music, the music will not be sent to the virtual microphone.

Or pulseaudio and jack combination is more powerful?

Thank you,

Cid

There are a few ways to achieve this. Probably a combination of pulseaudio
and jack will work for you.

You can get pulse to run as a jack client if you install jack2 with dbus
support. That way Pulse will automatically reconfigure and connect to jack
when Jack is started.

Otherwise there are several manual methods that you can use for connecting
pulse with jack1.

- The arch linux docs are pretty comprehensive.
