I did a brief test. Always -p 512

With your recent jackd1 modifications:

system:capture_14
        total latency = 512 frames
system:playback_1
        total latency = 1024 frames


With jackd2:

firewire_pcm:0005950400400fb2_ADAT8_in
        total latency = 512 frames
firewire_pcm:0005950400400fb2_Bus1 L_out
        total latency = 1536 frames


Given that -n3 is the default for firewire, jackd2 might be correct
here, but I haven't checked your modifications, so I'm just guessing.
