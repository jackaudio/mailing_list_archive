Subject:     [Jack-Devel] How to run multiple jackdbus

Hi !
I'm trying to run multiple jackdbus…
I'm writing an app and I want to use jackd with another server name
than "default" to let the user to have is own jackd!
The idea is to launch a jackd and do some connections between elements
without polluting the user's jackd nor his patchbay, and perhaps
provide a virtual interface between the two jackd.

I can rename jackd easily with cli jackd and jackdbus, I know how to
run multiple legacy jackd, but I don't know how to run multiple
jackdbus.
I'm writing an app and I like how it's cool to configure and manage
jackd using jack dbus interfaces, but if I start and configure jackd
using dbus and renaming it to "other" (instead of "default"), I'm not
running another dbus, I'm renaming the default jackd ! This is not I
want. If the user try to run jackdbus, he will use my jackd!

Any Idea ?

Some examples :

without dbus I can do this:
$ jackd -n default -d dummy -C0 -P0
then
$ jackd -n other -d dummy -C0 -P0

then I can bind a patchage [http://drobilla.net/software/patchage/] this way :
$ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=default patchage
and another this way :
$ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=other patchage

If I do that :
$ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=other gst-launch-0.10 audiotestsrc !
"audio/x-raw-float,channels=2" ! jackaudiosink connect=0
client-name=test
I can see the "test" client in the patchage connected to "other"
jackd, not int the "default" jackd.

I can also do that :
$ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=default jack_lsp
test:out_jackaudiosink0_1
test:out_jackaudiosink0_2
$ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=other jack_lsp
--- nothing

If I do that :
$ gst-launch-0.10 jackaudiosrc server=default client-name=test !
"audio/x-raw-float,channels=2" ! jackaudiosink connect=0 sync=0
server=other client-name=test

It's pretty cool :
$ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=default jack_lsp
test:in_jackaudiosrc0_1
test:in_jackaudiosrc0_2
$ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=other jack_lsp
test:out_jackaudiosink0_1
test:out_jackaudiosink0_2

It is so easy to manage multiple jackd (and perhaps connect them) using cli!
How to do the same with jackdbus? How to run multiple jackdbus? It
would be very exciting!

Thanks in advance.
