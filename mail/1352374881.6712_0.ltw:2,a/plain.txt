JACK:
 pro:
   - sample accurate scheduling/delivery
   - single, "consistent" API for audio + MIDI
   - MIDI note data arrives in the correct thread for synthesis
 con:
   - no handling of large messages (sysex)
   - MIDI data arrives in the wrong thread for anything except synthesis
   - some overhead to reach MIDI h/w ports and non-JACK-MIDI apps
   - no advance scheduling

ALSA
 pro:
   - advance scheduling
   - less overhead to reach MIDI h/w ports
   - MIDI data arrives in a suitable thread for non-synthesis purposes
   - full support for sysex messages of any size
 con:
   -  MIDI data arrives in the wrong thread for synthesis purposes
   - another large API for dealing with MIDI, different from audio
   - less precision when scheduling
   - more overhead to deliver to other apps
