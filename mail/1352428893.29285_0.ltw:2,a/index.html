Hey there,
i am sorry to hijack this thread.
I read that it is possible to run more than one jack sessions (from the
same or different user)? And can each session be outputting to a different
soundcard????

If this is indeed the case, could you provide some info on how to go about
that?

Also what does jackd use the dbus for?
(meanwhile i'll go check out what the dbus does exactly)

Thanks!

&gt; You are entering terra incognita... :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm writing an app and I want to use jackd with another server name
&gt; &gt; than "default" to let the user to have is own jackd!
&gt; &gt; The idea is to launch a jackd and do some connections between elements
&gt; &gt; without polluting the user's jackd nor his patchbay, and perhaps
&gt; &gt; provide a virtual interface between the two jackd.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can rename jackd easily with cli jackd and jackdbus, I know how to
&gt; &gt; run multiple legacy jackd, but I don't know how to run multiple
&gt; &gt; jackdbus.
&gt; &gt; I'm writing an app and I like how it's cool to configure and manage
&gt; &gt; jackd using jack dbus interfaces, but if I start and configure jackd
&gt; &gt; using dbus and renaming it to "other" (instead of "default"), I'm not
&gt; &gt; running another dbus, I'm renaming the default jackd ! This is not I
&gt; &gt; want. If the user try to run jackdbus, he will use my jackd!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any Idea ?
&gt;
&gt; The current jackdbus D-Bus presentation was designed for single server
&gt; scenario. For multiserver scenario, the plan was to have one D-Bus
&gt; object per server controller and eventually an object+interface for
&gt; managing these objects (add new server, remove it, rename it). How
&gt; people are actually using multiserver scenario was never clear to
&gt; me. Multiple cards? Multiple users? Testing setups?
&gt;
&gt; There are several problematic areas:
&gt;  * one jackdbus instance per session bus
&gt;  * per-user jack server settings that are autosaved
&gt;  * session vs user
&gt;
&gt; "session vs user" is actually issue at dbus level. AFAIK it is not yet
&gt; solved. I clearly see different use of per-user bus daemon and
&gt; per-session bus daemon. Right now they are merged. If you treat it as
&gt; session bus, you want to access it from different sessions. If you treat
&gt; it as user bus then you may want multiple services per user (multiple
&gt; cards, test setups).
&gt;
&gt; "per-user jack server settings that are autosaved" is issue only if you
&gt; want to use multiple jack server intances per user. It is clear that each
&gt; server must have its own settings persisted in ~/.config/jack/. It is
&gt; not clear whether all jack servers must run within same jackdbus process,
&gt; or there must be one jackdbus process per server, or something in
&gt; between.
&gt;
&gt; "one jackdbus instance per session bus" is problem only if you treat
&gt; session bus as user bus. It should be possible to run multiple session
&gt; bus daemons for same user with each jackdbus daemon attaching to
&gt; different dbus session bus. I can imagine only one functionality that
&gt; could cause problem - the X11 server storage for session bus address. If
&gt; it indeed is a problem, I think you can build dbus without this
&gt; functionality (but your "desktop/login" setup could break, depends on
&gt; how it is made).
&gt;
&gt; A related issue is that server name in jackdbus engine settings is
&gt; useless and some users get into trap to set it. In context of
&gt; multiserver setups, the server name is actually key/id for settings of
&gt; that server. In context of single user setups, the server name only
&gt; causes confusion. So this engine setting should be removed from the
&gt; D-Bus presentation of the engine settings and maybe even from the
&gt; control API.
