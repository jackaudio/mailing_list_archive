Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] How to run multiple jackdbus

Hey there,
i am sorry to hijack this thread.
I read that it is possible to run more than one jack sessions (from the
same or different user)? And can each session be outputting to a different
soundcard????

If this is indeed the case, could you provide some info on how to go about
that?

Also what does jackd use the dbus for?
(meanwhile i'll go check out what the dbus does exactly)

Thanks!
