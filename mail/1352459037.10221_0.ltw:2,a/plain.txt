Same user, different user, it doesn't matter.

   $ jackd -n foo -d alsa -dhwXXX
   $ jackd -n bar -d alsa -dhwYYY
   $ jackd -n whatever -d firewire


Some jack clients provide a flag to specify which server to use, for
others, you can simply set JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER, e.g.:

   $ JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=bar some_jack_app

It doesn't, jackdbus does. If you check the archive, you will find a 200+
thread from two years ago about all the subtle differences. ;)

Well, afaik, jackd2 indeed uses dbus to talk to pulseaudio for device
acquisition, but Nedko can tell for sure.
