AFAIK jackd partially implements the device reservation protocol. For
full implementaiton, dbus loop is required. Not sure if dbus is hooked
to jackd from both jack1 and jack2 codebase. I don't use the device 
reservation protocol on my machine and AFAIK no other jack developer
does. And I don't use jackd but jackdbus...
