Thanks for your answers !

OK !

How people are actually using multiserver scenario was never clear to

To me the idea is to have a "patchbay" connecting multiple tools in
one application but without pollute the user's patchbay.
With jackd using dummy driver with a name different that "default", it works.

The first is the most problematic :D

Oooh, good idea ! Don't know if it's easy (it means that my app must
also know how to launch and manage sessionbus :/).

For those who want to use it, server name is cool ! But yes, the name
is useless with dbus: unable to run multiple servers, so no need to
know how to identify them.
