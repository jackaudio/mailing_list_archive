Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Where can I get an older version of Jack, Version 1.9.5

Hi, I am having trouble with netone for jack version 1.9.8. It does
not seem to work on windows. I have downloaded JackNone-0.5 from
http://netjack.sourceforge.net/. This seems to work for the netone
functionality, but my applications do not show up in the jack server.
It is my understanding that a combination of Jack version 1.9.5 and my
JackNone-0.5 do work together. Where can I get this older version of
jack? If someone has it and there is no archive, will they please
contact me so that I can get it.

Thanks
