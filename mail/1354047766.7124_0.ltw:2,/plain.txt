In-Reply-To: rev8 [Jack-Devel] jack session fix (jack1) (1354042677.31384_0.ltw:2,)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jack session fix (jack1)

Hi,

I see your point of view. SM for handling this case should create new temporary directory and after successful save it can just replace this previous session dir.

.. but , when some app have a lot of data in session dir then that is waste of space. I think user should decide and take risk for such case. At least qjackctl warns before use of existed directory, but after all if user decide to try save then it allow that.

Situation is more complicated in QuitAndSave mode, because then some clients may already be closed. That's way I think there should be just Quit event type. If SM want QuitAndSave then it can do this in two steps 'save' (check if not error) and quit.
