Subject:     [Jack-Devel] How to start JACK with systemd

Hello

I'm using jack2 under Archlinux.
After systemd transition I cannot find a proper way to create
jack.service in order to start jack as all other daemons in my system.

Currently I tried with:
[Unit]
Description=JACK
After=getty.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackd -R -d alsa -P hw:0,1 -r 96000 -p 64

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

but it failed with:
Failed to connect to session bus for device reservation Unable to
autolaunch a dbus-daemon without a $DISPLAY for X11

There is no problem to start jack manually after booting process by
login into system and run jack from console.

PS:
1) BTW, my system is dedicated to audio and it is headless.
2) I use automatic systemd service to auto-login after boot process.
