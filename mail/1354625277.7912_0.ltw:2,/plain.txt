Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] How to start JACK with systemd

Thank you!

I did it :)
Firstly, I've installed git version if jack2 (without dbus).
Then modified jack.service like that:
[Unit]
Description=JACK
After=sound.target

[Service]
User=stefan
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackd -R -P 20 -d alsa -P hw:0,1 -r 96000 -p 64 -n 2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Everything is fine now

Cheers
Stefan
