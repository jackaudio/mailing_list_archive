Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Qjackctl patchbay switching

  Hi all,

(I'm a newcomer on this list; I hope I won't violate social conventions
or trespass on your time unduly.  I'm a Debian developer, amateur
drummer, I've tinkered a bit with Ardour and Jack, and submitted one
small patch to Qjackctl a few months ago, nothing more.)

  I'm wondering if there's a way to tell a running Qjackctl instance to
switch patchbays non-interactively.  I found how to start Qjackctl on a
given patchbay, but not how to control an already-running one.  However,
since invoking qjackctl again rises the window of the existing instance,
I gather there's already a mechanism whereby the new instance
communicates some information to the running one.  Could that be
expanded to also transmit a patchbay name?  Or did I just fail to find
the appropriate option?

  Thanks in advance,

Roland.
