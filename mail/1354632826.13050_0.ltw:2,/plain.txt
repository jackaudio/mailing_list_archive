I think you may be talking about using jack_connect and
jack_disconnnect (which are packaged with Jack). they allow to specify
how things are connected on the fly. I often use them in startup
scripts, so that everything is automatically connected exactly how i
want my clients to be - but, obviously i can do this on the fly as
well.

as a side note, you may want to look at some of the other tools
included with jack - there are several that can be incredibly useful
at times. (they live in /usr/bin and are named jack_xxx).
