&gt; Hey Roland,

  Hey, small world&#xA0;:-)

&gt;&gt;   I'm wondering if there's a way to tell a running Qjackctl instance to
&gt;&gt; switch patchbays non-interactively.  I found how to start Qjackctl on a
&gt;&gt; given patchbay, but not how to control an already-running one.  However,
&gt;&gt; since invoking qjackctl again rises the window of the existing instance,
&gt;&gt; I gather there's already a mechanism whereby the new instance
&gt;&gt; communicates some information to the running one.  Could that be
&gt;&gt; expanded to also transmit a patchbay name?  Or did I just fail to find
&gt;&gt; the appropriate option?
&gt;
&gt; I think you may be talking about using jack_connect and
&gt; jack_disconnnect (which are packaged with Jack). they allow to specify
&gt; how things are connected on the fly. I often use them in startup
&gt; scripts, so that everything is automatically connected exactly how i
&gt; want my clients to be - but, obviously i can do this on the fly as
&gt; well.

  Yeah, I'm aware of those, but I was looking forward to using the
patchbay feature, since it's simpler and more robust.

&gt; as a side note, you may want to look at some of the other tools
&gt; included with jack - there are several that can be incredibly useful
&gt; at times. (they live in /usr/bin and are named jack_xxx).

  I've looked at a handful of them, and will probably continue, yes.

Roland.
