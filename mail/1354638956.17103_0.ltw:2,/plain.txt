In-Reply-To: Roland Mas [Jack-Devel] Qjackctl patchbay switching (1354629949.10998_0.ltw:2,)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Qjackctl patchbay switching

Hi,

Patchbay is internal qjackctl feature, and AFAIK you can't manage it from command line (or MIDI) excluding start with some parameter.

You can also save your connections using JackSessions (jack_session_notify) ... or you can try this:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/aj-snapshot/#screenshots

I never use it, but looks great.

Regards
Pawel
