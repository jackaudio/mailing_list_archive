Subject:     [Jack-Devel] A PC audio routing newbie begging your indulgence

I do realize that this is likely the wrong place to post, so I will ask for
your permission before asking my question. What I need is some basic
guidance in audio routing and Jack seems like it can do what I need, but I
require some assistance. I have not been able to find any useful sources of
info, and you chaps appear to know more than the average Joe. 

 

So, if you will allow, I'd love to bend the list's ear. I not, however, I
will respectfully honor the list's wishes and move along quietly. 

 

Thank you in advance for your kindness. 

 

Tyler
