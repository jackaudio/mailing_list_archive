mpd stands for Music Player Daemon ->
http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki,
and I use it to play music from my homeserver (media PC), through
optical SPDIF on my sound card to the my home Hi-End audio components.
Optical signal from my homeserver goes directly to the Audiolab's
M-DAC.
That is why I choose 96kHz, and I don't really understand what you
meant with "MP3 player".

Here is output from "ulimit -a":

Yes, I'm run it via systemd and new in using this system. I have to
find a way how to check whether my settings are applied in programs
spawned from systemd.
