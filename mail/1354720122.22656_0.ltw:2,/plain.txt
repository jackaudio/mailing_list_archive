Thanks:)

BTW, you were right - it was systemd related.
"Cannot lock down ..." message doesn't appear any more after applying
scheduling policies in jack.service unit:

 [Unit]
Description=JACK
After=sound.target

[Service]
User=stefan
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackd -R -P 95 -d alsa -P hw:0,1 -r 96000 -p 64 -n 2 -z s
CPUSchedulingPriority=95
CPUSchedulingPolicy=rr
MemoryLimit=512M
MemorySoftLimit=512M
LimitRTPRIO=infinity
LimitRTTIME=infinity
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

I will follow your advice about increasing a bit the latency :)
