My final jack.service could be of any help for someone:

[Unit]
Description=JACK
After=sound.target

[Service]
User=stefan
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackd -d alsa -P hw:0,1 -r 96000 -n 2 -z s
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

It seems that settings in /etc/security/limits.conf are not applied
for services spawned with systemd.

Cheers
