Hey Roland,

I don't know why i didn't mention that (obviously I wasn't really
thinking - since i do have it installed). ~ Good on Pawel for bringing
that up. aj-snapshot is a great little utility.

Speaking of which - you might want to post Wiimdi to the linuxaudio
(announce) list about Wiimidi - once you feel that it is in a 'stable'
release/state  - which, imho it is ;)

As a side note: I will email you later (in more detail) about the
latest version of Wiimidi and also how using my wiimote-based midi
foot-controller (at an actual jam went).  I will say right now though,
that it is working fantastically well. :)
