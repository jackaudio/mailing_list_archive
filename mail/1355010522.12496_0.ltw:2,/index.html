&gt; I don't remember hearing other people talk about this interface before.

&gt; Does the 3G version still use an Envy24 chip?

IDK.  `envy24control` says, "No ICE1712 cards found", but I'm not sure
if that sufficiently answers your question.

&gt; Are you absolutely sure that the synchronization is set up correctly so
&gt; that the cards are sharing word clock?

I *believe* I've set up word clock sync correctly using `echomixer`,
though I don't know how to verify that word clock is *actually*
working.  I assume that word clock is working because everything runs
smoothly most of the time - that is, I think, until I do something
that causes an initial xrun, like loading a song in Renoise, or
starting an application that uses JACK.  Not all *real* xruns cause
the spew of xruns, but there's some set of circumstances where it
happens.  I'm going to try to figure out exactly what that set of
circumstances is.

I just tried replacing the cable with a cable that I verified is
working with a cable tester, and I'm able to duplicate the problem.

&gt; What you described sounds like
&gt; what might happen if the clock sync starts slipping between two cards and
&gt; they are not filling their buffers at a locked rate any more.

If that happened, I would assume that the cards would each output the
same amount of frames at different times (please correct me if I'm
wrong).  I can't yet verify that this is or isn't happening.

I'm confused by why there are 32 frames available for reading *until*
256 more frames are made available by the card.

This thread seems relevant to the situation:

    http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/ALSA-multi-plugin-and-JACK-xrun-callbacks-td74462.html

I'm open to ideas on how to proceed.  For now, I'm going to add some
error messages to the multi plugin in ALSA, and see if I can figure
out what's going on.

Thanks,
