It turns out I'm wrong about this.

I added some errors messages to the multi plugin in alsa-lib, and have
found that:

1.) Both of the Layla 3Gs have the same amount of frames available
regardless of whether the xrun onslaught is happening.  So, when 32 is
reported back as the amount of frames available, both of the devices
have 32 frames available, despite the period size being 256.
2.) When one device has an *actual* xrun (e.g.
`snd_pcm_multi_avail_update` returns -EPIPE), the other one does too.
I haven't been able to generate a situation where only one device
generates an xrun.

This makes me think that the Layla 3Gs are synced, even though
`snd_pcm_avail_update` is returning a value such that
(snd_pcm_avail_update() % PERIOD_SIZE) != 0.  I'm confused about this.

Also, I've found that this situation can happen without an xrun.  For
example, the xrun onslaught sometimes happens immediately after I
start JACK.

If anyone has any ideas on what might be happening or where I should
dig next, please let me know.

Thanks,
