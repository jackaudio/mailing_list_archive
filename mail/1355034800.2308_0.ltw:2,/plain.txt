I was wrong about this too.  It appears that one of two scenarios happens:

1.) The master device has (period_size + 32) frames available, and the
other has 0 frames available.
2.) The master device has (period_size + 32) frames available, and the
other has 32 frames available.

So, it sure *looks* like an xrun, but it's not currently being handled
in `alsa_driver_wait` the same way that a detected xrun is handled.

I tried adding the following code just before the last return
statement in `alsa_driver_wait`:

	/* if the number of available frames is less than the expected frame
	   count, then handle this as a buffer underrun */

	if (avail < driver->frames_per_cycle) {
		*status = alsa_driver_xrun_recovery (driver, delayed_usecs);
		return 0;
	}

... and the situation improved considerably.  The onslaught of xruns
is now limited to a few at most.

@Paul, Torben, etc.: I'm not convinced that this is the best or
correct way to solve the problem, or if this will introduce problems
in other setups.  I think you'd know better than me.  If this is an
acceptable fix, I'll submit a patch.  Let me know.

Thanks,
