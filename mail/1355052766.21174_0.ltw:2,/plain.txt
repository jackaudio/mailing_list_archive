No problem!  I'm curious as to whether or not you're getting the same
32 mystery frames that I'm getting.

It occurs to me that EPIPE == 32.  I wonder if, somewhere in the ALSA
code, there is a function returning EPIPE to indicate an error, and a
caller that's blindly adding/subtracting the value to/from some
variable instead of checking for errors.
