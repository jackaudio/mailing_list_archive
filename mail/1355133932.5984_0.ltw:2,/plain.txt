I modified the CPU affinity of the IRQs of the two Layla 3Gs so that
they are only handled by one CPU, and modified the `irqbalance`
configuration so that it doesn't modify the CPU affinity settings for
the IRQs of the Layla 3Gs, and so that it doesn't use the CPU handling
the Layla 3G interrupts for other interrupts.

I haven't been able to trigger the onslaught of xruns in the past
hour, and I'm doing the same things that produced the xruns before
within 5 minutes or so.

@John (and anyone else experiencing tons of xruns with an ALSA PCM
multi setup): I suggest that you make the same modifications to your
system, and see if the problem goes away.  If you need any assistance,
let me know.

@Geoff: Thanks for the hint.  I appreciate it. :)
