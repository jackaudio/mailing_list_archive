Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Lock recursion in Trylock()

Hi all,
This is the first time I am writing to the list. I am not sure this is the right place to send patches, just let me know if you prefer the use of a different channel.
I am using jack in an embedded linux project, and I have had to analyze a crash dump from a (heavily threaded) client application, which failed on the
Jack_error line in JackPosixMutex.cpp: Trylock().

The cause of this is that jack_error() will call JackMessageBuffer::AddMessage() which will call Trylock(), which, if the lock is held, will call jack_error(), and the wole sequence will repeat until the stack is exhausted.

Below is a patch that simply disables the jack_error call for this case. Is it actually an error to call Trylock() from a different thread? This seems more like a copy-paste remnant from the Lock() function. The jack_error() calls in Lock() and Unlock() are probably not a problem, though they make me a bit uncomfortable as well.

I hope this helps,
Cheers,
Luciano
