&gt; within 5 minutes or so.
&gt; 
&gt; @John (and anyone else experiencing tons of xruns with an ALSA PCM
&gt; multi setup): I suggest that you make the same modifications to your
&gt; system, and see if the problem goes away.  If you need any assistance,
&gt; let me know.

I've tried smp_affinity here and it hasn't fixed the problem. It just
took longer for the xrun messages to show up.

I set the smp_affinity for the two ice1712 cards (which are on IRQ20
and 21) to CPU1 in my test system with the following:
echo "2" &gt; /proc/irq/20/smp_affinity
echo "2" &gt; /proc/irq/21/smp_affinity

Then I started jackd with my pcm_multi device at 96kHz and started
jamin to generate some load. At first it looked like this had worked,
but after about 5 minutes the xrun indications in jamin started piling
up. Both IRQs are definitely handled by CPU1 according to frequent
checks using cat /proc/interrupts.

My test system uses an AMD 4850e Athlon64x2 2.5GHz CPU. Running jamin at
96kHz uses 11% CPU according to jamin's load indicator.
