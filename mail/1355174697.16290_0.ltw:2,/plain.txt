Correction: It was running at 44.1kHz. For some reason the Audiophile
2496 cards only obey the jackd -r96000 option if used individually.
When used with pcm_multi and S/PDIF clock sync the master card always
starts at 44.1kHz unless explicitly set to the desired sample rate
in envy24control first. My main system with 3 x Delta 1010 always
obeys the jackd option. Sorry for the confusion.
