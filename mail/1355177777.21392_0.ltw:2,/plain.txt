Geoff, I seem to remember you were running the cards in a dedicated
system with no X, connected via netjack to a separate box running
the DAW software. Is that still the case?

I could never get the performance you described on a single computer
running everything. I'm almost 100% certain the UP system I mentioned
also suffers from these phantom xruns with pcm_multi (but haven't been
able to confirm that yet). It seems to be very dependent on system load,
kernel version and configuration.

John
