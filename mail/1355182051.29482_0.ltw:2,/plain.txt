Disclaimer: I work on FFADO and wrote the driver for MOTU firewire devices.

Don't purchase anything made by MOTU for this.  MOTU are hostile to Linux
and have provided no assistance for the development of drivers for their
interfaces.  The drivers we do have (provided via FFADO) are the result of
protocol analysis and have been written primarily to assist the migration of
existing MOTU owners to Linux.  I strongly discourage you from purchasing
MOTU firewire interfaces for any new project or setup which involves Linux.

Beyond the hostile vendors there are firewire interfaces which could work
for you under Linux (a small Focusrite/Presonus/Echo for example), but given
your initial description my gut feeling is that a PCI-based solution would
work best in your situation.  However, there are many others on the list who
have far more experience in this sort of thing than I, so I'll defer to
their judgement.

Regards
  jonathan
