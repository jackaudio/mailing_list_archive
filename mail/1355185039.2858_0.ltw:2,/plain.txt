If you already have an 828mk2 then I'd be inclined to give it a go.  The
828mk2 has been reported to work by numerous users over the years and it
would certainly work in your situation.  In the event that it doesn't work
out you've lost nothing but a little time.

It sounds like it was suffering from digital noise getting into the analog
circuits.  This could be radiated by nearby cards or cables, or even
mainboard settings (clock spread spectrum settings for example).  Since the
card is old, there may even be an issue with some filter capacitors which
are making it more susceptable to noise pickup.

Again, this sounds like radiated noise getting into the analog circuits.  If
the ADAT interfaces are used this won't be a problem.
