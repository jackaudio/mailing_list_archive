I did something similar two years back: Recorded the impulse-response
of my home-office, feed them to drc and then used the resulting files
with jconvolver to correct four channels of speakers. I planned to do
more but the amp for channels 3-8 is a diy-project and time ran out...

But for the multichannel-output I used a presonus firepod successfully.
Today I would recommend different vendors, but presonus isn't as bad as
motu:

Don't buy their stuff. 'nuf said.

As you have a pretty stationary setup, I would recommend something
PCI(-Express) based.
If you can score a delta1010, maybe that enough channels for you.
Otherwise the RME Raydat has lots of ADAT IOs. And it has a smaller
brother with single ADAT in case thats enough channel-wise.
Then there is also http://www.marian.de/products who do have pci/pcie
cards with one or many ADAT IOs. And I was told theres a linux driver
for it.
Then buy the needed number of adat converters or even feed it from a
digital console and you're set.

Have fun,

Arnold
