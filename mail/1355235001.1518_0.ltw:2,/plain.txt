Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] speaker management

Hi there,
I don't mean to interrupt the course that the conversation has taken,
but it might be the case that the OP should re-think the bruteFIR solution.
As the author at http://www.ludd.luth.se/~torger/brutefir.html#whatis
states

"Also, due to its relatively high I/O-delay, BruteFIR is most suited for
applications when the input signal is not live. "

Is the OP certain that this suitable for the club application ?
If yes, how come you choose to go forth with it?
