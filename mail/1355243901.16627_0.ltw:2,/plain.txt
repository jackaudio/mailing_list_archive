that is surely feasible. but a pc based solution will always have more 
downtime than a dedicated piece of hardware - there's so many more 
things that can go wrong in a pc. if that's ok for the job at hand, by 
all means go ahead, you will get a lot more capability and flexibility 
for less money.
careful design can alleviate this:
underclock the box (by pinning the cpu governor to a frequency less than 
the maximum).
put the system on a raid 1.
use SSDs rather than spinning disks: less heat, less power consumption, 
waaaay faster, but also expensive. ok if you don't need massive storage 
space, two 120GB ssds can be had for 200 € these days.
ensure good airflow, and make sure the rack it sits in isn't too hot.
use optical i/o to avoid static discharge damage and hum loops - hum 
isn't audible in digital copper circuits until the signal completely 
breaks down, but it's there and it lowers your safety margin.
strip down the linux system as much as possible.

yes, it does. but there are other convolvers as well. i don't know how 
low the latency of bruteFIR can be (does it do partitioned convolution 
at all?), and that will be important the moment you have djs who do live 
interaction. but fons' jconvolver is a good alternative, and it does not 
add any latency above the jack period length that you'll always have.

i would recommend against a firewire interface for fixed installations. 
firewire is very versatile if you want to use the hardware on different 
computers, but it does come at a price: much more complicated tuning, 
flimsy connectors, higher cpu load, possibly more problems with routine 
kernel updates...

the cheapest option is an ADAT capable card such as the RME HDSP series 
with a behringer ADA 8000 for eight channels analog in (for those who 
work with vinyl) and eight analog outs (enough for four-point surround 
plus two subs plus two monitor wedges or extra anteroom feeds). but 
there are cheaper adat cards out there...

as to your question, older RME pcie cards work well with all features 
supported, cutting edge ones like the MADI FX might not, but that 
usually gets fixed pretty quickly as soon as people actually use them 
and complain...

> How do I chain bruteFIR into Jack?

connecting software in jack is easy - get qjackctl and use the graphical 
patchbay while you're learning and experimenting. then, once you have 
decided what you setup will be, use the command line tool jack_connect 
in a script to automatically set your system up when you boot.

while you're at it, you might want to try fons' zita-lrx crossover 
between your tops and subs, it does linkwitz-riley and butterworth.
haven't used it in production yet, but a quick test suggests it does the 
job nicely.
