jackd  [ ... args ... ] -d alsa -d hw:FIRST &
alsa_in [ ... args ] -d hw:SECOND &
alsa_out [ ... args ] -d hw:SECOND &

[ .. repeat as needed]

much more general than your brief summary, since alsa_in/alsa_out will
resample as necessary, thus not requiring that the devices share a sample
clock.

there are also fons' version of alsa_in/out, which some people feel do an
even better job with the resampling and more.

now of course, if the devices are synced then none of this would be
necessary. if they are synced and ALSA gets things things wrong, the ALSA
needs fixing.
