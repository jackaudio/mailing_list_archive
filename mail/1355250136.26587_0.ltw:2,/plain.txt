interesting hypothesis! unfortunately, i seem to have hardware problems 
with my (quite ancient) RME DIGI 9652 in that i can't even get it to run 
on its own anymore, so i can't test it right now, but it sounds promising.

it would be very nice to have this feature supported and rock-solid, not 
the least because migrating mac users have come to expect such things to 
just work.
