It's my understanding that `alsa_in` and `alsa_out` add some latency,
which means that sound card that JACK is synced to and the sound card
that the alsa-in/out clients use aren't quite in sync.

What about cases where the word clock sync of a sound card isn't quite
as tight as it should be?  Does ALSA have control over that?
