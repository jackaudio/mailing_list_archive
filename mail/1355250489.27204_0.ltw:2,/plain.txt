ho-humm. for years, we all have been telling newbies in a more or less 
friendly way that cascading non-hardware-synced consumer gear to obtain 
cheap multichannel devices is evil. now that the word has spread and 
people try to do things the proper way, all of a sudden everybody 
advocates resampling. it's a great quick-and-dirty solution iff you can 
spare the cycles and don't care for bit-transparency, but in a 
professional context with synced hardware, it is an abomination. shame 
on you mr davis :)

don't get me wrong, i love alsa_in/out and zita-ajbridge for what they 
do, but they are a band aid for very specific use cases (notably, to get 
local i/o for _monitoring purposes_ on a netjack slave). putting them in 
the signal path for the final product isn't to be undertaken lightly.

so yes, alsa needs fixing.
