The second card is synced to the first via S/PDIF. My .asoundrc
doesn't contain a master parameter, but does have

ctl.capture16{
	type hw
	card 0
}

and a similar entry for the playback device. The ice1712 chip has 12
inputs and 10 outputs, so separate capture and playback devices have
to be configured. My full .asoundrc is shown here:
http://www.jrigg.co.uk/linuxaudio/ice1712multi.html

I just tried changing the ctl parameters to use card 1 and the messages
from pcm_multi are the same as before. BTW on my main system with
3 x ice1712 cards there's a common clock supplying all three cards
simultaneously. It also shows the same xrun messages from jackd when
using pcm_multi. It would be interesting to see what the extra fprintfs
in pcm_multi.c would show on that system.
