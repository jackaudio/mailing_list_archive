Hmmm.

Do you know offhand if `snd_pcm_link()` is supposed to synchronize the
poll file descriptors such that the poll file descriptors of the
master aren't set with events until both the master card and the card
it's linked to are ready with I/O?  If so, then the bug is probably
there somewhere.  If not, then I wonder how this synchronization is
supposed to happen.
