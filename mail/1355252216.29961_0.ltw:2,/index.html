I would think absolute worst case would be two different model cards, and
there is some ambiguity about when relative to the clock edge the sample
is available.  That should result in at most a +/- 1 sample difference
between the buffers of the two cards at any particular time, not multiple
periods difference.

Is the difference seen when the event occurs a 1 period difference, or
multiple periods?  Could it be as simple as the second card not flagging
the period of data as available until the last frame is latched, and there
being some fraction of a sample clock difference between when the first
card flags a period is ready and when the second card flags a period  is
ready?
I would have guessed that just the latency in servicing the interrupt
would have allowed the second card time to catch up, but maybe the current
processors are so fast that when the first card interrupts, the first card
and second card can be checked and the lack of data ready in the second
card flagged before the second card has had time to catch up.  That
difference between cards, if it exists, should be on the order of some
fraction of the 20 microsecond sample period.

Probably  not a useful line of investigation, unless it can be reconciled
with the later message from John Riggs:
&gt; BTW on my main system with 3 x ice1712 cards there's a
&gt; common clock supplying all three cards simultaneously.
&gt; It also shows the same xrun messages from jackd when
&gt; using pcm_multi.

My understanding of John's system is that he has three identical cards,
and has physically modified the hardware so that they all operate from a
single oscillator feeding the ice1712 chips on the cards.  I don't see how
it could apply to that system.  Possibly there is an ambiguity in that
case with startup because of differences in reset timing to the individual
cards, in which case the cards would be locked in frequency, but might
have a fixed offset in the number of frames in the buffers at any
particular time.

If that is the case, then the proper solution would be for ALSA to check
the status of each card that is part of the multi device, and not flag the
multi device as ready for the next read or write until all of the physical
devices are ready.  AND instead of OR.
