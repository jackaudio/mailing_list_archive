The results where very good and very worth the time! I started with
good quality speakers and a fine listening experience. Then I
introduced drc (and used some x-over with fons ambisonics decoder to
feed the bass only to the bigger front speakers) and was blown away by
the amazing sound. Of course it took some sinus-sweeps to get the
room-response but none of the neighbors complained;-)

If I find more time for audio again, I might even incorporate such a
thing into my live setup.

The only downside: when you start doing something with permanent drc
and have to run drc and your regular synth/recording sessions on the
same machine, you understand fons fighting for session managers that
can be told to get out of your way and ignore certain apps with their
settings (while still managing the same apps in different instances).

Have fun,

Arnold
