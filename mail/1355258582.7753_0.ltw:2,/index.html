&gt; &gt;&gt; What about cases where the word clock sync of a sound card isn't quite
&gt; &gt;&gt; as tight as it should be?  Does ALSA have control over that?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; my understanding is that word clock sync is all-or-nothing. you're either
&gt; &gt; precisely in sync or not at all.

Yes. Sync is achieved by using a phase-locked loop (PLL). It's either locked
completely or not at all. The PLL typically runs at 128 or 256 x fs, so
even if it takes a few tens of cycles to lock after startup, it synchronises
pretty quickly compared with the word clock period.
  
&gt; Do you know offhand if `snd_pcm_link()` is supposed to synchronize the
&gt; poll file descriptors such that the poll file descriptors of the
&gt; master aren't set with events until both the master card and the card
&gt; it's linked to are ready with I/O?  If so, then the bug is probably
&gt; there somewhere.  If not, then I wonder how this synchronization is
&gt; supposed to happen.

IIRC the link code didn't appear in early versions of pcm_multi and
was only added in alsa-lib-1.0.9rc1 (Jan 2005). It broke duplex operation
with pcm_multi. I commented it out for months to work around it on my own
systems. Eventually a change was made in JACK to make it work again. Some
info can be found here if interested:
