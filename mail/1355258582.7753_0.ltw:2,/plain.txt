Yes. Sync is achieved by using a phase-locked loop (PLL). It's either locked
completely or not at all. The PLL typically runs at 128 or 256 x fs, so
even if it takes a few tens of cycles to lock after startup, it synchronises
pretty quickly compared with the word clock period.

IIRC the link code didn't appear in early versions of pcm_multi and
was only added in alsa-lib-1.0.9rc1 (Jan 2005). It broke duplex operation
with pcm_multi. I commented it out for months to work around it on my own
systems. Eventually a change was made in JACK to make it work again. Some
info can be found here if interested:
