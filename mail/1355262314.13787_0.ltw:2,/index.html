&gt;&gt; &gt; I did something similar two years back: Recorded the
&gt;&gt; &gt; impulse-response of my home-office, feed them to drc and then used
&gt;&gt; &gt; the resulting files with jconvolver to correct four channels of
&gt;&gt; &gt; speakers. I planned to do more but the amp for channels 3-8 is a
&gt;&gt; &gt; diy-project and time ran out...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What were the results? I've thought about doing something similar and
&gt;&gt; wonder if it's worth my time.
&gt;
&gt; The results where very good and very worth the time! I started with
&gt; good quality speakers and a fine listening experience. Then I
&gt; introduced drc (and used some x-over with fons ambisonics decoder to
&gt; feed the bass only to the bigger front speakers) and was blown away by
&gt; the amazing sound. Of course it took some sinus-sweeps to get the
&gt; room-response but none of the neighbors complained;-)
&gt;
&gt; If I find more time for audio again, I might even incorporate such a
&gt; thing into my live setup.
&gt;
&gt; The only downside: when you start doing something with permanent drc
&gt; and have to run drc and your regular synth/recording sessions on the
&gt; same machine, you understand fons fighting for session managers that
&gt; can be told to get out of your way and ignore certain apps with their
&gt; settings (while still managing the same apps in different instances).
&gt;

This seems like it should be a simple flag in the session API. Can you
explain this issue a little more?

If the app doesn't have support for jack session management how can the
session manager be in the way?
