&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Sync is achieved by using a phase-locked loop (PLL). It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; either locked completely or not at all. The PLL typically runs at
&gt; &gt; &gt; 128 or 256 x fs, so even if it takes a few tens of cycles to lock
&gt; &gt; &gt; after startup, it synchronises pretty quickly compared with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; word clock period.
&gt; &gt; Correction: time taken to achieve lock can be significantly longer
&gt; &gt; than the word clock period (my PLL theory is a little rusty). On a
&gt; &gt; system where all cards are driven by a common clock this shouldn't be
&gt; &gt; an issue, but it still doesn't cure the problem being discussed.
&gt; 
&gt; Its even the other way around: The PLL has to adopt to changes rather
&gt; slowly. Otherwise the smallest jitter in the word-clock would make your
&gt; PLL run wild. But a slow PLL calls for a long time to sync.

Yes, I was obviously sleep-deprived when I made that comment about
PLLs locking quickly. In high quality audio interfaces it's common
to use two PLL stages, one to lock to the incoming clock and a
second one (often a VCXO) for jitter attenuation.
