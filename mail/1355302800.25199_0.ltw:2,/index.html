&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I did something similar two years back: Recorded the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; impulse-response of my home-office, feed them to drc and then
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; used the resulting files with jconvolver to correct four
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; channels of speakers. I planned to do more but the amp for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; channels 3-8 is a diy-project and time ran out...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What were the results? I've thought about doing something similar
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and wonder if it's worth my time.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The results where very good and very worth the time! I started with
&gt;&gt; &gt; good quality speakers and a fine listening experience. Then I
&gt;&gt; &gt; introduced drc (and used some x-over with fons ambisonics decoder to
&gt;&gt; &gt; feed the bass only to the bigger front speakers) and was blown away
&gt;&gt; &gt; by the amazing sound. Of course it took some sinus-sweeps to get the
&gt;&gt; &gt; room-response but none of the neighbors complained;-)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If I find more time for audio again, I might even incorporate such a
&gt;&gt; &gt; thing into my live setup.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The only downside: when you start doing something with permanent drc
&gt;&gt; &gt; and have to run drc and your regular synth/recording sessions on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; same machine, you understand fons fighting for session managers that
&gt;&gt; &gt; can be told to get out of your way and ignore certain apps with
&gt;&gt; &gt; their settings (while still managing the same apps in different
&gt;&gt; &gt; instances).
&gt;&gt; This seems like it should be a simple flag in the session API. Can you
&gt;&gt; explain this issue a little more?
&gt;
&gt; Lets see if I can manage to explain, maybe fons will chip in:
&gt;
&gt; The average jack session is with several apps all used for one project.
&gt; you save the project and want to save the settings for all the apps.
&gt; you restore (aka load) a project and want all the apps to come up again
&gt; with the correct settings. All current session managers aim to make
&gt; this as simple as possible (preferable by even supporting apps that
&gt; don't have native session-management support). And thats a fine goal.
&gt;
&gt; But when you do drc and/or ambisonics you end with a setup slightly
&gt; more complicated: there are some apps that are independant of the
&gt; project and stationary to the machine. Some of these apps might even be
&gt; the ones all the other apps should use as "hardware outputs" instead of
&gt; the real hardware outputs.
&gt; No problem when a) the session manager ignores these apps and b) the
&gt; project is not meant to be movable to a different machine.
&gt; By making session-management easier for 'most' people, todays
&gt; session-managers
&gt; break a) and forcefully support apps that don't want to be supported.
&gt; And as neither jack supports something like static port aliases nor
&gt; as session-managers correctly support the notion of distinct apps
&gt; as "the global environment", b) breaks. Because nowadays the session
&gt; connects to "alsa_pcm:playback_[12]" on one machine and has to connect
&gt; to "jconvolver:in_[12]" on another machine.
&gt;
&gt; So while session management nowadays is easy for 'most' people and
&gt; use-cases, its actually made impossible for these special cases.
&gt; Special cases like: I have this super-cool ardour-project using two
&gt; dozen synths and playing out to my native home-cinema surround-set. And
&gt; the audio is so cool that I want to play the same project on one of the
&gt; bigger ambisonics/wfs setups at the next LAC. Only my project connects
&gt; to 'alsa_pcm:playback_[1-6]' and when I do that on the wfs-machine I am
&gt; lucky when nothing of the hardware breaks because I sent my bass-beats
&gt; to the highest speaker of a four-way...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If the app doesn't have support for jack session management how can
&gt;&gt; the session manager be in the way?
&gt;
&gt; See above, when you write a session-manager for audio and want it to be
&gt; used, you support apps that don't support you...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There are probably some easy solutions to these problems outlined
&gt; above. But its "special cases" and it seemed to me the last years that
&gt; many developers don't want to deal with this and don't want to listen
&gt; to the people that have to deal with this.
&gt;


This all looks solveable to me. We have a few specific limitations. What
is the easiest way to enable the flexibility required?


&gt; But I am happy if I am proven wrong: if there is a session-management
&gt; for audio-projects that knows which app is part of the project and
&gt; which is part of the environment. If there is even a session-management
&gt; that knows about something like "the environment" apart from
&gt; alsa_pcm.
&gt;

We can assign static names to jack ports. IIUC, the main issue appears to
be that alsa i/o cannot be easily renamed/mapped in a session file.

So do we need a way to override the jack portnames in the JACK API?

Seems like a reasonable addition to the API to me.

Can you isolate the other issues that you feel would not be solved in this
case?
