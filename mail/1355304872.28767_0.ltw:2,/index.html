&gt;&gt; The average jack session is with several apps all used for one project.
&gt;&gt; you save the project and want to save the settings for all the apps.
&gt;&gt; you restore (aka load) a project and want all the apps to come up again
&gt;&gt; with the correct settings. All current session managers aim to make
&gt;&gt; this as simple as possible (preferable by even supporting apps that
&gt;&gt; don't have native session-management support). And thats a fine goal.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But when you do drc and/or ambisonics you end with a setup slightly
&gt;&gt; more complicated: there are some apps that are independant of the
&gt;&gt; project and stationary to the machine. Some of these apps might even be
&gt;&gt; the ones all the other apps should use as "hardware outputs" instead of
&gt;&gt; the real hardware outputs.
&gt;&gt; No problem when a) the session manager ignores these apps and b) the
&gt;&gt; project is not meant to be movable to a different machine.
&gt;&gt; By making session-management easier for 'most' people, todays
&gt;&gt; session-managers
&gt;&gt; break a) and forcefully support apps that don't want to be supported.
&gt;&gt; And as neither jack supports something like static port aliases nor
&gt;&gt; as session-managers correctly support the notion of distinct apps
&gt;&gt; as "the global environment", b) breaks. Because nowadays the session
&gt;&gt; connects to "alsa_pcm:playback_[12]" on one machine and has to connect
&gt;&gt; to "jconvolver:in_[12]" on another machine.

How this is not solved in ladish? This is exactly the reason for its
studio/room separation.

&gt;&gt; So while session management nowadays is easy for 'most' people and
&gt;&gt; use-cases, its actually made impossible for these special cases.
&gt;&gt; Special cases like: I have this super-cool ardour-project using two
&gt;&gt; dozen synths and playing out to my native home-cinema surround-set. And
&gt;&gt; the audio is so cool that I want to play the same project on one of the
&gt;&gt; bigger ambisonics/wfs setups at the next LAC. Only my project connects
&gt;&gt; to 'alsa_pcm:playback_[1-6]' and when I do that on the wfs-machine I am
&gt;&gt; lucky when nothing of the hardware breaks because I sent my bass-beats
&gt;&gt; to the highest speaker of a four-way...

This is solved years ago in ladish.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the app doesn't have support for jack session management how can
&gt;&gt;&gt; the session manager be in the way?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; See above, when you write a session-manager for audio and want it to be
&gt;&gt; used, you support apps that don't support you...

Yes, ladish can reconnect apps that don't know about session
support. Some other session management system can do it as well.

&gt;&gt; There are probably some easy solutions to these problems outlined
&gt;&gt; above. But its "special cases" and it seemed to me the last years that
&gt;&gt; many developers don't want to deal with this and don't want to listen
&gt;&gt; to the people that have to deal with this.

I dealed with this kind of special cases for years. Did I miss some of
them?

&gt; This all looks solveable to me. We have a few specific limitations. What
&gt; is the easiest way to enable the flexibility required?

install jackdbus and ladish :P

&gt;&gt; But I am happy if I am proven wrong: if there is a session-management
&gt;&gt; for audio-projects that knows which app is part of the project and
&gt;&gt; which is part of the environment. If there is even a session-management
&gt;&gt; that knows about something like "the environment" apart from
&gt;&gt; alsa_pcm.

ladish

&gt; We can assign static names to jack ports. IIUC, the main issue appears to
&gt; be that alsa i/o cannot be easily renamed/mapped in a session file.

jack aliases can do this for you but from my POV they are just a
workaround for the real problem. Obviously I think the way ladish solves
this issue is better :)

&gt; So do we need a way to override the jack portnames in the JACK API?
&gt;
&gt; Seems like a reasonable addition to the API to me.

we already have it - jack aliases (altrough i dont recommend using them)

&gt; Can you isolate the other issues that you feel would not be solved in this
&gt; case?

I'm interested in this as well.
