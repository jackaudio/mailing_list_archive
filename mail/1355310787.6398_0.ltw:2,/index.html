&gt;&gt;&gt; So do we need a way to override the jack portnames in the JACK API?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Seems like a reasonable addition to the API to me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; we already have it - jack aliases (altrough i dont recommend using them)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Are "jack aliases" unique to  LADISH? I haven't heard of them in the JACK
&gt; API?

jackdbus doesnt expose aliases (on purpose) and ladish doesnt use
them. There is WIP branch to use jack aliases as "transport" for better
default hardware client/port names. "default", because you can change
them later with ladish (or with jack aliases).

jack aliases are part of the jack api. both jack1 and jack2.

&gt; Maybe it would be helpful if you could give a step by step instruction on
&gt; how to achieve what Arnold is looking for with ladish and then we can test
&gt; it out to see if it does the trick?

1. Create studio. Studio stores and restores jack setup and
infrastructure jack apps like crossovers. Connections between hardware,
infrastructure jack apps and rooms (yes, you can have more than one) are
part of the studios.

2. Create room in the studio. Room has snake-like (multicore cable)
connection to studio. The room snake ports have well defined roles.

3. Connect room ports to other jack clients in the studio subgraph.

4. Start your non-infrastructure apps as part of the room and save them
as projects. You can connect jack apps to studio-link ports.

ladish has two types of "sessions". studios and rooms. The jack graph
can be split between studio and one or more rooms. Studio is "session"
that has only non-project specific part of the jack graph. Jack
management is also part of the studio. Studio has room definitions.

When you load and start the studio:
 * jack server is configured and started
 * infrastructure (studio) apps are started
 * studio app ports are reconnected once they appear in the jack graph.
 * rooms are recreated (without projects loaded in them

Then you load your project into suitable room. It is not implemented
yet, but the rooms can be created from room definitions stored in the
projects. Other think that is not implemented yet is custom
(user-defined) room templates. Right now they are all defined in the
code (still easy to add new ones).
