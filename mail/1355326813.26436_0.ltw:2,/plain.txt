I guess that depends on how confident you are that the ALSA snd_pcm_link()
implementation is the root of the JACK messages seen.

Is there any way to highlight the issue using native ALSA access?  I
haven't worked with the ALSA devs  before, I was thinking it might be
easier to get them interested in incorporating a change into upstream if
there was some way other than installing JACK and JACK aware applications
to make the problem show up.  If you just submit a patch and say this
change is needed, are the ALSA developers pretty good about accepting
patches without letting them sit around unmerged for a long time?
