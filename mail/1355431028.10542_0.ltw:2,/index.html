Hi,

I was thinking it was about time to upgrade jackd / ffado and a few
other bits, but i can't seem to get Jack 1.9.9 (multilib) to build on
my system (Archlinux 64bit + multlib). Previously, i was always able
to use the --mixed flag, which always worked just fine (and is also
the way my distro builds/packages jack2-multilib). But now it seems to
be broken.

here is a pastebin of the build failure; http://pastebin.com/VmfgqSQv

Note: building pure 64-bit works fine

I also tried to build 32bit jack separately, but didn't have much
luck. ~ but i can usually build other 32bit apps no problem, but i am
not sure what i need to do to make jack happy in this case.

Is there any chance that either A) Jackaudio.org will have proper
instructions for building multilib jack, now that --mixed no longer
works  or B) maybe fix --mixed, being as many people (and/or distro
packagers) use that build option.

I'd also like to avoid having to setup a 32bit chroot, being as i am
already using a multilib system - it's a big hassle to have to set one
up _just_ for jack. (and obviously, i've never needed one before, so i
shouldn't now).

Lastly, i did notice a discussion on this a month or so ago, but i was
under the impression that the --mixed flag was going to be kept...but
i may have missed part of the conversation. Anyways, any help, update
on the situation would be appreciated. It's not critical that i update
jack right now, but i thought since 1.9.9 is marked an actual release
~ it might be to my benefit to do so ;)

cheerz

Jordan
