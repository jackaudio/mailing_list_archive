AFAICS --mixed was supposed to be kept.

Anyone knows better?

Thanks.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking it was about time to upgrade jackd / ffado and a few
&gt; other bits, but i can't seem to get Jack 1.9.9 (multilib) to build on
&gt; my system (Archlinux 64bit + multlib). Previously, i was always able
&gt; to use the --mixed flag, which always worked just fine (and is also
&gt; the way my distro builds/packages jack2-multilib). But now it seems to
&gt; be broken.
&gt; 
&gt; here is a pastebin of the build failure; http://pastebin.com/VmfgqSQv
&gt; 
&gt; Note: building pure 64-bit works fine
&gt; 
&gt; I also tried to build 32bit jack separately, but didn't have much
&gt; luck. ~ but i can usually build other 32bit apps no problem, but i am
&gt; not sure what i need to do to make jack happy in this case.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any chance that either A) Jackaudio.org will have proper
&gt; instructions for building multilib jack, now that --mixed no longer
&gt; works  or B) maybe fix --mixed, being as many people (and/or distro
&gt; packagers) use that build option.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd also like to avoid having to setup a 32bit chroot, being as i am
&gt; already using a multilib system - it's a big hassle to have to set one
&gt; up _just_ for jack. (and obviously, i've never needed one before, so i
&gt; shouldn't now).
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, i did notice a discussion on this a month or so ago, but i was
&gt; under the impression that the --mixed flag was going to be kept...but
&gt; i may have missed part of the conversation. Anyways, any help, update
&gt; on the situation would be appreciated. It's not critical that i update
&gt; jack right now, but i thought since 1.9.9 is marked an actual release
&gt; ~ it might be to my benefit to do so ;)
&gt; 
&gt; cheerz
