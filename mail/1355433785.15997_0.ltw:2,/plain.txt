Hey Adrian,

First, thank you taking the time to offer some help. (it is always
greatly appreciated!)

> Does the previous release still builds on your current system, so we know for sure it's a  regression?

Indeed, i was just in the middle of verifying that 1.9.8 builds
correctly (as to not waste anyone's time), when you sent this email.

> If it is one, can you try to git bisect it?

It does appear to be a regression, i would say. ...and yes, i can do
that, but I've never actually used git-bisect, so any quick pointer
would be good. (note: i am just reading about git bisect, as we
speak).
