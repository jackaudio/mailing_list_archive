Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows 64bit - Jack has crashed

Hi Darin,

A couple of things...

When using ASIO4ALL and before starting Jack Control, does the
ASIO4ALL icon show on your taskbar? If so, is it green or red?

ASIO4ALL is an ASIO IO wrapper for your WDM/KS drivers and not a true
ASIO device. As such it accesses ALL WDM/KS devices, so if you have an
issue with one device then ASIO4ALL will fail unless that device is
deselected in the ASIO4ALL configuration panel. Configuring Jack to
use your true ASIO device eliminates this possibility.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
