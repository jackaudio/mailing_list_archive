So you're saying I shouldn't use ASIO4ALL? The devices I want to use do not have
ASIO drivers, only Windows drivers, so I assume I have to use ASIO4ALL in order
to access my audio devices.

So I can specify a MME or DirectSound device for input and output and then
access those devices with Jack? But I want to have my software see an 8 channel
input even though I don't have an 8 input sound card. I assume Jack can do that.

Like I said, ASIO4ALL works with all my devices. Jack is the only program I
can't seem to get to work.
