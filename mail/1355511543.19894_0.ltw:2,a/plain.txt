Yes, I see that now. I changed JackRouter.ini and everything is working. Thanks!

But as I get things working, I run into more problems.

Once I have everything running and patched as I want it works great, but once I
stop,pause, skip while playing a movie file from JRiver, my media player, Jack
will add new connections on it's own. How can I prevent Jack from altering the
connections when the output source stops or is interrupted? When I start the
media playing again, Jack connects the output of the media player directly to
the sound card output in addition to the connections I had previously.

Is there a way to prevent Jack or Jack Control from adding new connections
automatically?

Also, I noticed that I have to have all the audio programs running before the
patchbay preset will load. Is there a way to have Jack Control show me all the
inputs and outputs and connections even if the programs aren't running yet?

Let me know if I should start another thread.

Thanks,
-Darin
