this is the fault of the media player. its a common thing, not just on
windows. the player thinks that it is interacting with a h/w device, and so
it opens/closes its access to the device every time it starts and stops.
JACK can't do anything about this.

there are no inputs or outputs (related to programs) if the programs are
not running.

if you are discussing qjackctl (which i think you are), only its actual
"patchbay" and NOT the "connections" dialog shows "persistent" connections.
many people confuse these two dialogs - they are not the same thing at
all.
