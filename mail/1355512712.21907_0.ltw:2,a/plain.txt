windows. the player thinks that it is interacting with a h/w device, and so it
opens/closes its access to the device every time it starts and stops. JACK can't
do anything about this.

But when playback is resumed, is there a way to prevent qjackctl from creating
new connections?

qjackctl will create default connections in the connections dialog whenever
playback is resumed. If I could get it to stop doing that, then I think
everything else would resume OK.
