So I have a patchbay preset which is also set to persistent.

When I load that preset, the  connection dialog is exactly how I want it:

Media player channel 1-6 connected to VST host (which processes the 6 channels
down to 2)

VST host 2 channel output connected to my sound card 2 channel output.


BUT, when I pause or skip the movie on my media player, the connection panel
changes completely:

All 6 connections from my media player to VST host are deleted.
Then BOTH VST host 2 channel output is connected to sound card out AND media
player 2 ch output is connected to sound card output directly.

This happens the second I touch the playback position of the media player file.

So, qjackctl is automatically deleting a bunch of connections and creating one
that I never had in my patchbay preset or ever.

I can't figure out why it's assuming when playback resumes that I don't want any
of those connections any more.
