OK,

Here's a screen shot of the preset loaded that I want:

Here's a screen shot of the connection panel after I pause/resume or skip

This happens instantly once I touch the playback head in the media player.

BTW, I cannot right click on those connections and delete them. I have to
"delete all" to get rid of them and then reload my preset.
