Subject:     [Jack-Devel] netjack2 resampler

Dear all,
I'm taking a look at how resampling in audioadapter (used by netjack2) is done.
I expected to see some DSP (interpolation) but I see none. I looked at
JackResampler, JackAudioAdapter and ringbuffer. Am I expecting something wrong
 or did I miss the useful chunk of code? And if there is no interpolation, 
how is audioadapter supposed to resample between the two (not-in-sync) local
and remote audio card clocks?
Thanks in advance.
