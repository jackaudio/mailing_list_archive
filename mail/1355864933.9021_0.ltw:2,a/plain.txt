The original email was talking about thin clients, so I think in Jack
terminology it would be a machine running JACK 1.9.8 as slave and a second
machine running JACK 1.9.7 as master with a NetJACK-2 connection between
them.

Assumptions:
"client" refers to thin client, or what would be the X server, so would be
the JACK master since it is physically closest to the user.

"Server" refers to compute server, remote from the user, so would be
running JACK slave to connect applications on the remote machine to the
display and sound card on the client machine.

I think your objection was assuming that JACK server and JACK client meant
jackd and an application linked to jack running on the same machine, which
I think is not what the original author meant.
