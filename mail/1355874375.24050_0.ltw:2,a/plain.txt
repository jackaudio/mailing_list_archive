Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] mismatch between Mageia 2 (1.9.8) and TinyCore (1.9.7)

Yes, when I said "client", I meant the thin client machine that
has a soundcard--the JACK master if I understand JACK terminology
correctly.  When I said "server", I meant the compute server that
runs Firefox, MuseScore, MPlayer, etc.--the JACK slave if I
understand correctly.  Audio is passed between the two via
NetJACK2, if I understand that terminology correctly.

Running the exact same build of JACK on both sides would be the
ideal.  However, sometimes reality dictates that the two sides
are different distributions, and the exact same build is not
always available between distributions.  In this case, Mageia 2
on the JACK slave comes with 1.9.8 and TinyCore on the JACK
master comes with 1.9.7.

Based on the tone of the replies, I would guess there is no
compatibility mode or option or bridge between the 1.9.7 and
1.9.8 protocols.  Or is there?

The combination of 1.9.6 on the JACK slave (applications that
generate sound data) and 1.9.7 on the JACK master (soundcard)
worked when the slave was Mageia 1.  However, now with the 1.9.6
packages from Mageia 1 installed on Mageia 2, jack_lsp on the
JACK slave says "Cannot open lsp client" and "jack_client_open()
failed, status = 0x21".  The jackd process is running, and its
output doesn't have any apparent indication it isn't healthy and
happy.  Any suggestions to get slave jack_lsp and jack_connect
back on speaking terms with slave jackd?

Also, is the issue of "500 Internal Server Error" on the Wiki and
bugs pages being worked on?

Thanks again,

Robert Riches
