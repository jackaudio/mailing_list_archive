&gt; correctly.  When I said "server", I meant the compute server that
&gt; runs Firefox, MuseScore, MPlayer, etc.--the JACK slave if I

Those applications do not typically need low latency and extensive routing
flexibility, which is the reason JACK was developed.  It is possible that
using the network audio feature of PulseAudio is actually a better match
for what you are trying to do.

If you prefer to keep JACK, compiling from source is not difficult.

That is almost the latest.  1.9.9 was released just days ago. 1.9.8 is
probably OK to keep, but if you end up compiling from source might as well
get 1.9.9.

&gt; and TinyCore on the JACK master comes with 1.9.7.

TinyCore seems to do things differently than most other distributions.  It
looks like to get a newer version of JACK you will have to compile JACK
somewhere, whether that is possible on a machine actually running TinyCore
or not is unclear, then package that up as an "extension" somehow.
Seems like it should be possible to get a newer version of JACK on there,
but figuring out how to get it installed will probably be more work than
actually compiling JACK.
