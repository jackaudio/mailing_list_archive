Le 19 d&#xE9;c. 2012 &#xE0; 00:46, Robert M. Riches Jr. a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Yes, when I said "client", I meant the thin client machine that
&gt; has a soundcard--the JACK master if I understand JACK terminology
&gt; correctly.  When I said "server", I meant the compute server that
&gt; runs Firefox, MuseScore, MPlayer, etc.--the JACK slave if I
&gt; understand correctly.  Audio is passed between the two via
&gt; NetJACK2, if I understand that terminology correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; Running the exact same build of JACK on both sides would be the
&gt; ideal.  However, sometimes reality dictates that the two sides
&gt; are different distributions, and the exact same build is not
&gt; always available between distributions.  In this case, Mageia 2
&gt; on the JACK slave comes with 1.9.8 and TinyCore on the JACK
&gt; master comes with 1.9.7.
&gt; 
&gt; Based on the tone of the replies, I would guess there is no
&gt; compatibility mode or option or bridge between the 1.9.7 and
&gt; 1.9.8 protocols.  Or is there?

No compatibility mode.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of 1.9.6 on the JACK slave (applications that
&gt; generate sound data) and 1.9.7 on the JACK master (soundcard)
&gt; worked when the slave was Mageia 1.  However, now with the 1.9.6
&gt; packages from Mageia 1 installed on Mageia 2, jack_lsp on the
&gt; JACK slave says "Cannot open lsp client" and "jack_client_open()
&gt; failed, status = 0x21".  The jackd process is running, and its
&gt; output doesn't have any apparent indication it isn't healthy and
&gt; happy.  Any suggestions to get slave jack_lsp and jack_connect
&gt; back on speaking terms with slave jackd?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, is the issue of "500 Internal Server Error" on the Wiki and
&gt; bugs pages being worked on?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt; 
&gt; Robert Riches
&gt; 


My general way of looking at the problem is:

Netjack1 (Torben code) is the official system, since it is more general (LAN/WAN).

Netjack2 stay more experimental, so we at Grame do not especially work on maintaining compatibility mode between succesives evolutions of the protocol or whatever.
