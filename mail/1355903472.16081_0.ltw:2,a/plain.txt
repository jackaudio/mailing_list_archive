No compatibility mode.

My general way of looking at the problem is:

Netjack1 (Torben code) is the official system, since it is more general (LAN/WAN).

Netjack2 stay more experimental, so we at Grame do not especially work on maintaining compatibility mode between succesives evolutions of the protocol or whatever.
