Subject:     [Jack-Devel] no-self-connect patch for jack-1.9.9.5

People are asking for no-self-connect patch updated for the new 1.9.9.5
jack2 release. While one can always use the git no-self-connect branch
to build jack or generate patch, not everybody knows how to use git. So
Iâ€™ve made a p1 patch and uploaded it.

The patch itself and a PGP signature for it:

 * http://nedko.arnaudov.name/soft/jack/jack2-no-self-connect-1.9.9.5.patch
 * http://nedko.arnaudov.name/soft/jack/jack2-no-self-connect-1.9.9.5.patch.sig

or if you want to use HTTPS and have ipv6:

 * https://ipv6.nedko.arnaudov.name/soft/jack/jack2-no-self-connect-1.9.9.5.patch
 * https://ipv6.nedko.arnaudov.name/soft/jack/jack2-no-self-connect-1.9.9.5.patch.sig
