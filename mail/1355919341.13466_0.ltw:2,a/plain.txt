Hi Shlomo,

Have you followed the Installation and Configuration section of the
Using Jack on Windows page on the Jack wiki?

http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows

----

For a list of all the audio devices on your system that Jack can
connect to, open a Command Prompt, change directory to the Jack folder
(i.e. cd "c:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\") then run this command: jackd
-d portaudio -l (that's an 'ell' for List, not a 'one') , this will
present you with the list of supported devices.

-----

You can then use this information to modify the jackd command so that
Jack connects to your ASIO device. This is step 5 of the Installation
and Configuration section.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
