Ooops! Sorry for feeding you incorrect info Shlomo! I must admit I've never
used JACK under Windows and I was under the impression it would require
apps offer native support. I thought Windows JACK would be nigh on useless
still but if it can connect any ASIO apps then I can see it being useful.
Also, apologies to Paul as it seems the list is getting my postings after
all! :)

The JACK on Windows page says that only Musescore and fooyc20 support JACK
natively under Windows. What about Mixbus, Supercollider and PD? I've not
tried any of those under Windows but I'd be surprised if they didn't have
native JACK support under their Windows versions?
