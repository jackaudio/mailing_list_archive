Well, depending on how we define "native" here! :-)  Praxis LIVE works
directly with the JACK API on Windows, as does anything created with
it.  The underlying JNAJack Java bindings work on Windows, so anything
built with them should work as a "native" JACK Windows application.  I
don't have a definitive list, but judging from the support requests,
contributions, etc. people are creating things with it.

Best wishes,
