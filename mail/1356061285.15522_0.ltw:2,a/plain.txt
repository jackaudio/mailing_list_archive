Subject:     [Jack-Devel] zero-mode semaphores; system:capture never appearing on slave

Thanks for all the suggestions about the mismatch problem between
Mageia 2's 1.9.8 and TinyCore's 1.9.7.  After building a system
with compilation tools, Python, OpenSSL, and ALSA dev in order to
compile JACK, I got a 1.9.8 compiled for TinyCore, and things are
much better.  That even gave me a jack_wait binary that Mageia
omits.

Two problems remain with the NetJACK2 setup:

1) Sometimes, apparently around 10-20% of the time, the slave
side gets a /dev/shm/sem.jack_sem.${uid}_... file that appears
several seconds after its siblings, and the latecomer has zero
permissions, which causes lots of 'permission denied' errors.  It
appears that was the root cause of a lot of the jack_lsp failing
to start the client.  Any idea what would create such a file?
For now, I do an 'rm -f' on that path before attempting to start
anything on the slave side.

2) On the slave side, JACK port "system:capture" never appears.
With 1.9.6-1.9.7, it would pretty reliably appear after at few
seconds.  For now, I can ignore the capture side and just do
playback.  Was "system:capture" supposed to go away in 1.9.8?

I'm using command options that _should_ open two playback and two
capture channels.  Come to think of it, on the master side, only
the playback channels exist.  Might this be due to the master
side not opening the capture ports?

Thanks,

Robert Riches
