Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Install Latest version.

Subject: Persistent JACK problems.

Hello jack-devel,

I have found JACK to be inconsistent and frustrating on my Ubuntu PC,
probably the only thing which has made me even consider going back to
Microsoft.

I would like to install the latest version to see if it helps. Can you
give me the
terminal commands please?

Thank you for any assistance.

Chris.
