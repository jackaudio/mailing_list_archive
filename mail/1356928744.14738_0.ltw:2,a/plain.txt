Subject:     [Jack-Devel] NetJACK playback sounds like XRuns, but none reported

Running a NetJACK 2 setup for simple two-channel playback to a
thin/zero-client machine, audio sounds chopped, as if there is
a constant stream of XRuns at a rate of about 5-10 per second.
However, even with all stdout/stderr sent to log files and
with the "-v" option on all JACK programs, there's no mention
of XRuns.  JACK is 1.9.8 on both sides.

The network connection between the two machines is private,
dedicated gigabit ethernet.  VNC displays over that network
cable, but it uses a fairly small fraction of the available
bandwidth.  When I was running 1.9.6 and 1.9.7, audio quality
was very good with very few (if any) audible XRuns--which I
believe were reported in the log files.

If the Wiki were functioning, would it have any suggestions
for solving this type of problem?

Thanks,

Robert Riches
