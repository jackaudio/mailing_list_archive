Subject:     [Jack-Devel] L_ProAudio: A Linux Proaudio FrameWork with improved Wine/kernel(rt) support

I've been working of some software that is and/is of linux and thought
this would be a nice way to ring in the new year :)

Announcing L_ProAudio (Alpha / preview / for you... but stable as hell for me!);

https://sourceforge.net/projects/l-proaudio/

L_ProAudio is a combination of software and an idea towards better
integration of linux-rt / jack / Wine, along with improved theming and
(hopefully) other useful tools/scripts/etc ~ that could be used as
sort of a meta-package for people whom want these tools to work
together nicely. (and i am hoping some collaboration and feedback).

L_ProAudio consists of two critical components;

1. L_proAudio Kernel: This (-rt)kernel carries my personal delta (if
you will. ie: what i use on my H/W). There are too many too go
through, but they are cherry-picked with linux proaudio use (including
wine) *very specifically*. I have rebased my picks against kernel
3.6.11-rt25, respectably. a few named; rebasing the worthwhile
(almost) majority of Muse Research's Kernel patches; things like
delayed acpi, indirect fan control, tame conntrack, etc... using Bao
Mao / Google patch to revert stable_page_write - since it seems to be
the #1 bugger/cuprit (not hard to maintain
Google/BaoMao/Oracle/SanSung/etc do it for you :) ...you can look for
your self though.

* the sources come from the main files markes XXX-Arch_n_sources,
* the folders contain pre-patched kernel for your disposal / testing.
* XXX-Arch_n_sources contains reference PKGBUILDs > could be used as
build instructions
* XXX-Arch_n_sources contains all .patch files (ordering when patching
is probably important, for at least 2-3 of them)

2. L_ProAudio Enhanced Wine(-rt): This version of wine is not bound to
wineserver with RT (it introduces new threading/priority model
MUSE_RT_THREAD) - some apps that interface with wine should be
adapted, if possible, at least as an option :) ~ this patch is
obviously marked (cant remember the name, right now). LPA Wine has a
TON on fixes and improvements for proaudio users, it's staggering.
Patches from Muse, galore - devs should have a look :) i also took the
time and fixed theming of menu lines by hooking them into windows
'desktop color'. ie: theming wine is _much_ better. I am also nearly
done an integrated gtk+ / cinnamon / wine theme that will be available
with L_ProAudio. more on that and more cherry-picks to come.

* the sources come from the main files markes XXX-Arch_n_sources,
* the folders contain pre-patched kernel for your disposal / testing.
* XXX-Arch_n_sources contains reference PKGBUILDs > could be used as
build instructions
* XXX-Arch_n_sources contains all .patch files (ordering when patching
is probably important, for at least 2-3 of them)

NOTE: L_ProAudio is only tested as a cohesive unit - ie: I
occasionally re-base this (when it is deemd fit). So i can't promise,
what your mileage will be using one or the other. For example; the
kernel is 'tuned' specifically to make wine a happy camper (now,
generally speaking, it has a positive impact on
performance_non_wine_related, but still not promising anything :)

Tools you will need (aside from :

=working LPA kernel
=working LPA Wine installation w/ 32-bit wine prefix
=working jack (jack2/multilib tested pretty heavily)
=wineASIO
=FSThost
=some plugins

I would love some feedback, people to package / test / etc.

I don't have a wiki setup yet, nor GIT ~ but i will setup both shortly
(no rush, i will push it out with the next set of patches that i am
working on :)

Happy new year, everbody!
