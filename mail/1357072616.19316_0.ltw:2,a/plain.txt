Hello Jordan,

Interesting stuff and thanks for sharing! I have some questions though:
* what is delayed acpi?
* what is indirect fan control?
* what is tame conntrack?
* what is stable_page_write?
* how do the above things influence Linux audio performance?
* why 3.6? Aren't there still some issues with it (softirq related stuff)?

Thanks!

Jeremy
