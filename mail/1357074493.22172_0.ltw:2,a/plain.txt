You're very welcome. I've also just responded to you in the
linuxmusicians forums. ( i signed up in part to track you down / make
an announcement).

Please get back to me with your experiences and feedback. You are one
of the people whom i wanted to get right no this; since you provide
many useful tools/packages in Ubuntuland.  Ideally, if you end up
packaging it - i would like to keep sourceforge in sync with your
packages both debs/source debs (which i will update, as you update
your repos).

drop me a line anytime :)

Jordan
