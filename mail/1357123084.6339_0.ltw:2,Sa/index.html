I've got your merge request, but before that:

- please keep testing (and possibly netjack2 between 64 and 32 machines)

- I would like to test on Windows also (see if it does not break MixBus for instance...)

&gt;&gt; And there was Basil Nutmeg proposal in july 2012 that was finally prepared on a git branch here:

&gt; As documented in the git log messages, it breaks the ABI. AFAIK that is
&gt; a no-go.

&gt; Quotes from the commit log:
&gt; 
&gt; In the current tree, with packed attributes on the relevant structs,
&gt; the only impact of this change is that the alignments of jack_unique_t
&gt; and jack_time_t are increased from 4 to 8 on 32-bit platforms, so
&gt; the layouts of structs which include them as members may be affected.
&gt; 
&gt; The ABI impact relative to the tree before the packed attributes
&gt; were introduced is that the alignment of jack_position_t is increased
&gt; from 4 to 8 on 32-bit platforms. The layout of the struct itself is
&gt; unmodified, though the layouts of structs which include it as a
&gt; member may be affected.
&gt; 
&gt; jack_latency_range_t and jack_position_t are no longer packed. The
&gt; layouts of these structs themselves are unmodified, though the layouts
&gt; of any structs which include these structs as members may be affected.
&gt; ---
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Then Robin it would be great to look at this code and possibly test
&gt;&gt; (= merge or rebase) it with latest git head and see if it works.
&gt; 
&gt; Basil's work can be rebased without any conflicts onto the current HEAD.
&gt; It needs some minor modifications (JackNetTool.h) to compile:
&gt;  https://github.com/x42/jack2/commits/nopackedstructs
&gt; and then works as promised - tested on arm and i386.
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly enough, the ABI changes do not seem to make a difference
&gt; on i386 nor on armel. (basil's jackd2 was configured with --classic
&gt; --alsa --dbus --firewire).
&gt; 
&gt; On i386: Ardour3, xjadeo, zita-a2j (all compiled with jack2-1.9.9) as
&gt; well as baudline continue to work just fine with initial tests. On arm I
&gt; only tested some commandline tools jack_capture, jltcgen. No problems
&gt; either, so far.
&gt; 
&gt; so long,
