Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Stream audio live ("what I'm listening to") via WLan/UPnP with Windows using Jackaudio

Hello there,

I would like to stream audio live ("what I'm listening to") to my WD TV 
Live via WLan/UPnP with Windows7 or 8.

I have a solution with commercial software: Asset UPnP. After 
installation it has build a virtual-soundcard and a UPnP-mediaserver, 
which I can just start in my WD TV Live menu on the TV screen. Then it 
plays the audio "what I'm listening to" from my laptop. So far so good, 
but it is commercial...

I would like to ask you if there is a similar solution possible with 
Jackaudio? I configured Jack, so I have a virtual-soundcard, which I can 
see already in my audio-mixers in Windows. What I need now is to 
configure a mediaserver that streams the audio from the 
virtual-soundcard and which I can start in my WD TV Live, similar to the 
solution with Asset UPnP.

Thanks for your help!
David
