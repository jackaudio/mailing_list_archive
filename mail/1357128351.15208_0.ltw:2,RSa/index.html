&gt; As documented in the git log messages, it breaks the ABI. AFAIK that is

&gt;
&gt; In the current tree, with packed attributes on the relevant structs,
&gt; the only impact of this change is that the alignments of jack_unique_t
&gt; and jack_time_t are increased from 4 to 8 on 32-bit platforms, so
&gt; the layouts of structs which include them as members may be affected.
&gt;
&gt; The ABI impact relative to the tree before the packed attributes
&gt; were introduced is that the alignment of jack_position_t is increased
&gt; from 4 to 8 on 32-bit platforms. The layout of the struct itself is
&gt; unmodified, though the layouts of structs which include it as a
&gt; member may be affected.
&gt;
&gt; jack_latency_range_t and jack_position_t are no longer packed. The
&gt; layouts of these structs themselves are unmodified, though the layouts
&gt; of any structs which include these structs as members may be affected.

The jack1/jack2 ABI breakage that happened because of the packed structs
is much more worrisome.
