Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Stream audio live ("what I'm listening to") via WLan/UPnP with Windows using Jackaudio

Hi there,
i'm afraid i don't have an answer to your question.
but you say you already have Jack-control virtual soundcard showing up in
your windows audio mixer?
How did you manage that? Because from what I know there is no jack client
that can be used as sound sink to redirect audio to jack..
Is there a guide that you followed?
any sort of help will be valuable.
Thank you!
