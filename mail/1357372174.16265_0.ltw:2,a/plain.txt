Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Merge Firewire Device

Hi,

I found the below documentation which explains how to "aggregate" 
multiple Audio devices:

http://jackaudio.org/multiple_devices

My question is if anyone has an experience with this and my specific 
device.  I have two Presonus Firebox's which have essentially 4 inputs 
and 6 outputs each.  I'm looking to merge two of these firewire devices 
for a recording project I have coming up; I need more Phantom Power XLR 
inputs, ect.

Any advice, or tips you can provide would be helpful.  I plan on hooking 
these up Monday for some initial testing.

Side question:  The device has 2 firewire ports on the back.  I know 
Presonus doesn't auto-support daisy chaining on this device.  But, would 
the other port act as a Firewire "through".  Else, I'll have to hook up 
a second firewire PCI card.

Thanks,
Tim H.
