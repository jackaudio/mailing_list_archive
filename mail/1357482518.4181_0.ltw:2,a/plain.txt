Erm, didn't mean to send that just yet!

     1. 63 characters isn't long enough for all my jack ports, e.g.
        "a2j:M Audio Audiophile 24/96 [20] (playback): M Audio
        Audiophile 24/96 MIDI"
     2. Jack 1 doesn't call the graph order handler because the client
        does not have a process handler, so no connections are shown.
