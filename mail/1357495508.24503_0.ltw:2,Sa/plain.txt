Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] njconnect

It is already activated. I added a dummy process handler and now the
graph order callback is handled.

However, there is now another issue:

In jack 1, jack_port_get_connections() can only be used for the client's
own ports.

        Parameters:
        	port	locally owned jack_port_t pointer.

Documentation for jack_port_get_all_connections() states:

        This differs from jack_port_get_connections() in two important
        respects:

        2) You need not be the owner of the port to get information
        about its connections.

So the method of getting all port connections is wrong, sadly.
