Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] njconnect

Hello all,

Thanks a lot for all reports. You got me - I only tested it in Jack2, but will try Jack1 later.
Getting connections bug is just stupid typo, but this didn't defend me ;-)

About requirement of "process" callback, I leave things as-is and wait for Jack1 devs (Paul ?) for state is bug or not, but IMHO it is.

Port/Connections lists should be also refreshed after connection/disconnection and you can always manually hit "r".

Pawel
