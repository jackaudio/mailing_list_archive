Various distributions make horrendous errors and questionable judgements in
their packaging of JACK.

Right now, for example, despite the fact that Jack2 and Pulse will
interoperate quite nicely, it fails to work on current Ubuntu releases
unless the user installs an extra, rather obscure package.

Please do NOT direct mail about issues like this to JACK developers (though
using this mailing list is OK). We have no control over how distributions
do this stuff. The ones that get it right ... get ir right. The ones that
get it wrong ... need bug reports filed in their bug trackers.

what makes you believe that JACK is targetted at casual users?

I guess you're new around here. First of all, it appears that you have not
read the FAQ entry of JACK and PulseAudio.

Most developers of JACK do not use PulseAudio and do not consider
"integration" with Pulse (beyond what is currently done) to be a useful
goal.

They do NOT replicate the same purpose. I have no idea what level of
understanding of JACK you have if you believe this to be true.

read the FAQ.

we provide the techology. distributions screw it up. ubuntu has been one of
the worst, but it far from the only distribution to cause absurd levels of
"pain" for people who want to use JACK.

there are much deeper issues with linux audio that need to be resolved if
the kind of "mess" you are really referring to are ever going to be
addressed. fixing those issues requires a more authoritarian approach to
developers and APIs than the linux ecosystem makes possible. it worked for
apple because they can simply tell people what to do. you cannot do this
with linux, and as a result, the "deep" problems (none of which are
mentioned in your mail) are very, very hard to solve.
