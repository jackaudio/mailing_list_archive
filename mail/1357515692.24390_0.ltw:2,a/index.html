&gt;&gt; The point is that JACK is only ever as good as the environment that it
&gt;&gt; sits in. For JACK to be acceptable it really needs to be more user
&gt;&gt; friendly. For example, I had to contact this team to find out that
&gt;&gt; JACK doesn't work well unless Ubuntu Studio is installed as well.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Various distributions make horrendous errors and questionable judgements  
&gt; in
&gt; their packaging of JACK.
&gt;
&gt; Right now, for example, despite the fact that Jack2 and Pulse will
&gt; interoperate quite nicely, it fails to work on current Ubuntu releases
&gt; unless the user installs an extra, rather obscure package.
&gt;

Which package are you reffering to?
If you're suggesting pulseaudio-module-jack, that piece of code belongs to  
Pulseaudio, and it's only purpose is to automatically create sink and  
source for PA to jack. Which it does, if it's installed separately. It  
doesn't handle grabbing the card at all.

Ubuntu imports directly from Debian. I haven't gone deeper into looking at  
the specifics, but the code is the same. And I can't believe the packaging  
is doing much to change how jack behaves.

As it seems, jack2 is not able to grab the card from PA in all situations.  
It works better when PA is not actively using the card for something. In  
this case, it works 100% of the time for me.
I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the code, and not with the packaging  
anyhow.
