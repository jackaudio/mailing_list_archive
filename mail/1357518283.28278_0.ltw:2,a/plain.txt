I gave up on distribution-provided audio packages a long time ago. Too 
many fixes for issues I dealt with were too recent. I maintain a page on 
my personal wiki specifically for setting up my audio stack from scratch 
after a fresh re-install of anything debian-based. (The only difference 
for RHEL derivatives should be package names.)

These steps work. Rip out all the garbage that Ubuntu and Ubuntu Studio 
polluted your system with and do what this page says. Your experience 
will be much better.
