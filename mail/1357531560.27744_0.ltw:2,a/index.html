&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is that JACK is only ever as good as the environment that it
&gt;&gt;&gt; sits in. For JACK to be acceptable it really needs to be more user
&gt;&gt;&gt; friendly. For example, I had to contact this team to find out that
&gt;&gt;&gt; JACK doesn't work well unless Ubuntu Studio is installed as well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Various distributions make horrendous errors and questionable judgements
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; their packaging of JACK.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Right now, for example, despite the fact that Jack2 and Pulse will
&gt;&gt; interoperate quite nicely, it fails to work on current Ubuntu releases
&gt;&gt; unless the user installs an extra, rather obscure package.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Which package are you reffering to?
&gt; If you're suggesting pulseaudio-module-jack, that piece of code belongs to
&gt; Pulseaudio, and it's only purpose is to automatically create sink and
&gt; source for PA to jack. Which it does, if it's installed separately. It
&gt; doesn't handle grabbing the card at all.
&gt;
&gt; Ubuntu imports directly from Debian. I haven't gone deeper into looking at
&gt; the specifics, but the code is the same. And I can't believe the packaging
&gt; is doing much to change how jack behaves.
&gt;

Ubuntu do not import directly from Debian. They have their own
professional packaging team who purposefully fucked up pulseaudio support
for many years. Recently (in the past two years) they have gotten better
because Mark Shuttleworth stepped in and made some changes to the team)
but this specific issue of pulse and jack integration is a regression IMO
which is caused by poor QA by the packagers and should have been picked up
before it went into the repos.

&gt; As it seems, jack2 is not able to grab the card from PA in all situations.
&gt; It works better when PA is not actively using the card for something. In
&gt; this case, it works 100% of the time for me.
&gt; I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the code, and not with the packaging
&gt; anyhow.


Its a known bug in pulseaudio. Jack does not take over the soundcard from
PA. Pulseaudio releases it and if "autospawn" is disabled it will allow
jack to use it.

The Debian package maintainers are aware of the issue but as yet there has
not been a fix for it.

If you want perfect pulseaudio support then you should use Fedora as
Redhat sponsor development of Pulseaudio whereas debian is maintained by
volunteers.

I've never heard of jack wiping out graphics drivers. That sounds like a
dodgy harddrive or someone was making system wide changes on the
commandline and zapped some libs that were in the same folder by accident.
