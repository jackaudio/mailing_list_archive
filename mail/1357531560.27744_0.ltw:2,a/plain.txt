Ubuntu do not import directly from Debian. They have their own
professional packaging team who purposefully fucked up pulseaudio support
for many years. Recently (in the past two years) they have gotten better
because Mark Shuttleworth stepped in and made some changes to the team)
but this specific issue of pulse and jack integration is a regression IMO
which is caused by poor QA by the packagers and should have been picked up
before it went into the repos.

Its a known bug in pulseaudio. Jack does not take over the soundcard from
PA. Pulseaudio releases it and if "autospawn" is disabled it will allow
jack to use it.

The Debian package maintainers are aware of the issue but as yet there has
not been a fix for it.

If you want perfect pulseaudio support then you should use Fedora as
Redhat sponsor development of Pulseaudio whereas debian is maintained by
volunteers.

I've never heard of jack wiping out graphics drivers. That sounds like a
dodgy harddrive or someone was making system wide changes on the
commandline and zapped some libs that were in the same folder by accident.
