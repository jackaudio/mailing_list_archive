Hi Stephane.  Which compiler(s) are we talking about on ARM?  Currently, PRE_PACKED_STRUCTURE and POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE are only implemented if either __GNUC__ is defined or _MSC_VER.  However, they can be expanded to accommodate future requirements (other compilers).  So if the ARM compiler was gcc it should have worked.  Or if it wasn't gcc or MSVC it could have been added to the list.

No, to be fair I haven't looked at the new approach but I'd be happy to consider it.  I just wanted to make the point that whatever you've done, for some structs the alignment HAS changed.  And if it needs to change, the most promising layout is 1-byte packing.  Whilst (in theory) compilers should be able to agree about any given packing arrangement, in practice, 1-byte packing is the only arrangement whose layout leaves no room for doubt.  Compilers are almost bound to agree about 1-byte packing.

Yes, I agree Stephane.  I just wanted to point out that this is the right time to be having this discussion and that whatever we agree upon, it needs to be supported by most compilers (which 1-byte packing is).  However, if you're confident that JACK_ALIGN is also supported by most compilers, I don't have a problem with it.  I just don't want us to find out the hard way that JACK_ALIGN is another arbitrary alignment scheme when a (theoretically good) scheme already exists...  :-)
