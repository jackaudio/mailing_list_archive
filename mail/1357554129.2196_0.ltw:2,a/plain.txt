It is not only a problem of jack. GNU/Linux is following the same path
than the other mainstream OS: the never the better.

At the first place, I never understood the need of PA when we get a
constant sound latency with jack. The tremendous efforts made on PA
would have been much better spend on a better integration of jack.
Hopefully, we have the snd-aloop module that made possible to interface
alsa and jack. But unfortunately, most distributions just don't provide
this module.

Also, I don't want things like policy-kit to pollute my system and be
the cause of several regressions (auto-mounting that doesn't work
any more, printer that doesn't work without reconfiguring it, X that
doesn't start because my window manager doesn't know nothing about
polkit, ...). And both PA and gnome depends on polkit.

On gentoo, the solution to purge all this mess is quite simple:

USE="-consolekit -policykit -udisks -udisks2 -upower -pulseaudio"
emerge world

This will definitely remove the whole of gnome including PA. For kde,
the easy way is to let portage to remove it as well. You can reinstall
most parts of it later.

All the gentoo portage desktop profiles do include polkit, so I made 2
gentoo polkit-free desktop profiles, one for kde, the second for the
other WM (work with those that doesn't have polkit as must have
dependency). They are now part of the pro-audio gentoo overlay. To use
them, install the overlay, change the profile, and update the system as
usual.

It is some extra USE flags into the proaudio-kde profile, that in order
to get ride of the semantic-desktop (this speed-up kde a lot according
to kde users):
"-raptor -redland -semantic-desktop -virtuoso"
You will have to use something like claws-mail instead of kmail with
this profile. If you want semantic-desktop, the other profile will
be fine.

Also, most of the audio related USE flags are included in both profiles.
