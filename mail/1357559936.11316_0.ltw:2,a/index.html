&gt; No Stephane - 1-byte packing is essential if there's a possibility that
&gt; the server and its clients might get built using different compilers.
&gt;

I repeat my belief that attempting to support this goal is not sensible
when at least two of the "target" compilers (a) handle alignment quite
differently (b) have different target processors available (c) have
different conceptions of "standards". On the other hand, I understand the
goal and think that it is correct too - telling users that client A cannot
work with Jack-built-with-foo because A was built with compiler bar is
pretty horrendous. The conflict between these two things is ugly.

I think that you (John) are missing the issue with alignment. It is not
that gcc on ARM cannot implement single-byte packing. The problem is that
the processor will raise an exception when attempting to load or store
values when this alignment violates the rules for the processor. whether an
exception is raised depends on the load/store instructions which in turn
depends on the data types. It is not a compiler error but a programmer
error to request/force byte-aligned packing of data types that cannot be
byte aligned. Pointer aliasing and/or union-based access in C requires the
compiler to assume that the developer knows what they are doing (modern gcc
can warn about the issues in some cases). The same issue was true on the
DEC Alpha in the early 1990s, and caused exactly the same kinds of
development problems. I remember many entirely legal C/C++ programs that
would crash and burn on the alpha because they failed to heed alignment
requirements (often by forcing the compiler to ignore them).
__attribute__((packed)) means, in part, "i know what i am doing".
