&gt; &gt; I think that you (John) are missing the issue with alignment. It is not
&gt; that gcc on ARM cannot implement single-byte packing. The problem is that
&gt; the processor will raise an exception when attempting to load or store
&gt; values when this alignment violates the rules for the processor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I understand what you're saying Paul but I'm afraid I can't agree - unless
&gt; ARM is some kind of special case.  I can see your point about
&gt;  __attribute__((packed)) meaning "I know what I'm doing" and I'm sure that
&gt; used to be the case with older architectures but things have moved on.
&gt;  Where a compiler supports struct packing (and at the point when the data
&gt; needs to get presented to the CPU) it's the compiler's job to re-adjust the
&gt; data as needed, to match the CPU's preferred alignment.  Of course, if the
&gt; compiler can't handle that for some reason it should issue a warning, just
&gt; like you said - but if the compiler simply presents misaligned data to the
&gt; CPU, then the compiler doesn't really support packing.
&gt;

there is nearly always more than 1 way to skin a cat or pack a C structure.
if __attribute__((packed)) has *any* room for interpretation, or if there
is more than 1 way to pack a given structure to follow processor rules,
then it does not accomplish your stated goal of ensuring compatible
structure layouts between compilers.

and i want to remind all readers that this discussion is ONLY about that.
this has nothing to do with 32/64 issues. it is solely about  ways to
compile JACK with a compiler that uses one packing convention and end up
with something usable by a client built with a different compiler.
