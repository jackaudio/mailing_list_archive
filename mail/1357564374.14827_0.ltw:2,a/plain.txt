Yes, Paul is right.  The 32-bit / 64-bit issue is only loosely connected to the topic of struct packing.  It's really significant benefit is the ability to allow a server built with one compiler to connect with clients built using a different compiler.  I'm assuming that would be a desirable goal for NetJack (?)

But we might be arguing unnecessarily here.  The first thing I should do is to test the new JACK_ALIGN strategy and see if it works as well as 1-byte packing used to work.  If it does, then there's no problem.
