It's really significant benefit is the ability to allow a server built with one compiler to connect with clients built using a different compiler. I'm assuming that would be a desirable goal for NetJack (?)

The issue here is only desirable for clients using the *public* jack headers (like type.h, jack.h)

We don't need to ensure that a server (so libjackserver.xx) compiled  with a given compiler can safely interact with the client side library (libjack.xx) compiled with another one. This has never been the goal! We assume that a JACK distribution always pack server and client side libraries compiled in a coherent manner (same compiler).

OK.
