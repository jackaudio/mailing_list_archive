I completely concur.

server+compiler "foo" interacting with libjack+compiler "bar" is not
something we should even be thinking about.

we've spent years telling users that (a) you cannot have two versions of
JACK installed (b) JACK is a system comprised of a server and a library.

I can see no reason to put any effort whatsoever into supporting a
mixed-compiler build of the server and library. it is just insane.
