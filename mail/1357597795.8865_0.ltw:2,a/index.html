I read "struct packing", "packing alignment" and "alignment".

We should not mix terminology. Let's have a look at

   http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.0/gcc/Type-Attributes.html

It says:

  aligned (alignment)
  This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for variables
  of the specified type.

Helpful in the 32/64bit case. Maybe also for gcc/MSVC.

For packing:

   packed
   This attribute, attached to struct or union type definition,
   specifies that each member (other than zero-width bitfields) of the
   structure or union is placed to minimize the memory required.

This would work for 32/64 and gcc/MSVC on x86, since it supports
unaligned access, but breaks ARM. One could argue at great length what
"minimize" means, but apparently, it means "as small as (im)possible,
never mind the alignment requirements".


And then, there is another possibly helpful attribute:

   ms_struct
   gcc_struct
   If packed is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used it may be
   that the Microsoft ABI packs them differently than GCC would normally
   pack them. Particularly when moving packed data between functions
   compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler (either via
   function call or as data in a file), it may be necessary to access
   either format. Currently -m[no-]ms-bitfields is provided for the
   Microsoft Windows X86 compilers to match the native Microsoft
   compiler.


So this leaves us with the following options:

   a) use aligned and provide the proper alignment size OR
   b) use packed and disable it on ARM
   c) use ms_struct on gcc Win x86


Robin provided a patch for b) which may or may not break arm64. We have
an almost working patch for a) if we hardcode sizeof(double) in the MSVC
case. AFAIK, we haven't explored c).

If c) turns out to be working, one could combine it with a), leave
sizeof() to gcc-non-Windows and everybody is happy.


And now arm the compilers and figure out what's actually working. ;)



Cheers
