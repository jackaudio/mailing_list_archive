Paul - it really is essential for Windows.  Because of problems that are inherent in gcc's link lib (libjack.lib) we need to build libjack using MSVC, even though we actually throw our DLL away and use Stephane's.  If we didn't use the MSVC built libjack.lib, users would be stuck with whatever version of Jack gets shipped with Mixbus and they'd never be able to update it.
