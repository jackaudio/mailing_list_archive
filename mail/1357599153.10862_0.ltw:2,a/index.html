Some interesting ideas there Adrian.  I feel sure that they key to solving this problem is to realise that packing (in particular) need not be identical on the different platforms.

It's very late here tonight and my brain is past its bedtime - but I think some good ideas have come out of this discussion.

&gt;&gt; Historically (as Paul described earlier) struct packing was a way of
&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt; penalty in changing a compiler's default packing alignment.  This is
&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt; cases).  To me, this suggests that if JACK_ALIGN is working on that
&gt;&gt; particular compiler, it's most likely a happy accident.
&gt; 
&gt; I read "struct packing", "packing alignment" and "alignment".
&gt; 
&gt; We should not mix terminology. Let's have a look at
&gt; 
&gt;   http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.0/gcc/Type-Attributes.html
&gt; 
&gt; It says:
&gt; 
&gt;  aligned (alignment)
&gt;  This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for variables
&gt;  of the specified type.
&gt; 
&gt; Helpful in the 32/64bit case. Maybe also for gcc/MSVC.
&gt; 
&gt; For packing:
&gt; 
&gt;   packed
&gt;   This attribute, attached to struct or union type definition,
&gt;   specifies that each member (other than zero-width bitfields) of the
&gt;   structure or union is placed to minimize the memory required.
&gt; 
&gt; This would work for 32/64 and gcc/MSVC on x86, since it supports
&gt; unaligned access, but breaks ARM. One could argue at great length what
&gt; "minimize" means, but apparently, it means "as small as (im)possible,
&gt; never mind the alignment requirements".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And then, there is another possibly helpful attribute:
&gt; 
&gt;   ms_struct
&gt;   gcc_struct
&gt;   If packed is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used it may be
&gt;   that the Microsoft ABI packs them differently than GCC would normally
&gt;   pack them. Particularly when moving packed data between functions
&gt;   compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler (either via
&gt;   function call or as data in a file), it may be necessary to access
&gt;   either format. Currently -m[no-]ms-bitfields is provided for the
&gt;   Microsoft Windows X86 compilers to match the native Microsoft
&gt;   compiler.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So this leaves us with the following options:
&gt; 
&gt;   a) use aligned and provide the proper alignment size OR
&gt;   b) use packed and disable it on ARM
&gt;   c) use ms_struct on gcc Win x86
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Robin provided a patch for b) which may or may not break arm64. We have
&gt; an almost working patch for a) if we hardcode sizeof(double) in the MSVC
&gt; case. AFAIK, we haven't explored c).
&gt; 
&gt; If c) turns out to be working, one could combine it with a), leave
&gt; sizeof() to gcc-non-Windows and everybody is happy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And now arm the compilers and figure out what's actually working. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
