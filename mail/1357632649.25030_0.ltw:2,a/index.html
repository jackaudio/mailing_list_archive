&gt; The documentation for the Microsoft compiler points out that if you pack
&gt; your data structures, you may need to use the _unaligned attribute when
&gt; accessing the struct to let the compiler know that extra code needs to be
&gt; generated to handle the unaligned data.  The _unaligned directive does
&gt; nothing on some platforms, but adds the additional code on platforms where
&gt; it is needed.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; GCC does not seem to have the equivalent of the _unaligned directive, so
&gt; on platforms which can not handle unaligned access, either the programmer
&gt; must add the additional required code by hand, or avoid packing structures
&gt; in ways which cause unaligned access.
&gt; 

Yes, that's exactly right Chris.  What we know now (but didn't know back then) is that some compilers don't perform automatic re-alignment.  I think this is telling us that we'll need to adopt a hybrid approach, with different strategies for different platforms.

For example, I'm 99% certain that JACK_ALIGN won't work with MSVC - not even if we can solve the sizeof() issue.  It'll work if we only use it for data types whose size happens to be a power of 2.  But if we ever needed to implement (for example) a 'jack_long_double' type, JACK_ALIGN would fall over (in fact, that should probably be checked for gcc too).  In any event, it's debatable whether JACK_ALIGN is even needed on Windows, where 1-byte packing alone seems to be sufficient (unless Stephane knows different).  Up to now, 1-byte packing seems to be delivering 32-bit / 64-bit compatibility for us, although the acid test will come when we build a 64-bit version of Mixbus.

Admittedly hybrid, platform-dependent approaches are ugly but I think this is one situation where it's entirely justified.

Yes, they are incompatible but I think we've largely addressed those issues.  This time last year, Stephane and I had to do a lot of work to eliminate situations where MSVC was trying release memory which gcc had allocated etc.  I think that's all covered now (famous last words!)
