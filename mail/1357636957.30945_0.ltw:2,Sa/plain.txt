Adrian / Stephane,

When applied completely in isolation, that patch does compile.  However, there are 2 problems:-

        1)  It won't guarantee 1-byte packing which seems to be what we need for Windows.
        2)  MSVC won't allow alignment of arguments in a function declaration.

Here's an example of problem 2, taken from JackCleint.h but there are literally hundreds of such cases:-

        JackClient.h
                virtual int SetSyncTimeout(jack_time_t timeout);

        and the error is:-
                error C2719: 'timeout': formal parameter with __declspec(align('8')) won't be aligned

It's rather annoying that this can't be a warning rather than an error but as you can see, it's an error.  I don't think we should get too despondent about this, since PRE and POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE haven't yet been removed so there's still the possibility of a hybrid solution.  It's much better that we find this our now, before we'd abandoned 1-byte packing altogether.  :-)
