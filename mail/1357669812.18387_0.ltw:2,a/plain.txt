Oh, and of course we'd need to disable JACK_ALIGN and JACK_ALIGNED_TYPE on Windows.

Which brings up another point...  it looks as if the currently aligned types all happen to be 8 bytes in size.  Conveniently, 8 is a power of 2 but would the alignment continue working (on ARM say, or OS-X) if the variable's size wasn't a power of 2?
