&gt; Hi all again,
&gt; I am having new problems with jackd2, after our embedded platform switched
&gt; to the 3.1 kernel.
&gt; Actually, I think they were present with our previous kernel as well, but
&gt; they have become systematic while once they were sporadic.
&gt;
&gt; I think I have found the problematic code, but I need some insight from
&gt; someone that knows the code.
&gt; The first problem I am seeing is a very high number of xrun notifications,
&gt; tens of them a second.

You can use -s, --softmode  to disable xrun reporting


&gt; They is due to alsa_driver_wait() returning with 0 as its frame number,
&gt; which normally means an xrun has occurred, but in this case what seems to
&gt; be happening is that jack_wait returns "normally", but with a
&gt; capture_avail of 0 and a playback_avail of 512 on 9 calls out of 10. The
&gt; tenth call I get both capture_avail and playback_avail set to 512. The
&gt; wait_status is set to 0, as in "everything normal", I guess, and so I
&gt; tried to modify JackAlsaDriver to skip the notification in this case, and
&gt; things seem to be working fine, no noticeable glitches in the audio
&gt; playback at all.
&gt;
&gt; The second problem I was referring to is that this high number of
&gt; notifications is triggering a problem in the JackRequest code:
&gt; The CheckRes() macro checks for errors from the Read/Write calls, but
&gt; these calls may silently fail: they can return without writing or reading,
&gt; and this is accounted as success, but then Read() may return uninitialized
&gt; data or Write is not retried when it should.
&gt;
&gt; There is code like this:
&gt;
&gt;          CheckRes(JackRequest::Write(trans));
&gt;          CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fName, sizeof(fName)));
&gt;          CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fProtocol, sizeof(int)));
&gt;          CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fOptions, sizeof(int)));
&gt;          CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fUUID, sizeof(int)));
&gt;
&gt; Where I think after each Write there is potential for a needed retry,
&gt; which is not done at all. Am I missing something?
&gt;
&gt; I am using Jackd2 1.9.8, but the affected code has changed little in the
&gt; latest git revisions.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for your support,
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Luciano Montanaro
