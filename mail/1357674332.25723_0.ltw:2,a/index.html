Le 8 janv. 2013 &#xE0; 20:13, MONTANARO Luciano (MM) a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Hi all again,
&gt; I am having new problems with jackd2, after our embedded platform switched to the 3.1 kernel.
&gt; Actually, I think they were present with our previous kernel as well, but they have become systematic while once they were sporadic.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I have found the problematic code, but I need some insight from someone that knows the code.
&gt; The first problem I am seeing is a very high number of xrun notifications, tens of them a second.
&gt; They is due to alsa_driver_wait() returning with 0 as its frame number, which normally means an xrun has occurred, but in this case what seems to be happening is that jack_wait returns "normally", but with a capture_avail of 0 and a playback_avail of 512 on 9 calls out of 10. The tenth call I get both capture_avail and playback_avail set to 512. The wait_status is set to 0, as in "everything normal", I guess, and so I tried to modify JackAlsaDriver to skip the notification in this case, and things seem to be working fine, no noticeable glitches in the audio playback at all.

Cannot answer here: what ALSA gurus think of the possible fix?

&gt; 
&gt; The second problem I was referring to is that this high number of notifications is triggering a problem in the JackRequest code:
&gt; The CheckRes() macro checks for errors from the Read/Write calls, but these calls may silently fail: they can return without writing or reading, and this is accounted as success, but then Read() may return uninitialized data or Write is not retried when it should.
&gt; 
&gt; There is code like this:
&gt; 
&gt;         CheckRes(JackRequest::Write(trans));
&gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fName, sizeof(fName)));
&gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fProtocol, sizeof(int)));
&gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fOptions, sizeof(int)));
&gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fUUID, sizeof(int)));
&gt; 
&gt; Where I think after each Write there is potential for a needed retry, which is not done at all. Am I missing something?

CheckRes was supposed to fail in case of error?

Any log of the problem to show?
