the original issue arose from situations where a 32 bit client wants to
interact with a 64 bit server (or vice versa). that required that any
structs in the public API (there are two) were packed identically
regardless of the target word size. this has two dimensions - one being the
compiler used and one being the word size, but we pretty much ignored
compiler variations other than to make sure that the macros that were used
to ensure the packing matched would work.

then a second issue arose, almost entirely because john wants to run a
version of libjack compiled with msvc(++) in combination with a server
built with gcc. this requires that EVERY struct in the private
server/library "API" also be packed identically - in this case across
compiler variations.

finally, a third issue came up whereby the packing used to try to solve the
second issue broke things on ARM.

&gt; I find the path of this discussion somewhat difficult to follow, since it
&gt; seems to have wandered back and forth a bit between 64 bit/32 bit
&gt; compatibility, and what ARM can and cannot handle, and considerations of
&gt; using gcc and MSVC together in a single project.
&gt;
&gt; Could someone who actually understands the root of the problem write up a
&gt; concise summary of the start of the problem, the original proposed
&gt; solution, and why that did not actually work?
&gt; I would find that extremely helpful to tie together all the emails from
&gt; the past week.
