&gt; the original issue arose from situations where a 32 bit client wants to interact with a 64 bit server (or vice versa). that required that any structs in the public API (there are two) were packed identically regardless of the target word size. this has two dimensions - one being the compiler used and one being the word size, but we pretty much ignored compiler variations other than to make sure that the macros that were used to ensure the packing matched would work.
&gt; 
&gt; then a second issue arose, almost entirely because john wants to run a version of libjack compiled with msvc(++) in combination with a server built with gcc. this requires that EVERY struct in the private server/library "API" also be packed identically - in this case across compiler variations. 
&gt; 
&gt; finally, a third issue came up whereby the packing used to try to solve the second issue broke things on ARM.
&gt; 

That sums the situation up pretty well but there's a fourth dimension which I must admit, I still don't fully understand.

The proposed solution to the first problem was JACK_ALIGNED_TYPE but I'm still not convinced about its validity.  Would the solution have worked universally or was it only working because the aligned types all happened to be 8 byes wide?
