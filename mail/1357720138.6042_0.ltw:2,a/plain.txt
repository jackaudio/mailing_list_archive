That sums the situation up pretty well but there's a fourth dimension which I must admit, I still don't fully understand.

The proposed solution to the first problem was JACK_ALIGNED_TYPE but I'm still not convinced about its validity.  Would the solution have worked universally or was it only working because the aligned types all happened to be 8 byes wide?
