&gt; Le 8 janv. 2013 &#xE0; 20:13, MONTANARO Luciano (MM) a &#xE9;crit :&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; Hi all again,&#13;
&gt; &gt; I am having new problems with jackd2, after our embedded platform&#13;
&gt; switched to the 3.1 kernel.&#13;
&gt; &gt; Actually, I think they were present with our previous kernel as&#13;
&gt; &gt; well, but&#13;
&gt; they have become systematic while once they were sporadic.&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; I think I have found the problematic code, but I need some insight&#13;
&gt; &gt; from&#13;
&gt; someone that knows the code.&#13;
&gt; &gt; The first problem I am seeing is a very high number of xrun&#13;
&gt; &gt; notifications,&#13;
&gt; tens of them a second.&#13;
&gt; &gt; They is due to alsa_driver_wait() returning with 0 as its frame&#13;
&gt; &gt; number,&#13;
&gt; which normally means an xrun has occurred, but in this case what seems&#13;
&gt; to be happening is that jack_wait returns "normally", but with a&#13;
&gt; capture_avail of&#13;
&gt; 0 and a playback_avail of 512 on 9 calls out of 10. The tenth call I&#13;
&gt; get both capture_avail and playback_avail set to 512. The wait_status&#13;
&gt; is set to 0, as in "everything normal", I guess, and so I tried to&#13;
&gt; modify JackAlsaDriver to skip the notification in this case, and&#13;
&gt; things seem to be working fine, no noticeable glitches in the audio playback at all.&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; Cannot answer here: what ALSA gurus think of the possible fix?&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; The second problem I was referring to is that this high number of&#13;
&gt; notifications is triggering a problem in the JackRequest code:&#13;
&gt; &gt; The CheckRes() macro checks for errors from the Read/Write calls,&#13;
&gt; &gt; but&#13;
&gt; these calls may silently fail: they can return without writing or&#13;
&gt; reading, and this is accounted as success, but then Read() may return&#13;
&gt; uninitialized data or Write is not retried when it should.&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; There is code like this:&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt;         CheckRes(JackRequest::Write(trans));&#13;
&gt; &gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fName, sizeof(fName)));&#13;
&gt; &gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fProtocol, sizeof(int)));&#13;
&gt; &gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fOptions, sizeof(int)));&#13;
&gt; &gt;         CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fUUID, sizeof(int)));&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; Where I think after each Write there is potential for a needed&#13;
&gt; &gt; retry, which&#13;
&gt; is not done at all. Am I missing something?&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; CheckRes was supposed to fail in case of error?&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Yes, but the JackClientSocket::Read/Write functions return 0 if len != returned length.&#13;
So CheckRes is fine with them.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; Any log of the problem to show?&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&#13;
A log showing the problem is attached.&#13;
The interesting lines are near the end, but maybe you can spot something else that is useful.&#13;
&#13;
The cause of the abort is that Jack seem to receive ConnectPorts with a -1 port id, but as you can see, at line 10311, there is an "Unknown Request -1", and a similar one at line 10125.&#13;
&#13;
Thank you,&#13;
Luciano&#13;
