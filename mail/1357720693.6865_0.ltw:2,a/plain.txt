Yes, but the JackClientSocket::Read/Write functions return 0 if len != returned length.
So CheckRes is fine with them.

A log showing the problem is attached.
The interesting lines are near the end, but maybe you can spot something else that is useful.

The cause of the abort is that Jack seem to receive ConnectPorts with a -1 port id, but as you can see, at line 10311, there is an "Unknown Request -1", and a similar one at line 10125.

Thank you,
Luciano
