OK.

I would recommend trying latest git (1.9.10). Some work was done between 1.9.8 and current version in this area (event if I think the solution is still not so good...)

Can you try and report?

Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Le 8 janv. 2013 &#xE0; 20:13, MONTANARO Luciano (MM) a &#xE9;crit :
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all again,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am having new problems with jackd2, after our embedded platform
&gt;&gt; switched to the 3.1 kernel.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, I think they were present with our previous kernel as well, but
&gt;&gt; they have become systematic while once they were sporadic.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think I have found the problematic code, but I need some insight from
&gt;&gt; someone that knows the code.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The first problem I am seeing is a very high number of xrun notifications,
&gt;&gt; tens of them a second.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They is due to alsa_driver_wait() returning with 0 as its frame number,
&gt;&gt; which normally means an xrun has occurred, but in this case what seems to
&gt;&gt; be happening is that jack_wait returns "normally", but with a capture_avail of
&gt;&gt; 0 and a playback_avail of 512 on 9 calls out of 10. The tenth call I get both
&gt;&gt; capture_avail and playback_avail set to 512. The wait_status is set to 0, as in
&gt;&gt; "everything normal", I guess, and so I tried to modify JackAlsaDriver to skip
&gt;&gt; the notification in this case, and things seem to be working fine, no
&gt;&gt; noticeable glitches in the audio playback at all.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cannot answer here: what ALSA gurus think of the possible fix?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The second problem I was referring to is that this high number of
&gt;&gt; notifications is triggering a problem in the JackRequest code:
&gt;&gt;&gt; The CheckRes() macro checks for errors from the Read/Write calls, but
&gt;&gt; these calls may silently fail: they can return without writing or reading, and
&gt;&gt; this is accounted as success, but then Read() may return uninitialized data or
&gt;&gt; Write is not retried when it should.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; There is code like this:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;        CheckRes(JackRequest::Write(trans));
&gt;&gt;&gt;        CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fName, sizeof(fName)));
&gt;&gt;&gt;        CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fProtocol, sizeof(int)));
&gt;&gt;&gt;        CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fOptions, sizeof(int)));
&gt;&gt;&gt;        CheckRes(trans-&gt;Write(&amp;fUUID, sizeof(int)));
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Where I think after each Write there is potential for a needed retry, which
&gt;&gt; is not done at all. Am I missing something?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; CheckRes was supposed to fail in case of error?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but the JackClientSocket::Read/Write functions return 0 if len != returned length.
&gt; So CheckRes is fine with them.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Any log of the problem to show?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A log showing the problem is attached.
&gt; The interesting lines are near the end, but maybe you can spot something else that is useful.
&gt; 
&gt; The cause of the abort is that Jack seem to receive ConnectPorts with a -1 port id, but as you can see, at line 10311, there is an
&gt; "Unknown Request -1", and a similar one at line 10125.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Luciano
