But the problem with ABI mismatches between jack1 and jack2 is not
solved. Or rather jack2 and any other jack implementation that
uses the non-packed structs in the API headers. Or I am missing
something?

Thus the current "force alignment" approach is not good. Because
alignment (at least in gcc) specifies minimum alignment, not enforced
one. You can request 8 but get 16.

JACK code should either

use natural alignment (all components are built with same ABI) and get
all but 32/64 bit (wine) problems solved

or

use the packed structs with explicit padding approach and get all
problems solved with more work by JACK developers.
