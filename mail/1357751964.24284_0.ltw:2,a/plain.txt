Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Odp: Graph callback and client state

Hi,

About second question.
I can't find in API anything for how check is client is active.
I put my nose into Jack1 code and find this (jackd/engine.c)

	if (!srcclient->control->active) {
		jack_error ("cannot connect ports owned by inactive clients;"
			    " \"%s\" is not active", srcclient->control->name);
		return -1;
	}

I have two ideas:
- jack_port_is_active() API call for check state of srcclient->control->active

- return some special code from jack_connect

What do you thing about that ?

BTW. can someone know how it is with inactive ports in Jack2 ?

Pawel
