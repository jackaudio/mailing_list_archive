Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK and CGroup

2 questions regarding CGroup and JACK.

1) It was a discussion it was some months ago regarding CGroup. Work
for a patch to jack that will make CGroup aware of all the process
running in jack was started. What is the status of this patch and can
we expect to see it in jack in some future?

2)  # cat /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
give me 950000 and
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us
give me 1000000

The difference is 50000. According to the kernel documentation, the
kernel need this time to insure that the non rt task will run reliably.

With this setup:

namespace {
	cpu = /;
}

group rtaudio {
	perm {
		task {
			uid = root;
			gid = audio;
		}
		admin {
			uid = root;
			gid = root;
		}
	}
	cpu {
		cpu.rt_runtime_us = 950000;
	}
}

I get a rtaudio real-time group. But the kernel do also have some
real-time tasks. That imply that both rtaudio and the kernel will share
exactly the same amount of time for their real-time tasks. So for the
question. Will such a setup interfere with the real-time tasks of the
kernel?

Or with other words, is it better to have a cpu.rt_runtime_us value of
900000 or something like that?

Ciao,
Dominique
