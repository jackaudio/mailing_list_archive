I really don't see the point.. It seems to me that their need is exactly the purpose of PulseAudio no? Moreover if their audio server is going to "take the audio card" (possibly a exclusive manner right?) how other audio applications (PA based or JACK based...) are going to work at the same time? Or do they want this new audio server to completely replace everything? A new audio API (!?!)

Hum....
