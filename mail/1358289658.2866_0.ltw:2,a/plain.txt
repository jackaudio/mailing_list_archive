Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK in Chrome !!

You've almost capture what I was about to add, Sam:

In ChromeOS, the only thing talking to the sound card is Chrome... you
can't install any local apps (apps in the traditional sense... not web
apps). So, there is no contention between different apps, just Chrome. At
the moment, all they are doing is having Chrome talk to the ALSA driver.
So, this is a step up from that very simple implementation.
