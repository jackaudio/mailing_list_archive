&gt; In ChromeOS, the only thing talking to the sound card is Chrome... you
&gt; can't install any local apps (apps in the traditional sense... not web
&gt; apps). So, there is no contention between different apps, just Chrome. At
&gt; the moment, all they are doing is having Chrome talk to the ALSA driver.
&gt; So, this is a step up from that very simple implementation.
&gt;

I agree with Stephane on thins one. What is with Google and having to
reinvent the Linux Audio Stack. They did it with Audio Flinger with the
result that Android is still useless for pro audio applications and now
they want to do it with ChromeOS too by effectively rewriting pulseaudio
and JACK.

These guys are really taking the piss.

&gt;&gt; I really don't see the point.. It seems to me that their need is exactly
&gt;&gt; the purpose of PulseAudio no? Moreover if their audio server is going to
&gt;&gt; "take the audio card" (possibly a exclusive manner right?) how other
&gt;&gt; audio
&gt;&gt; applications (PA based or JACK based...) are going to work at the same
&gt;&gt; time? Or do they want this new audio server to completely replace
&gt;&gt; everything? A new audio API (!?!)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hum....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If this is the ChromeOS in the new chromebooks, I think the idea is that
&gt;&gt; there aren't going to be a lot of applications requesting the sound
&gt;&gt; card,
&gt;&gt; and most of it is going to be stuff written for ChromeOS.    For the
&gt;&gt; most
&gt;&gt; part, ChromeOS is just enough of an operating system to run the browser.
