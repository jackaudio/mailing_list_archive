I don't know. I think there is a definite advantage to having an audio
server that can cover both Jack and PulseAudio use cases. I do think that
this is one of the areas that OSX has it right. I love Jack but it would be
nice if it's features were "always on". By this I mean if that this new
audio server (or a modification of Jack) could be run in the background at
all times then I think that pro audio on linux will be much more flexible
and simple.

In OSX I can run Jack on top of CoreAudio and still have functionality of
non-jack applications without restarting them or wrapping them into Jack at
the same time. If I close Jack then those applications are still working.
If I decide to pipe the output of one of those applications into a Jack
application then I can do that as well, without the application needing to
be written in a special way to take advantage of it (just using CoreAudio).

If there was a way for Jack to be set up like this reliably (ie. major
distributions being able to and confident to have this enabled by default)
then there would be no need for such a thing. My understanding of Jack,
however is that it is not flexible enough to do this and cope with dynamic
adding and removing of sound devices etc. Perhaps something from PulseAudio
can be pulled out into a (say) PulseAudioCore or something similar and then
both PulseAudio and Jack can live on top of it? I assume from the amount of
hate that PulseAudio gets that this wouldn't please too many people though.

I think the *idea* of a low level library that can satisfy both sides (in
the way CoreAudio does for OSX) and allow simultaneous operation is a great
one though.

&gt; &gt; In ChromeOS, the only thing talking to the sound card is Chrome... you
&gt; &gt; can't install any local apps (apps in the traditional sense... not web
&gt; &gt; apps). So, there is no contention between different apps, just Chrome. At
&gt; &gt; the moment, all they are doing is having Chrome talk to the ALSA driver.
&gt; &gt; So, this is a step up from that very simple implementation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I agree with Stephane on thins one. What is with Google and having to
&gt; reinvent the Linux Audio Stack. They did it with Audio Flinger with the
&gt; result that Android is still useless for pro audio applications and now
&gt; they want to do it with ChromeOS too by effectively rewriting pulseaudio
&gt; and JACK.
&gt;
&gt; These guys are really taking the piss.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I really don't see the point.. It seems to me that their need is exactly
&gt; &gt;&gt; the purpose of PulseAudio no? Moreover if their audio server is going to
&gt; &gt;&gt; "take the audio card" (possibly a exclusive manner right?) how other
&gt; &gt;&gt; audio
&gt; &gt;&gt; applications (PA based or JACK based...) are going to work at the same
&gt; &gt;&gt; time? Or do they want this new audio server to completely replace
&gt; &gt;&gt; everything? A new audio API (!?!)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hum....
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; If this is the ChromeOS in the new chromebooks, I think the idea is that
&gt; &gt;&gt; there aren't going to be a lot of applications requesting the sound
&gt; &gt;&gt; card,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and most of it is going to be stuff written for ChromeOS.    For the
&gt; &gt;&gt; most
&gt; &gt;&gt; part, ChromeOS is just enough of an operating system to run the browser.
