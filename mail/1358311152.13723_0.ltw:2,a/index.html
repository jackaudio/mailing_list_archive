I am aware of the ability for pulse to be wired through jack, but as far as
I am aware jack does not play well in a "consumer" setup - plugging in and
out sound cards etc. If it worked correctly in this case then I think it
would be a great default.

An example (on a laptop for instance):

soundcard1: onboard with builtin speakers
soundcard2: onboard with headphones (autodetected)
soundcard3: usb or firewire interface

laptop boots up and all sound is routed through soundcard1. user plugs in
headphones and (optionally) all sound routes through headphones. user
starts ardour and works on project. user wants to record a guitar and plugs
in soundcard3. (optional) popup asks user if they wish to use newly
detected card as the primary device. if so then all sound is now routed
through soundcard3. if not then soundcard3's inputs and outputs are
available in the list.

obviously there are issues with sync etc with multiple cards at once on one
application, so either this would have to be warned against or only
accessible by manually patching things. this sounds complex but is almost
identical to how OSX does it. it saves a lot of hassle and means that a
"consumer" build or distro is also ready to go as a pro setup (as OSX is
ready to go without needing to install various packages to get 'pro audio'
working).

note that this isn't an 'OSX is better than Linux' post - i use linux
almost exclusively other than for some audio work that requires certain
virtual instruments.

&gt; &gt; I don't know. I think there is a definite advantage to having an audio
&gt; &gt; server that can cover both Jack and PulseAudio use cases. I do think that
&gt; &gt; this is one of the areas that OSX has it right. I love Jack but it would
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; nice if it's features were "always on". By this I mean if that this new
&gt; &gt; audio server (or a modification of Jack) could be run in the background
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; all times then I think that pro audio on linux will be much more flexible
&gt; &gt; and simple.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In OSX I can run Jack on top of CoreAudio and still have functionality of
&gt; &gt; non-jack applications without restarting them or wrapping them into Jack
&gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; the same time. If I close Jack then those applications are still working.
&gt; &gt; If I decide to pipe the output of one of those applications into a Jack
&gt; &gt; application then I can do that as well, without the application needing
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; be written in a special way to take advantage of it (just using
&gt; &gt; CoreAudio).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If there was a way for Jack to be set up like this reliably (ie. major
&gt; &gt; distributions being able to and confident to have this enabled by
&gt; default)
&gt; &gt; then there would be no need for such a thing.
&gt;
&gt; It is already possible to route pulseaudio through jack. The system will
&gt; automatically reconfigure itself if you have the correct pulse-jack
&gt; configuration.
&gt;
&gt; Fedora gets this right ootb but Debian and Ubuntu packagers have made it
&gt; an optional manual configuration step.
&gt;
&gt; My suggestion is to write a blog post about why Ubuntu and Debian
&gt; packagers don't see the obvious benefit of making pulse and jack play
&gt; together nicely ootb.
&gt;
&gt; The other option is that the pulse team just hardwire this functionality
&gt; into pulse but that means they have to add testing pulse-jack integration
&gt; into their QA procedures. However as long as nothing changes dramatically
&gt; in the existing system configuration this should just be a minor test
&gt; procedure to run before a major release.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; My understanding of Jack,
&gt; &gt; however is that it is not flexible enough to do this and cope with
&gt; dynamic
&gt; &gt; adding and removing of sound devices etc. Perhaps something from
&gt; &gt; PulseAudio
&gt; &gt; can be pulled out into a (say) PulseAudioCore or something similar and
&gt; &gt; then
&gt; &gt; both PulseAudio and Jack can live on top of it? I assume from the amount
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; hate that PulseAudio gets that this wouldn't please too many people
&gt; &gt; though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think the *idea* of a low level library that can satisfy both sides (in
&gt; &gt; the way CoreAudio does for OSX) and allow simultaneous operation is a
&gt; &gt; great
&gt; &gt; one though.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In ChromeOS, the only thing talking to the sound card is Chrome... you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can't install any local apps (apps in the traditional sense... not web
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; apps). So, there is no contention between different apps, just Chrome.
&gt; &gt;&gt; At
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the moment, all they are doing is having Chrome talk to the ALSA
&gt; &gt;&gt; driver.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, this is a step up from that very simple implementation.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I agree with Stephane on thins one. What is with Google and having to
&gt; &gt;&gt; reinvent the Linux Audio Stack. They did it with Audio Flinger with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; result that Android is still useless for pro audio applications and now
&gt; &gt;&gt; they want to do it with ChromeOS too by effectively rewriting pulseaudio
&gt; &gt;&gt; and JACK.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; These guys are really taking the piss.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I really don't see the point.. It seems to me that their need is

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the purpose of PulseAudio no? Moreover if their audio server is going
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; "take the audio card" (possibly a exclusive manner right?) how other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; audio
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; applications (PA based or JACK based...) are going to work at the
&gt; &gt;&gt; same
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time? Or do they want this new audio server to completely replace
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; everything? A new audio API (!?!)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hum....
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If this is the ChromeOS in the new chromebooks, I think the idea is
&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there aren't going to be a lot of applications requesting the sound
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; card,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and most of it is going to be stuff written for ChromeOS.    For the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; most
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; part, ChromeOS is just enough of an operating system to run the
&gt; &gt;&gt; browser.
