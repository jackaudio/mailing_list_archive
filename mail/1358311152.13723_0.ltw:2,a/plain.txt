Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK in Chrome !!

I am aware of the ability for pulse to be wired through jack, but as far as
I am aware jack does not play well in a "consumer" setup - plugging in and
out sound cards etc. If it worked correctly in this case then I think it
would be a great default.

An example (on a laptop for instance):

soundcard1: onboard with builtin speakers
soundcard2: onboard with headphones (autodetected)
soundcard3: usb or firewire interface

laptop boots up and all sound is routed through soundcard1. user plugs in
headphones and (optionally) all sound routes through headphones. user
starts ardour and works on project. user wants to record a guitar and plugs
in soundcard3. (optional) popup asks user if they wish to use newly
detected card as the primary device. if so then all sound is now routed
through soundcard3. if not then soundcard3's inputs and outputs are
available in the list.

obviously there are issues with sync etc with multiple cards at once on one
application, so either this would have to be warned against or only
accessible by manually patching things. this sounds complex but is almost
identical to how OSX does it. it saves a lot of hassle and means that a
"consumer" build or distro is also ready to go as a pro setup (as OSX is
ready to go without needing to install various packages to get 'pro audio'
working).

note that this isn't an 'OSX is better than Linux' post - i use linux
almost exclusively other than for some audio work that requires certain
virtual instruments.
