When I read about what Google's been doing regarding sound in its linux projects, I'm reading exactly this between the lines.    The political situation regarding sound in Linux has always been a bit strange, even going back to the days before ALSA when I had to buy OSS modules to get my laptop working.

If Google's new project cleans up sound in Linux and brings it a little closer to something like CoreAudio, great.  That said, JACK scratches a slightly different itch for me.  Otherwise, why would I run JACK on a system that has CoreAudio already on it?
