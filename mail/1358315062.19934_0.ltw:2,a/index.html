&gt;&gt; I find it sad and incredibly frustrating that an organisation like
&gt;&gt; Google
&gt;&gt; prefers to pay people to reinvent open source audio causing significant
&gt;&gt; pain and suffering rather than contribute to the existing infrastructure
&gt;&gt; so everyone can benefit from their funded efforts.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ("It's broken" | "It's politically inexpedient"  | "It uses a bad license"
&gt; | "It's written in perl") so I'm chucking it in the bin and starting
&gt; over!! is also sometimes part of the Open Source way.   It's how projects
&gt; like GNOME get started.
&gt;

But in this case Google have already made it impossible for pro audio on
Android causing myself and many others to abandon Android as a development
platform for pro audio projects. Now they are intending to do the same
thing with ChromeOS which means that there will be more reasons not to use
Google solutions for pro audio. Considering that Android is the most
popular Linux system on the planet and that Chromebooks are the biggest
selling notebook on Amazon that means we are loosing market opportunities
for professional audio software running on Linux systems.

If Google are purposefully trying to hobble or holdback pro
audio/multimedia on Linux then they are going about it exactly the right
way. We see similar things with companies like AMD in regards to open
source multimedia solutions.
