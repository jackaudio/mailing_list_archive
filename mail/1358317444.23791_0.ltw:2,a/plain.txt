Pro audio is clearly not a concern on ChromeOS by design.   It's a single-purpose, single-application, essentially disposable computing platform.   Initial versions didn't even have windows, just the browser running full screen and tabs to go along with it.   The only reason I would hook my pro gear up to it is if I wanted to use one of my nicer mics for Google Voice, and even then I'd still probably use my studio workstation.

In this case I think it's more a missed opportunity than anything else.  And as you make clear Android is an entirely different bag of potatoes.   If we wanted a large company throwing down for Linux sound, Valve would probably be a better standard bearer than Google nowadays.
