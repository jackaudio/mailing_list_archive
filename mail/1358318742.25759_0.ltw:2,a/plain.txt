On Debian based we achieve this with an installable pulseaudio module,  
called pulseaudio-module-jack. If you install it, pulse will autoconnect  
to jackdbus. How does Fedora do it?

If you do extremem low latency work, you might not want the module active,  
as it may cause xruns. Thus, having the option to install it separately  
makes sense.

I wouldn't call this manual configuration, unless you meant installing the  
module itself is manual configuration. And let's not forget that achieving  
realtime privilege already does require manual configuration on systems  
where the user is not a member of audio group, on Debian based systems.

Perhaps you could explain what you mean by that here, so there is no need  
to write a blog about it.
