Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Console based software EQ for JACK

Hello

My music server is headless (no graphical environment).
I'm using mpd + JACK to play music.
Now I need some software equalizer (JACK based of course), but running
in daemon mode.

JackEQ is the application I currently installed. It could be run in
daemon mode like that:
$ jackeq -d

But I don't understand how to use it further more:
- how to connect it (to mpd in my case) ?
- how to adjust bass and treble ?
