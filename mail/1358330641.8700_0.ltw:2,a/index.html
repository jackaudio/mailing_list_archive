&gt; This is the process for enabling jack and pulse on Debian systems.
&gt;
&gt; 1: Add the user to the audio group

On Debian, the user is already a member of the audio group, but not on  
Ubuntu.

&gt; 2: logout of the desktop to apply the changes to the user priviledges
&gt; 3: install "pulseaudio-module-jack"
&gt; 4: disable autospawn by manually editing the ~/pulse/client.conf file
&gt;
&gt;     autospawn = no
&gt;
&gt; 5: restart pulseaudio
&gt;
&gt;     pulseaudio -k
&gt;     pulseaudio -D
&gt;

If this is required for you to get jackdbus grab the card from pulseaudio  
(by killing pulseaudio before starting jack), then you'd have to do the  
same on any system with the same version of pulseaudio and jack. The  
reason to that is what you explain at 7:, namely, pulseaudio suffering  
 from a bug making it not release the card at certain circumstances.

&gt; 6: start jack
&gt;
&gt; 7: It may also be necessary to restart the computer after all these
&gt; changes to make sure pulse releases the device to jack. Especially if the
&gt; user as already being playing audio through pulse. This is a known bug
&gt; with pulse and dbus not releasing the device properly.
&gt;
&gt; For the average user this is a relatively routine procedure but for the
&gt; n00b user these steps are daunting and challenging requiring a large
&gt; amount of background knowledge and definitely a frustrating user
&gt; experience.
&gt;
&gt; With Fedora I did not have to do any of that to get jack to work for me.
&gt; However I am not sure what has happened with f17/18.
&gt;

What version of pulseaudio and jack? Which Fedora release? How is  
pulseaudio and jack configured differently on Fedora?

So far, I'm not seeing any distro specific problem. Only buggy code. And  
 from what I've read, there may be more than one bug causing problems in  
pulse and jack integration.
