On Debian, the user is already a member of the audio group, but not on  
Ubuntu.

If this is required for you to get jackdbus grab the card from pulseaudio  
(by killing pulseaudio before starting jack), then you'd have to do the  
same on any system with the same version of pulseaudio and jack. The  
reason to that is what you explain at 7:, namely, pulseaudio suffering  
 from a bug making it not release the card at certain circumstances.

What version of pulseaudio and jack? Which Fedora release? How is  
pulseaudio and jack configured differently on Fedora?

So far, I'm not seeing any distro specific problem. Only buggy code. And  
 from what I've read, there may be more than one bug causing problems in  
pulse and jack integration.
