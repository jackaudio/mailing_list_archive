Which is wrong on so many levels.

Mostly, because the draft is about ChromeOS, not Linux in general.

Second, because they don't want JACK, they just want to leverage JACK's
concept of a callback-driven audio API. So your whole point of
pulseaudio/jack integration is completely invalid.


They need some abstraction layer to route chrome-internal audio streams
to different devices. They can do this with pulseaudio, but maybe they
want something more lightweight, e.g., something with a chrome-internal
HTML5 frontend.


Those of us who understand the technical details might contribute an
advice or two, but otherwise, this is none of other business.



Cheers
