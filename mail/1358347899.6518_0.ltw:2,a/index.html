&gt;&gt; Here's my response on the chromium-os-discuss list:

&gt;
&gt; Which is wrong on so many levels.
&gt;
&gt; Mostly, because the draft is about ChromeOS, not Linux in general.
&gt;

ChromeOS runs on the Linux Audio stack. Further abstraction of the linux
Audio Stack is not necessary to achieve their goals.

&gt; Second, because they don't want JACK, they just want to leverage JACK's
&gt; concept of a callback-driven audio API. So your whole point of
&gt; pulseaudio/jack integration is completely invalid.
&gt;

I can understand that they may not want to deal with maintaining ongoing
support for pulse audio due to the large amount of deps that are required
to get it to compile. However that should not stop them from using JACK.

&gt;
&gt; They need some abstraction layer to route chrome-internal audio streams
&gt; to different devices. They can do this with pulseaudio, but maybe they
&gt; want something more lightweight, e.g., something with a chrome-internal
&gt; HTML5 frontend.
&gt;

Pulseaudio can be controlled with an html5 frontend. If that;s all they
want then why do they need to reinvent the Audio stack to achieve it?

&gt;
&gt; Those of us who understand the technical details might contribute an
&gt; advice or two, but otherwise, this is none of other business.
&gt;

Are you patronising me or just being rude?
