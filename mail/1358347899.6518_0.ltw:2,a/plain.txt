ChromeOS runs on the Linux Audio stack. Further abstraction of the linux
Audio Stack is not necessary to achieve their goals.

I can understand that they may not want to deal with maintaining ongoing
support for pulse audio due to the large amount of deps that are required
to get it to compile. However that should not stop them from using JACK.

Pulseaudio can be controlled with an html5 frontend. If that;s all they
want then why do they need to reinvent the Audio stack to achieve it?
