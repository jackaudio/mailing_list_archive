&gt;&gt; This is the process for enabling jack and pulse on Debian systems.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1: Add the user to the audio group
&gt;
&gt; On Debian, the user is already a member of the audio group, but not on
&gt; Ubuntu.
&gt;

I recall that on a clean install of Debian Wheezy 64 bit that I had to add
the user to the audio group.
 It might be me but I only had to do it a couple of months back so its all
still pretty fresh.

&gt;&gt; 2: logout of the desktop to apply the changes to the user priviledges
&gt;&gt; 3: install "pulseaudio-module-jack"
&gt;&gt; 4: disable autospawn by manually editing the ~/pulse/client.conf file
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     autospawn = no
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 5: restart pulseaudio
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     pulseaudio -k
&gt;&gt;     pulseaudio -D
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If this is required for you to get jackdbus grab the card from pulseaudio
&gt; (by killing pulseaudio before starting jack), then you'd have to do the
&gt; same on any system with the same version of pulseaudio and jack. The
&gt; reason to that is what you explain at 7:, namely, pulseaudio suffering
&gt;  from a bug making it not release the card at certain circumstances.
&gt;

Not necessarily. it only kicks in if you originally start PA with
autospawn enabled.

&gt;&gt; 6: start jack
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 7: It may also be necessary to restart the computer after all these
&gt;&gt; changes to make sure pulse releases the device to jack. Especially if
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; user as already being playing audio through pulse. This is a known bug
&gt;&gt; with pulse and dbus not releasing the device properly.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For the average user this is a relatively routine procedure but for the
&gt;&gt; n00b user these steps are daunting and challenging requiring a large
&gt;&gt; amount of background knowledge and definitely a frustrating user
&gt;&gt; experience.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; With Fedora I did not have to do any of that to get jack to work for me.
&gt;&gt; However I am not sure what has happened with f17/18.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What version of pulseaudio and jack? Which Fedora release? How is
&gt; pulseaudio and jack configured differently on Fedora?
&gt;

I don't know how PA is configured differently on Fedora but I didn't have
the same problems using it with that OS.

&gt; So far, I'm not seeing any distro specific problem. Only buggy code. And
&gt;  from what I've read, there may be more than one bug causing problems in
&gt; pulse and jack integration.
&gt;

The other thing that causes severe headaches is the naming of the jack1/2 
packages on Debian.
