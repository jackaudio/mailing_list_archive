If you can't recieve constructive feedback that is not going to help
anything.

I posted this thread to LAU in October last year.

As it currently stands pulse audio does not play nicely with jack ootb on
Debian Wheezy. You can dismiss it as not your problem but if the Debian
packagers are not prepared to test this stuff before creating packages and
feeding that back to the PA devs so they can fix the problem then all
Debian users who want to use JACK with PA suffer as a result.

It's really a simple test procedure and should be a part of every
packaging teams QA process.

1: start PA
2: play something (not using jack)
3: start jack
4: verify that jack starts
5: check that PA shows up as jack ports
7: play something (not using jack)
6: stop jack
7: play something (not using jack)

It should take less than 30 seconds to run this procedure and assuring
that it works will save countless people a lot of time and frustration.
