Thanks for the suggestion but I have to rethink how to accomplish this.

Let me describe my set-up and what I have tried till now.
I'm using Archlinux with pure systemd.
I wrote my custom jack.service and jackd is started at system boot:

My jack.service (also discussed here a couple weeks ago):
[Unit]
Description=JACK
After=sound.target

[Service]
User=stefan
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackd -P 85 -d alsa -P hw:2,0 -r 96000 -n 3 -p 256
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
LimitRTPRIO=infinity

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

My mpd.conf is configured to use jack:
...
audio_output {
       type             "jack"
       name             "JACK Audiolab MDAC"
       device           "hw:2,0"
       format           "*:24_3:2"
       mixer_type       "disabled"
}
...

This is my current set-up and I'm very happy with it :)


As you can see above mpd uses hard-coded connection to jack and
it do real connection when my mpd-client (running on another machine)
starts playing (hit "Play" button)

(1) mpd -&gt; jackd

Now, I have to include jackeq in the middle of the (1) connection. So,
I wrote another systemd service - for jackeq:
[Unit]
Description=JackEQ
Requires=jack.service
After=jack.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=stefan
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackeq -d

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Then I start jackeq.service.
To make the connections to jackeq I use:

Music Player Daemon:left -&gt; jackEQ:c.1-in-L
jackEQ:c.1-out-L -&gt; system:playback_1
Music Player Daemon:right -&gt; jackEQ:c.1-in-R
jackEQ:c.1-out-R -&gt; system:playback_2


jack_connect Music\ Player\ Daemon:left jackEQ:c.1-in-L
jack_connect Music\ Player\ Daemon:right jackEQ:c.1-in-R

jack_connect jackEQ:c.1-out-L system:playback_1
jack_connect jackEQ:c.1-out-R system:playback_2

This way I get:
(2) mpd -&gt; jackeq -&gt; jackd

and I'm able to use jackeq, but only statically.
Statically means that cannot adjust of bass and treble during playback,
but just load values (for bass and treble) from jackeq.conf file
located in my $HOME (same as Roland Mas suggests).


The main problem is that connection (1) is always created (from mpd I think)
when the playback starts from mpd-client and I have to disconnect it
every time before I make connection (2).

&gt;&gt; Hello
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My music server is headless (no graphical environment).
&gt;&gt; I'm using mpd + JACK to play music.
&gt;&gt; Now I need some software equalizer (JACK based of course), but running
&gt;&gt; in daemon mode.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; JackEQ is the application I currently installed. It could be run in
&gt;&gt; daemon mode like that:
&gt;&gt; $ jackeq -d
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But I don't understand how to use it further more:
&gt;&gt; - how to connect it (to mpd in my case) ?
&gt;
&gt; IIRC ,you can connect the channels via jack_connect
&gt;
&gt;&gt; - how to adjust bass and treble ?
&gt;
&gt; To the best of my knowledge you are the first person who has publicly
&gt; expressed an interest in having this functionality. Hence it doesn't exist
&gt; yet :-)
&gt;
&gt; I'm happy to spend some time on it if you have some ideas for how to
&gt; achieve it for your use case.
