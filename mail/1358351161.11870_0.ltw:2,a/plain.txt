What kicks in? The only reason why jackdbus is not grabbing the card  
sometimes, is because of a bug in pulseaudio. Has nothing to do with  
packaging, or the pulse config for autospawn. If jackdbus is failing to  
grab the card, you can also use pasuspender to temporarily have PA ungrab  
the card.

I might look into that. However, the only two things I can think of what  
makes their way work (if that is actually so) is either:
1. they've pathched the pulse code and not shared upstream (which sounds  
utterly implausible)
2. They are using some kind of wrapper with jack (which then would  
circumvent the bug)

Also, you may have had more than one audio device in your system, and  
started jack with another card.

In any way, it's not a packaging problem per se. The pulseaudio bug has  
seen some attention, so it aught to get fixed in time.

I also fail to see the problem here. There are two different jacks after  
all.
