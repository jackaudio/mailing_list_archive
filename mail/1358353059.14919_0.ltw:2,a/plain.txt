Au contraire, I love constructive feedback. Where's your bug report?

Since when is LAU the canonical bug tracker for Debian? I don't even
read it.

You don't need jackdbus for interacting with pulseaudio. But let me show
you something:

adi@foh:~$ apt-file search jackdbus
jackd2: /usr/bin/jackdbus
pulseaudio-module-jack: /usr/lib/pulse-2.0/modules/module-jackdbus-detect.so


If you want to imply that it's impossible to figure out from this list
that the packages "jackd2" and "pulseaudio-module-jack" might be useful,
then I'm afraid I can't help.

So we actually have three packages:

jackd  --> dummy package that will pull in jackd2
jackd1
jackd2

And guess what: the "I don't know what I'm doing, let's install jackd"
attitude will just pull in jackd2, right the one you need.

We cannot and probably never will pull in the pulseaudio module, since
there are people who don't want pulseaudio on their systems. As simple
as that.

BTW: I just reread your LAU post:

> When I looked yesterday I had jackd and jackd2. Today I have jackd and
> jackdbus instead. No wonder people get confused

The only confusion here is that "jackd" and "jackd2" are package names,
while "jackd" and "jackdbus" are commands.

You're aware that I'm running pulseaudio on jackd for at least the last
four years? That is, exactly the use case you describe. I have a custom
pulseaudio configuration for this, and it's documented on
trac.jackaudio.org.

Are there other ways? Sure. "pasuspender -- jackd", that's what Ubuntu
does.


Anyway, since this is all about a PA bug that just got fixed upstream,
there's little use in more talking. As soon as this fix hits the
archives, the trouble will be gone. (Famous last words. ;) )
