&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The other thing that causes severe headaches is the naming of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jack1/2 packages on Debian.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I feel terribly sorry that we chose "jackd1" for jackd1 and "jackd2"
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt; jackd2.
&gt;&gt; If you can't recieve constructive feedback that is not going to help
&gt;&gt; anything.
&gt;
&gt; Au contraire, I love constructive feedback. Where's your bug report?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I posted this thread to LAU in October last year.
&gt;
&gt; Since when is LAU the canonical bug tracker for Debian? I don't even
&gt; read it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; http://lists.linuxaudio.org/pipermail/linux-audio-user/2012-October/087822.html
&gt;
&gt; You don't need jackdbus for interacting with pulseaudio. But let me show
&gt; you something:
&gt;
&gt; adi@foh:~$ apt-file search jackdbus
&gt; jackd2: /usr/bin/jackdbus
&gt; pulseaudio-module-jack:
&gt; /usr/lib/pulse-2.0/modules/module-jackdbus-detect.so
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If you want to imply that it's impossible to figure out from this list
&gt; that the packages "jackd2" and "pulseaudio-module-jack" might be useful,
&gt; then I'm afraid I can't help.
&gt;
&gt; So we actually have three packages:
&gt;
&gt; jackd  --&gt; dummy package that will pull in jackd2
&gt; jackd1
&gt; jackd2
&gt;
&gt; And guess what: the "I don't know what I'm doing, let's install jackd"
&gt; attitude will just pull in jackd2, right the one you need.
&gt;
&gt; We cannot and probably never will pull in the pulseaudio module, since
&gt; there are people who don't want pulseaudio on their systems. As simple
&gt; as that.
&gt;
&gt; BTW: I just reread your LAU post:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; When I looked yesterday I had jackd and jackd2. Today I have jackd and
&gt;&gt; jackdbus instead. No wonder people get confused
&gt;
&gt; The only confusion here is that "jackd" and "jackd2" are package names,
&gt; while "jackd" and "jackdbus" are commands.
&gt;

Not really the problem I saw was that I had different filenames for the
jack1/ jack2 commands. When I installed jack1 I had jackd and jackdbus
when I uninstalled jack1 and installed jack2 I had jackd and jackd2.

I don't know what is going on there but if it is not obvious to me then it
will surely be a mystery for a lot of n00bs.




&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1: start PA
&gt;&gt; 2: play something (not using jack)
&gt;&gt; 3: start jack
&gt;&gt; 4: verify that jack starts
&gt;&gt; 5: check that PA shows up as jack ports
&gt;&gt; 7: play something (not using jack)
&gt;&gt; 6: stop jack
&gt;&gt; 7: play something (not using jack)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You're aware that I'm running pulseaudio on jackd for at least the last
&gt; four years? That is, exactly the use case you describe. I have a custom
&gt; pulseaudio configuration for this, and it's documented on
&gt; trac.jackaudio.org.
&gt;
&gt; Are there other ways? Sure. "pasuspender -- jackd", that's what Ubuntu
&gt; does.
&gt;

I tried that command but it didn't release the device for me either.

&gt;
&gt; Anyway, since this is all about a PA bug that just got fixed upstream,
&gt; there's little use in more talking. As soon as this fix hits the
&gt; archives, the trouble will be gone. (Famous last words. ;) )
&gt;

If it was a regression then I hope that in the future it will be tested
for with every major release as now that pulseaudio and jack integration
has pretty much stabilised people are expecting the combination to "just
work" (tm) .
