Whom are you trying to fool, here?

   1. There has never been a command named jackd1.
   2. There has never been a command named jackd2.
   3. There has never been jackdbus in Debian's jackd1 package.

But feel free to prove me wrong, here's the link to all jackd packages
ever available in Debian:

   http://snapshot.debian.org/binary/jackd1/

   http://snapshot.debian.org/binary/jackd2/

Please name the version that proves your point.


Or maybe you prefer to grep through the buildlogs instead? They contain
a package list at the end:


https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=jack-audio-connection-kit&arch=i386

The word "dbus" doesn't even appear here. (j-a-c-k is jackd1). Here's
jackd2:

   https://buildd.debian.org/status/logs.php?pkg=jackd2&arch=i386


So? Which one?
