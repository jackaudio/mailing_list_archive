just an FYI, but http://trac.jackaudio.org/ is currently inaccessible and
spewing a litany of python errors.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The other thing that causes severe headaches is the naming of the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jack1/2 packages on Debian.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel terribly sorry that we chose "jackd1" for jackd1 and "jackd2"
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; jackd2.
&gt; &gt; If you can't recieve constructive feedback that is not going to help
&gt; &gt; anything.
&gt;
&gt; Au contraire, I love constructive feedback. Where's your bug report?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I posted this thread to LAU in October last year.
&gt;
&gt; Since when is LAU the canonical bug tracker for Debian? I don't even
&gt; read it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; http://lists.linuxaudio.org/pipermail/linux-audio-user/2012-October/087822.html
&gt;
&gt; You don't need jackdbus for interacting with pulseaudio. But let me show
&gt; you something:
&gt;
&gt; adi@foh:~$ apt-file search jackdbus
&gt; jackd2: /usr/bin/jackdbus
&gt; pulseaudio-module-jack:
&gt; /usr/lib/pulse-2.0/modules/module-jackdbus-detect.so
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If you want to imply that it's impossible to figure out from this list
&gt; that the packages "jackd2" and "pulseaudio-module-jack" might be useful,
&gt; then I'm afraid I can't help.
&gt;
&gt; So we actually have three packages:
&gt;
&gt; jackd  --&gt; dummy package that will pull in jackd2
&gt; jackd1
&gt; jackd2
&gt;
&gt; And guess what: the "I don't know what I'm doing, let's install jackd"
&gt; attitude will just pull in jackd2, right the one you need.
&gt;
&gt; We cannot and probably never will pull in the pulseaudio module, since
&gt; there are people who don't want pulseaudio on their systems. As simple
&gt; as that.
&gt;
&gt; BTW: I just reread your LAU post:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; When I looked yesterday I had jackd and jackd2. Today I have jackd and
&gt; &gt; jackdbus instead. No wonder people get confused
&gt;
&gt; The only confusion here is that "jackd" and "jackd2" are package names,
&gt; while "jackd" and "jackdbus" are commands.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 1: start PA
&gt; &gt; 2: play something (not using jack)
&gt; &gt; 3: start jack
&gt; &gt; 4: verify that jack starts
&gt; &gt; 5: check that PA shows up as jack ports
&gt; &gt; 7: play something (not using jack)
&gt; &gt; 6: stop jack
&gt; &gt; 7: play something (not using jack)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You're aware that I'm running pulseaudio on jackd for at least the last
&gt; four years? That is, exactly the use case you describe. I have a custom
&gt; pulseaudio configuration for this, and it's documented on
&gt; trac.jackaudio.org.
&gt;
&gt; Are there other ways? Sure. "pasuspender -- jackd", that's what Ubuntu
&gt; does.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, since this is all about a PA bug that just got fixed upstream,
&gt; there's little use in more talking. As soon as this fix hits the
&gt; archives, the trouble will be gone. (Famous last words. ;) )
