This body is what I originally emailed you before I received an email
stating I had to do a bunch of steps to even email you.Needless to say
confusing!

On a lighter note the email I sent.

 

Hello

I found you from here -

-a-bluetooth-headset-simultaneously&gt;
http://superuser.com/questions/200880/can-audio-go-to-both-the-speakers-and-
a-bluetooth-headset-simultaneously

 

I bought a sweet nokia 360 blue tooth speaker, and I would like to be able
to send music to that Bluetooth speaker, and ALSO send music to my pc
speakers. As you may be aware windows did away with this feature in windows
xp. And im on windows 7. and I cannot seem to find a simple way to send
audio to pc speakers and Bluetooth.

 

The link above claims Jack can do this. I downloaded it. But that's it..
I've had  a look around your site and im not finding info on Bluetooth, ive
also searched google jack blue tooth, jack play Bluetooth and speaker. But I
get no results.

 

Can Jack accomplish this task?

If so, how please?

And how much would this cost if this works for me?

 

Thanks.

Chris
