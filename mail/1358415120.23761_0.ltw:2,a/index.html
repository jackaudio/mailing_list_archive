JACK is an open source project. You do not have to pay any money to use it.

JACK on windows requires ASIO support from your audio playback software. 
It is intended for professional audio production not general audio
playback.



&gt; On a lighter note the email I sent.

&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; I found you from here -
&gt; &lt;http://superuser.com/questions/200880/can-audio-go-to-both-the-speakers-and
&gt; -a-bluetooth-headset-simultaneously&gt;

&gt; a-bluetooth-headset-simultaneously
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I bought a sweet nokia 360 blue tooth speaker, and I would like to be able
&gt; to send music to that Bluetooth speaker, and ALSO send music to my pc
&gt; speakers. As you may be aware windows did away with this feature in
&gt; windows
&gt; xp. And im on windows 7. and I cannot seem to find a simple way to send
&gt; audio to pc speakers and Bluetooth.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The link above claims Jack can do this. I downloaded it. But that's it..
&gt; I've had  a look around your site and im not finding info on Bluetooth,
&gt; ive
&gt; also searched google jack blue tooth, jack play Bluetooth and speaker. But
&gt; I
&gt; get no results.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can Jack accomplish this task?
&gt;
&gt; If so, how please?
&gt;
&gt; And how much would this cost if this works for me?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Chris
