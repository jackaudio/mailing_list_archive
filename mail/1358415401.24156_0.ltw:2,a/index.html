Hi Chris,

The Jack Audio Connection Kit in Windows connects ASIO or native Jack
applications to your audio hardware with either dsound or ASIO audio
drivers (usually only a single sound device).

Combining Audio devices in Jack for Windows is not supported (as far
as I know) - however, the ASIO4ALL driver (www.asio4all.com) combines
WDM drivers and wraps them in a single ASIO layer, which means that if
your 'music player' uses ASIO (not many do) then it may be possible to
route a signal into both audio devices using that driver...

I'm a Jack user, not a developer, so if the answer is that Jack for
Windows can connect to two different audio devices, then you could
perhaps use Jack for this, also so long as your 'music player' has
ASIO outputs...

The commercial Virtual Audio Cable driver
(http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm) may also do what you are
looking for (but I have not used it in years so no longer know what
its capabilities are).

Kind regards,
GrahamG

&gt; On a lighter note the email I sent.

&gt;
&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; I found you from here -
&gt; &lt;http://superuser.com/questions/200880/can-audio-go-to-both-the-speakers-and
&gt; -a-bluetooth-headset-simultaneously&gt;
&gt; http://superuser.com/questions/200880/can-audio-go-to-both-the-speakers-and-
&gt; a-bluetooth-headset-simultaneously
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I bought a sweet nokia 360 blue tooth speaker, and I would like to be able
&gt; to send music to that Bluetooth speaker, and ALSO send music to my pc
&gt; speakers. As you may be aware windows did away with this feature in windows
&gt; xp. And im on windows 7. and I cannot seem to find a simple way to send
&gt; audio to pc speakers and Bluetooth.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The link above claims Jack can do this. I downloaded it. But that's it..
&gt; I've had  a look around your site and im not finding info on Bluetooth, ive
&gt; also searched google jack blue tooth, jack play Bluetooth and speaker. But
&gt; I
&gt; get no results.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can Jack accomplish this task?
&gt;
&gt; If so, how please?
&gt;
&gt; And how much would this cost if this works for me?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Chris
