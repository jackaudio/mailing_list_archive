In-Reply-To: CW2U [Jack-Devel] WOW What a process to ask a simple question. Does your software give the ability to play music through pc speakers and a Bluetooth speaker. That's it... Simple. (1358413432.20863_0.ltw:2,a)

Hi Chris,

The Jack Audio Connection Kit in Windows connects ASIO or native Jack
applications to your audio hardware with either dsound or ASIO audio
drivers (usually only a single sound device).

Combining Audio devices in Jack for Windows is not supported (as far
as I know) - however, the ASIO4ALL driver (www.asio4all.com) combines
WDM drivers and wraps them in a single ASIO layer, which means that if
your 'music player' uses ASIO (not many do) then it may be possible to
route a signal into both audio devices using that driver...

I'm a Jack user, not a developer, so if the answer is that Jack for
Windows can connect to two different audio devices, then you could
perhaps use Jack for this, also so long as your 'music player' has
ASIO outputs...

The commercial Virtual Audio Cable driver
(http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm) may also do what you are
looking for (but I have not used it in years so no longer know what
its capabilities are).

Kind regards,
GrahamG
