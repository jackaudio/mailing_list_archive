Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Windows dev: error linking libjack64.lib

Hello,

I am trying to port an application using Jack from Linux to Windows. I
have an issue when linking with libjack64.

My development environment is Windows 7 64 bits + QtCreator (using
Visual Studio 10.0 as compiler/linker).

I installed Jack binaries for Windows and found Jack\lib\libjack64.lib
and C:\Windows libjack64.dll.
I would like to use these 2 files to link with Jack, for that I wrote
a small exemple with QtCreator.

[.pro]
This is the part about lib linking (.lib and .dll are in
jack-1.9.9/lib/, .h are in jack-1.9.9/includes) :

win32: LIBS += -L$$PWD/jack-1.9.9/lib/ -llibjack64
INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/jack-1.9.9/includes
DEPENDPATH += $$PWD/jack-1.9.9/includes

[.cpp]
#include <jack/jack.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QApplication a(argc, argv);
    QLabel versions;

    // get jack version
    versions.setText(QString("libjack v") + QString(jack_get_version_string()));

    versions.show();
    return a.exec();
}

[Build error]
Compilation is OK, but link stage fails with:
"main.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
_jack_get_version_string referenced in _main"

[Comments]
I do not understand why it is failling because I am always doing
successfully like that with other libs, I have got suppositions :
- some paths are wrong ?
- should I link statically instead of dynamically ?
- libjack64.lib was not compiled with a MSVC compiler and so I can't
link using MSVC ?
- is it a QtCreator related issue ?

If it is not possible (for some reasons) to link against
libjack64.lib, would it be a good solution to load only libjack64.dll
at runtime using LoadLibrary("libjack64.dll") ?
Another solution is to recompile Jack on Windows but I only have
Visual Studio 2012 express which seems not to be supported according
to the REAMDE in Windows source directory.

I am definitely not a Windows developer, so maybe I just do not
understand nicely how DLL linking is working.

Do you have any idea what is the best way to link libjack64 using MSVC
compiler ?

Bests,
Julien.
