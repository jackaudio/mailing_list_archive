I send once again because I forgot add our list. Sorry.

So we agree that OP can run Windows APP (not all - but it can't also run ALL Windows apps on Windows - e.g. 16bit apps on 64 OS, while on Wine it can ;-)

You can use almost all (or even all) VSTs that are compatible with Receptor by Muse. It is not enough for you ?

I don't want to talk about Reaper, can only say that I'm using it and it's possible to configure, but ..
... can talk about FSTHost - it is native Jack compatible app, that use Wine only for load VST library. All other tasks are provided by native Linux code.

There is also Wine-RT patch that map Windows priorities to Linux, and young project Wine LPA:
