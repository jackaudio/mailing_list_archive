&gt; I haven't read all of this thread, but there are a few things I want to
&gt; point out.
&gt;
&gt; 1) The audio group is not added on Ubuntu, because the "audio" group name
&gt; is already used for another incompatible feature, i e, that of being able
&gt; to exclusively access a sound card even though you are not logged in. See
&gt; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/**TheAudioGroup&lt;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/TheAudioGroup&gt;for details.
&gt;

that document includes this line:

"This can be necessary for running low-latency audio without drop-outs, but
is bad from a security and stability point of view, as a process running
with real-time privileges can lock up the entire system completely. "

this is no longer true. it is trivial to configure the amount of time that
RT-scheduled tasks can consume. it can no longer be used as an explanation
of why RT scheduling is problematic.

5) IMO, what we Linux Audio developers need is a greater unification of
&gt; what we want to accomplish and how, and more people with skill and time to
&gt; make that happen. Complaining might help to some degree - at least it's
&gt; better to complain than to just silently walk away in despair - but what we
&gt; really need is more manpower, and skilled manpower.
&gt;

amen. though we need bigger sticks, too.
