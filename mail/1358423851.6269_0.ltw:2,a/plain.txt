that document includes this line:

"This can be necessary for running low-latency audio without drop-outs, but
is bad from a security and stability point of view, as a process running
with real-time privileges can lock up the entire system completely. "

this is no longer true. it is trivial to configure the amount of time that
RT-scheduled tasks can consume. it can no longer be used as an explanation
of why RT scheduling is problematic.
