I'm not a security expert, so excuse me if these are stupid questions, 
but...

First, I tried to look this up on http://jackaudio.org/linux_rt_config 
but I saw no such documentation.

Second, your argument seems to apply to RT scheduling only - what about 
memlock?

Third, if you were a maintainer of an general purpose distro, that 
should be able to do everything from pro-audio, consumer audio, gaming, 
run on laptops with decent battery life, to multi-user ssh and web 
servers and all that, how do you recommend we set RT and memlock 
privileges for the user by default?

Finally, thanks for now recommending the "realtime" group instead of the 
"audio" group :-)
