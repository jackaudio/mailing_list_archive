&gt; hmm .. maybe I just asking the wrong questions ?

&gt; Are JackSession is obsolete or some kind of taboo ?
&gt; Or maybe Jack1 is ?

&gt; It's pretty annoying that no one can at least confirm or denied this bug.
&gt;

you need to understand more about how JACK is developed.

there are basically 2 people who will pay close attention to issues with
JACK - myself and stephane. i pay attention to jack1 issues and general
API, stephane pays attention to jack2 (and general API issues to some
extent). both stephane and i have fulltime other activities to pay
attention to. there are no other active developers at this time although
adrian knoth and nedko arnaudov have provided occasional small patches.

JackSession was implemented by torben who is still on the mailing list but
has a full time job (working on the linux kernel) and he does not tend to
be involved in JACK development at this time.

when people do not answer your question(s) it is because (a) we are all
busy with other (fulltime) things and/or (b) we feel that someone else is
better positioned to answer it (even though they may not do so).


&gt;
&gt; OFC http://trac.jackaudio.org/ is broken, so even can't report bug in
&gt; this way.
&gt;

this has been known about for a long time. the people who set up trac have
not yet fixed it. it was broken by the webhosting service.
