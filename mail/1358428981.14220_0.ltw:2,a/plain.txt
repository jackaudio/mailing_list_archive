Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows dev: error linking libjack64.lib

I made a quick test on Visual Studio 2012 Express: create a Win32
console project which only calls printf("version: %s\n",
jack_get_version_string()); I also added libjack64.lib in project
properties Linker >> Additional Dependencies.
The link error is still the same. It eliminates Qt Creator
environement from root cause of the problem.
