Thanks for clearing it, but will be much simpler if you can just add this policy to documentation (JackSession is supported only by Torben) then you both with Stephane will not be SPAM-ed by this questions.

If you are main developer of this app then you at least should know there is known bug and (what is worst) it is not compatible with own documentation (lack of one API call).

I respect your time and if Torben have no time for this , it's OK and I respect his time too. But please respect my time also , in particular that I want to help. I can try by providing patch or maybe even share maintaining JackSession with Torben (and his bless). As you know I have my own history with sustaining your work (fst case).

For now you just redirect questions to Torben who just not answering ... which actually mean my bug reports and questions are rejected. I lose my time for understand your policy, waiting for answers and can't develop further my Jack based apps.

OFC I can make patch for myself - but until you include it in official Jack release my app will be useless for regular users who don't want recompile Jack with patch, and will be not supported by any distro.

&gt; &gt; hmm .. maybe I just asking the wrong questions ?
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Are JackSession is obsolete or some kind of taboo ?
&gt; &gt;  Or maybe Jack1 is ?
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  It's pretty annoying that no one can at least confirm or denied this bug.
&gt; you need to understand more about how JACK is developed.
&gt; 
&gt; there are basically 2 people who will pay close attention to issues with JACK - myself and stephane. i pay attention to jack1 issues and general API, stephane pays attention to jack2 (and general API issues to some extent). both stephane and i have fulltime other activities to pay attention to. there are no other active developers at this time although adrian knoth and nedko arnaudov have provided occasional small patches.
&gt;  
&gt; JackSession was implemented by torben who is still on the mailing list but has a full time job (working on the linux kernel) and he does not tend to be involved in JACK development at this time. 
&gt; 
&gt; when people do not answer your question(s) it is because (a) we are all busy with other (fulltime) things and/or (b) we feel that someone else is better positioned to answer it (even though they may not do so).
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;  OFC http://trac.jackaudio.org/ is broken, so even can't report bug in this way.
&gt; this has been known about for a long time. the people who set up trac have not yet fixed it. it was broken by the webhosting service.
