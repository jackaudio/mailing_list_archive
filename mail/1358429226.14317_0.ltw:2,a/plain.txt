Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Odp: Re: Odp: Jack1 && jack_get_uuid_for_client_name

Thanks for clearing it, but will be much simpler if you can just add this policy to documentation (JackSession is supported only by Torben) then you both with Stephane will not be SPAM-ed by this questions.

If you are main developer of this app then you at least should know there is known bug and (what is worst) it is not compatible with own documentation (lack of one API call).

I respect your time and if Torben have no time for this , it's OK and I respect his time too. But please respect my time also , in particular that I want to help. I can try by providing patch or maybe even share maintaining JackSession with Torben (and his bless). As you know I have my own history with sustaining your work (fst case).

For now you just redirect questions to Torben who just not answering ... which actually mean my bug reports and questions are rejected. I lose my time for understand your policy, waiting for answers and can't develop further my Jack based apps.

OFC I can make patch for myself - but until you include it in official Jack release my app will be useless for regular users who don't want recompile Jack with patch, and will be not supported by any distro.
