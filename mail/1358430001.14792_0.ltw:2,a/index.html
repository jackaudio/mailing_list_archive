&gt; Thanks for clearing it, but will be much simpler if you can just add this
&gt; policy to documentation (JackSession is supported only by Torben) then you
&gt; both with Stephane will not be SPAM-ed by this questions.
&gt;

that isn't in the docs because it isn't true.


&gt; If you are main developer of this app then you at least should know there
&gt; is known bug and (what is worst) it is not compatible with own
&gt; documentation (lack of one API call).
&gt;

main developer of what app? jack1? sure .. do you know how many bugs there
are in ardour? how do you think i should prioritize my time?

furthermore, the API for JackSession is documented here:

    http://jackaudio.org/files/docs/html/group__SessionClientFunctions.html

you will note that it does not include jack_get_uuid_for_client_name().


&gt; I respect your time and if Torben have no time for this , it's OK and I
&gt; respect his time too. But please respect my time also , in particular that
&gt; I want to help. I can try by providing patch or maybe even share
&gt; maintaining JackSession with Torben (and his bless). As you know I have my
&gt; own history with sustaining your work (fst case).
&gt;
&gt; For now you just redirect questions to Torben who just not answering ...
&gt; which actually mean my bug reports and questions are rejected. I lose my
&gt; time for understand your policy, waiting for answers and can't develop
&gt; further my Jack based apps.
&gt;

this is open source. stuff happens when it happens. i prioritize based on a
number of factors.
