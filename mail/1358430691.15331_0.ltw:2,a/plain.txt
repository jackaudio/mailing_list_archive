I have a very, very hazy recollection of reading somewhere that for a 64-bit build, MSVC no longer prepends a leading underscore to symbol names.  But that's a _very_ hazy recollection of something that I read a long time ago so I apologise if it's duff information.

I've a feeling that Graham Goode recently built a 64-bit version of libjack using MSVC so he could check whether I'm right or not.
