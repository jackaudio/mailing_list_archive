It is documented here:
http://jackaudio.org/files/docs/html/group__JackSessionManagerAPI.html

Once again , I not trying to push on you to resolve this problem by own hands. I just expected short (almost binary) answer. If you confirm that this is bug, then I can try provide patch (or maybe someone else give helping hand).
If there is no answer then can be mean everything including "don't want such questions" or has been overlooked.

In previous message I even offer that I can try support this area in Jack1, well ?
Maybe you just give me access to repository. I can also improve Jack tools and try fix "inactive ports" issue - OFC when will be clear how this should work.

It's funny because I just need this API for improved jack_lsp which works good with Jack2 and it doesn't in Jack1.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for clearing it, but will be much simpler if you can just add this policy to documentation (JackSession is supported only by Torben) then you both with Stephane will not be SPAM-ed by this questions.
&gt; that isn't in the docs because it isn't true.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; If you are main developer of this app then you at least should know there is known bug and (what is worst) it is not compatible with own documentation (lack of one API call).
&gt; main developer of what app? jack1? sure .. do you know how many bugs there are in ardour? how do you think i should prioritize my time?
&gt;  
&gt; furthermore, the API for JackSession is documented here:
&gt; 
&gt;     http://jackaudio.org/files/docs/html/group__SessionClientFunctions.html
&gt;  
&gt; you will note that it does not include jack_get_uuid_for_client_name().
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; I respect your time and if Torben have no time for this , it's OK and I respect his time too. But please respect my time also , in particular that I want to help. I can try by providing patch or maybe even share maintaining JackSession with Torben (and his bless). As you know I have my own history with sustaining your work (fst case).
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  For now you just redirect questions to Torben who just not answering ... which actually mean my bug reports and questions are rejected. I lose my time for understand your policy, waiting for answers and can't develop further my Jack based apps.
&gt; this is open source. stuff happens when it happens. i prioritize based on a number of factors.
