Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Odp: Re: Re: Odp: Jack1 && jack_get_uuid_for_client_name

It is documented here:
http://jackaudio.org/files/docs/html/group__JackSessionManagerAPI.html

Once again , I not trying to push on you to resolve this problem by own hands. I just expected short (almost binary) answer. If you confirm that this is bug, then I can try provide patch (or maybe someone else give helping hand).
If there is no answer then can be mean everything including "don't want such questions" or has been overlooked.

In previous message I even offer that I can try support this area in Jack1, well ?
Maybe you just give me access to repository. I can also improve Jack tools and try fix "inactive ports" issue - OFC when will be clear how this should work.

It's funny because I just need this API for improved jack_lsp which works good with Jack2 and it doesn't in Jack1.

I can try by providing patch or maybe even share maintaining JackSession with Torben (and his bless). As you know I have my own history with sustaining your work (fst case).
