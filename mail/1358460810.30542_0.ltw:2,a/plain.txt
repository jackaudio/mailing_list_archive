Since both this and the FFADO website were set up at about the same time,
the problem with trac.jackaudio.org is probably the same as we had with
subversion.ffado.org: the python mysql module needs to be recompiled.  The
python error trace from trac.jackaudio.org is almost the same as we were
getting from the ffado site so there's a good chance that it has the same
root cause.  If this is indeed the problem and the mysql python source tree
remains on the host (it was in ffado's case) then the exercise should be
almost trivial.

I recall hearing that there was talk of migrating the content elsewhere at
some point, but if this is still some way off and we know who has access to
the existing host it should be possible to restore trac.jackaudio.org with a
minimum of fuss.
