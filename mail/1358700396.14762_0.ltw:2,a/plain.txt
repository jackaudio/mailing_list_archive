Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK in Chrome !!

As a follow up on the original topic the Chromium developers have already
implemented CRAS.

Their main reason is that they are seeking to minimise energy usage in the
OS and not latency or audio routing issues as described in the webpage.

Apparently even though Pulseaudio is fine for Palm's/HP's webOS it is not
good enough for ChromeOS.

I have yet to get to the bottom of how badly they have screwed up JACK
integration but it is highly likely that ChromeBooks will not be able to
integrate into a netjack system.

So, I guess we can expect a new round of pissed off audio users
complaining about the lack of JACK integration with ChromeOS in the coming
years.

Probably the easiest answer will be for them to stick within their Chrome
eco system in much the same way that Android users have to now.
