nobody in the windows world has ever even suggested writing such a thing.
technically it is relatively easy to do. MS makes it much harder than it
needs to be because of requiring driver signing. but it could be done using
a "miniport" (so i've been told).

however, it is not going to happen if it left to those of us who develop
and use Linux and OS X. it requires someone who actually knows what they
are doing to step up. it is sad that after years of JACK on Windows, nobody
has (equally sad that JACK still uses portaudio as the backend, too - but
nobody has stepped up to improve that situation either).
