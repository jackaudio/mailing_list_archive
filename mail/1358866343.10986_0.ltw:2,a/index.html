&gt; If there was the same thing , that would add a new "Playback device" in
&gt;&gt; Window's Control Panel &gt; Sound devices , it would be perfect
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some sort of a virtual soundcard = "WDM Playback device"  that could be
&gt;&gt; just a route to an ASIO output like JackRouter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then all softwares could be played to JackRouter :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; nobody in the windows world has ever even suggested writing such a thing.
&gt; technically it is relatively easy to do. MS makes it much harder than it
&gt; needs to be because of requiring driver signing. but it could be done using
&gt; a "miniport" (so i've been told).
&gt;
&gt; however, it is not going to happen if it left to those of us who develop
&gt; and use Linux and OS X. it requires someone who actually knows what they
&gt; are doing to step up. it is sad that after years of JACK on Windows, nobody
&gt; has (equally sad that JACK still uses portaudio as the backend, too - but
&gt; nobody has stepped up to improve that situation either)
&gt;

So sad that I wouln't be able to code such a "virtual souncard driver"
(that would add a Playback Device in Windows' control panel) that is
connected to JACK...

This would be an amazing feature for JACK! With this feature, JACK for
Windows would be very powerful, and even more powerful than "Virtual Audio
Cable".

Does anyone have the skills in programming to do that ? I can help, but I
won't be able to do it alone!
