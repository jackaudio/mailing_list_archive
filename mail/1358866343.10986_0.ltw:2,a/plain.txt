So sad that I wouln't be able to code such a "virtual souncard driver"
(that would add a Playback Device in Windows' control panel) that is
connected to JACK...

This would be an amazing feature for JACK! With this feature, JACK for
Windows would be very powerful, and even more powerful than "Virtual Audio
Cable".

Does anyone have the skills in programming to do that ? I can help, but I
won't be able to do it alone!
