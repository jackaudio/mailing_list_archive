nothing in particular, its just a silly to base an audio API on another
audio API with quite similar properties. if we used portaudio on linux +
osx, then the argument might be stronger, but on those platforms we have
dedicated code designed to interact with the native audio API on each. it
is only on windows where we fall back on portaudio, for no reason other
than lack of human resources to do dedicated backends for WDM, DirectSound,
etc.
