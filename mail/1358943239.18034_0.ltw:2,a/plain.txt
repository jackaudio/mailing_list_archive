Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack for Windows

Hi everybody,

Who is willing to code with me, a "virtual soundcard driver" (that will add
a playback device in the list of Control Panel's playback devices), whose
job is just to route the audio to JACK ?

We really need this for JACK for Windows : to be able to play all softwares
into JACK.

Who wants to do it together ? ;)

See you! jebb
