Try typing the following line into Google:-

+"virtual sound card" +"Windows" +"open source"

There seem to be plenty of people already providing virtual sound cards that wrap the real audio I/O ports.  If Jack could recognise any of them, that would be a start.  But I guess you'd also need some means of routing outputs to inputs.

Which begs the question...  why not just get some phono leads and plug your sound card outputs back into its inputs?  You could then play back from any audio app (even one that doesn't support Jack) and record the output into some Jack-aware app.  That's what I do when I want to record the output of (say) Windows Media Player into Mixbus.

I guess it would be more convenient though if I could do it without needing to tie up real, physical outputs and inputs.
