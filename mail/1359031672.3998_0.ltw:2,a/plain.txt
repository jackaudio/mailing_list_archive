Hi John and everybody,

Try typing the following line into Google:-

Thanks for the tip. I have looked, found several things, but I haven't
really a WDM playback device that would output the sound to some ASIO
driver.
Have you found any?

I only use ASIO4ALL and JACK when I'm with my laptop , integrated soundcard
, with NO Line in ;)
So I cannot plug like this.

[ When I use my real external soundcard (MOTU), I don't need ASIO4ALL nor
JACK ]


Is there anybody interested in coding a WDM playback device, so that all
softwares can be routed to JACK for Windows ? :D

Best regards,
Jebb
