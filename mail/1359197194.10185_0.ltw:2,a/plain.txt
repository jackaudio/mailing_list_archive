HI Ralf!

Linux supports more hardware than any BSD. Linux has more users, devs and
apps (although I realise BSD can supposedly run most Linux binaries or you
can compile from source). Linux has more and better filesystems than *BSD,
JACK etc was written for Linux...

So why are you bothering running Linux audio apps under BSD? Sheer
curiosity? Seems like a waste of time from my perspective although it'd be
nice if you found something good about BSD that it does better Linux.
