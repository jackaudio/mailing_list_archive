If the driver behaves in a sane way it will default to using the card clock
as master unless you set it to something else.

The ADA8000 will probably sound better running on it's own clock, as it will
have very basic sync circuitry (no VCXO, no JetPLL). I would run the ADA8000
as master and the RME card as slave, if the Free BSD control software for the
RME card allows that (if not, you're stuck with the card as master so you'll
need to slave the converters to the card).
