Dear jack developers,
&#xA0;
I have a UG802 mini computer which  has a Rockchip 3066 1.2 GHz dual processor. Some people managed to put  together a basic Ubuntu 12.10 based Linux called Picuntu for it which generally runs very nicely.
&#xA0;
My plan is to use the device as a super portable guitar fx box with SuperCollider. But I've run into problems trying to get jack to run.
&#xA0;
First I tried the precompiled  versions of jackd 1 and 2 from the Debian(?) repositories, but both would crash when trying to use them  with a USB audio interface with jackd1 completely freezing my system. As  suggested by Robin Gareus I compiled the latest version 1.9.10 from the  git source with alsa support enabled but when I start jack with
&#xA0;
jackd -S -d alsa -d hw:H2 -r 44100 -n 3
&#xA0;
my system locks up again after these unsuspicious messages:
&#xA0;
creating alsa driver &#x2026;
configuring for 44100 Hz, period = 1024 frames (23.2 ms), buffer = 3 periods
Alsa: final selected sample format for capture: 16 bit little-endian
Alsa: use 3 periods for capture
Alsa: final selected sample format for playback: 16bit little-endian
Alsa: use 3 periods for playback
&#xA0;
Jack seems to work when I start it with the computer's built in hdmi interface:
jackd -S -d alsa -d hw:0,0 -p 512
&#xA0;
I can't really test sound output though because I don't have a hdmi tv.
&#xA0;
I tried with two interfaces: a Zoom H2 and an Alesis io2 both of which work fine when I just use Alsa to output sound.
&#xA0;
Do you have any suggestions? Btw. I haven't installed a window manager. Everything is run from the command line.
&#xA0;
thanks in advance,
Axel
&#xA0;
PS: this is my second attempt at posting this. In the first one I had attached my syslog file which to me looks a bit scrambled so I didn't really know how to extract the relevant parts. I can send it to you off list.
