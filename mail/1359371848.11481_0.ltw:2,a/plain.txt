Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] problems with system freezes when trying ot start jackd

FWIW we've recently been talking to Stephane about the growing number of customers complaining about issues with USB and Firewire audio devices.  At first we thought it might be something to do with Portaudio (Jack uses Portaudio on the Windows platform) but later, I realised that we get just as many complaints from OS-X users, where Jack doesn't use Portaudio AFAIK.  Admittedly, nobody's reported crashes but some common complaints include:-

1)  Jack not being able to start
2)  Jack not recognising the USB / Firewire device
3)  Exceptionally poor performance (e.g. audible glitching, even with very modest sessions).

Axel, it sounds like your problem might be something very specific but more generally, I suspect that Jack has some pretty serious problems with USB and Firewire modules.  If there are other people here using USB or Firewire I/O modules, some more information would probably help - e.g. which combinations of hardware & software seem to be okay and which combinations seem to be troublesome?  From our experiences with Mixbus, it seems like Presonus devices give us the most problems on Windows and Focusrite are the most troublesome on OS-X.

As suggested by Robin Gareus I compiled the latest version 1.9.10 from the git source with alsa support enabled but when I start jack with
