I have a Mackie Onyx 820i into a TI-chipset ExpressCard FireWire adapter
in an Ivy Bridge laptop.  It's been working fairly well but I have had
some hiccups: 

 * I have had times when there was severe distortion on input and output
signals.  When this happened, restarting Jack would fix it.  I haven't
seen this problem since about November (I run an up-to-date Debian
unstable; not sure what Jack and FFADO that corresponds to).

 * I had lockups with 3.2 kernels which I think are attributable to this
bug in the Intel video drivers for Ivy Bridge:   

        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=689268
        
I haven't seen this since I switched to 3.7 kernels (the bug report
indicates that a workaround was put into the kernel in the 3.5 series)

 * At times, the FFADO device doesn't want to come up.  This seems to be
related to some more widespread problem with hotplugging ExpressCard
devices:

        https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/999462

 * There have been a few times when I heard inexplicable "popcorn" on
input signals, but every time there was a LADSPA plugin between me and
the audio in so I blame the plugin until I have more info. 

Thanks,
Bill Gribble

&gt; FWIW we've recently been talking to Stephane about the growing number
&gt; of customers complaining about issues with USB and Firewire audio
&gt; devices.  At first we thought it might be something to do with
&gt; Portaudio (Jack uses Portaudio on the Windows platform) but later, I
&gt; realised that we get just as many complaints from OS-X users, where
&gt; Jack doesn't use Portaudio AFAIK.  Admittedly, nobody's reported
&gt; crashes but some common complaints include:-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Jack not being able to start
&gt; 2)  Jack not recognising the USB / Firewire device
&gt; 3)  Exceptionally poor performance (e.g. audible glitching, even with
&gt; very modest sessions).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Axel, it sounds like your problem might be something very specific but
&gt; more generally, I suspect that Jack has some pretty serious problems
&gt; with USB and Firewire modules.  If there are other people here using
&gt; USB or Firewire I/O modules, some more information would probably help
&gt; - e.g. which combinations of hardware &amp; software seem to be okay and
&gt; which combinations seem to be troublesome?  From our experiences with
&gt; Mixbus, it seems like Presonus devices give us the most problems on
&gt; Windows and Focusrite are the most troublesome on OS-X.

&gt; &gt; Dear jack developers,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a UG802 mini computer which has a Rockchip 3066 1.2 GHz dual
&gt; &gt; processor. Some people managed to put together a basic Ubuntu 12.10
&gt; &gt; based Linux called Picuntu for it which generally runs very nicely.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My plan is to use the device as a super portable guitar fx box with
&gt; &gt; SuperCollider. But I've run into problems trying to get jack to run.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First I tried the precompiled versions of jackd 1 and 2 from the
&gt; &gt; Debian(?) repositories, but both would crash when trying to use them
&gt; &gt; with a USB audio interface with jackd1 completely freezing my
&gt; &gt; system. As suggested by Robin Gareus I compiled the latest version
&gt; &gt; 1.9.10 from the git source with alsa support enabled but when I
&gt; &gt; start jack with
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; jackd -S -d alsa -d hw:H2 -r 44100 -n 3
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; my system locks up again after these unsuspicious messages:
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; creating alsa driver &#x2026;
&gt; &gt; configuring for 44100 Hz, period = 1024 frames (23.2 ms), buffer = 3
&gt; &gt; periods
&gt; &gt; Alsa: final selected sample format for capture: 16 bit little-endian
&gt; &gt; Alsa: use 3 periods for capture
&gt; &gt; Alsa: final selected sample format for playback: 16bit little-endian
&gt; &gt; Alsa: use 3 periods for playback
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jack seems to work when I start it with the computer's built in hdmi
&gt; &gt; interface:
&gt; &gt; jackd -S -d alsa -d hw:0,0 -p 512
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can't really test sound output though because I don't have a hdmi
&gt; &gt; tv.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I tried with two interfaces: a Zoom H2 and an Alesis io2 both of
&gt; &gt; which work fine when I just use Alsa to output sound.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you have any suggestions? Btw. I haven't installed a window
&gt; &gt; manager. Everything is run from the command line.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt; Axel
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; PS: this is my second attempt at posting this. In the first one I
&gt; &gt; had attached my syslog file which to me looks a bit scrambled so I
&gt; &gt; didn't really know how to extract the relevant parts. I can send it
&gt; &gt; to you off list.
