Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] problems with system freezes when trying ot start jackd

I have a Mackie Onyx 820i into a TI-chipset ExpressCard FireWire adapter
in an Ivy Bridge laptop.  It's been working fairly well but I have had
some hiccups: 

 * I have had times when there was severe distortion on input and output
signals.  When this happened, restarting Jack would fix it.  I haven't
seen this problem since about November (I run an up-to-date Debian
unstable; not sure what Jack and FFADO that corresponds to).

 * I had lockups with 3.2 kernels which I think are attributable to this
bug in the Intel video drivers for Ivy Bridge:   

        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=689268
        
I haven't seen this since I switched to 3.7 kernels (the bug report
indicates that a workaround was put into the kernel in the 3.5 series)

 * At times, the FFADO device doesn't want to come up.  This seems to be
related to some more widespread problem with hotplugging ExpressCard
devices:

        https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/999462

 * There have been a few times when I heard inexplicable "popcorn" on
input signals, but every time there was a LADSPA plugin between me and
the audio in so I blame the plugin until I have more info. 

Thanks,
