Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Odp: Re: Odp: Re: Re: Odp: Jack1 && jack_get_uuid_for_client_name

Patch is for Jack1 only (beacuse Jack2 support this API call for long time - which I say on start of this thread).

However, you can update this two "jack tools", but should wait for Paul "inactive ports" fix first, because I'm not sure how he fix this. There is at least two way for this (but i prefer this which is in Jack2 i.e. that jack_get_ports just doesn't return inactive ports).

I can try by providing patch or maybe even share maintaining JackSession with Torben (and his bless). As you know I have my own history with sustaining your work (fst case).
