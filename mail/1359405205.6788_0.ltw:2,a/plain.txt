Hi Stephane - I'll liaise with Ben to see if we can get you some proper feedback about this.  I believe that the OS-X issues have been ongoing for a very long time (even before the Windows version was ever released) so I'm surprised that you haven't been made aware of the problem.

Would it help if you could have some hardware I/O modules on a loan basis?  I don't know if Harrison could arrange it.  Or do you already have some USB / Firewire modules?
