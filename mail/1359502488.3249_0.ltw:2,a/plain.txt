Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] problems with system freezes when trying ot start jackd

 Okay, the problem turned out to be with my usb hub (powered logitech, which has never before caused me trouble).

I will research that problem a bit more later, but for now I can report that jackd2 1.9.10 is running with an usb audio interface on my UG802.

I will put my other problems with it in another topic.

Cheers,
Axel
