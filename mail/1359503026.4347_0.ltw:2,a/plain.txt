Subject:     [Jack-Devel] installed jackd in the wrong directory. What to do?

Hi list,
 
I compiled jackd 1.9.10 from source. When I did that I missed to point the build install thingy to
/usr/lib
and so it installed the jack binaries into
/usr/local/bin
 
This seems to cause a whole lot of trouble. When I start jackd and do a
jack_test
I get
exec of JACK server (command = "/usr/bin/jackd") failed: No such file or directory
jack_lsp says there's no jackd running
 
What should I do? Is it safe to just move the jack binaries to /usr/bin or will this give me more trouble?
 
I'm not an expert and I haven't found any info on this with google. Btw, it was very easy to make this mistake.
 
Thanks in advance,
Axel
