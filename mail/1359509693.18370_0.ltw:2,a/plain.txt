Subject:     [Jack-Devel] NetJack2 Issue on Windows platform (help needed)

Hi,

It's been two weeks now trying to setup netjack2 between 2 windows
platform, Windows 7 32bit and Windows XP 32bit. I'm using Jack2 version
1.9.9 on both. Jack2 alone is working fine on each version of windows
mentioned above. I can interchange audio streams between DAWs(Sonar and
Studio One) in each machine without an issue.

Problem arise when I try to stream audio between the two machines(win7 and
winxp) via NetJack2. NetJack2 is unable to transfer/stream audio to other
machine (and vice versa) even though the connections on both sides is
active with no XRUNS. I've attached screenshots in sequential order for
your reference. BTW, I'm using Presonus Studio One on each machine.

I'd like to know whether I missed some commands or I'm doing it wrong.
NetJack2 is very powerful but I just can't get it to work. Please help me.

One more thing, I'm willing to do any experiment on NetJack2 to assist its
development on Windows platform.

Thanks you so much.

More Power and Regards,
Joey
