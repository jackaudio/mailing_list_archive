Connections seems correct,

What is this "Studio One" Jack client appearing on master and slave side?

Jack2 alone is working fine on each version of windows mentioned above. I can interchange audio streams between DAWs(Sonar and Studio One) in each machine without an issue.

NetJack2 is unable to transfer/stream audio to other machine (and vice versa) even though the connections on both sides is active with no XRUNS. I've attached screenshots in sequential order for your reference. BTW, I'm using Presonus Studio One on each machine.
