I don't see anything really wrong in your setup...

Have you tried with an even simples case, like just having :

- master + one audio application, sending to slave

- on slave side: connect system:capture to system:playback (audio "thru", so that signal go back to master)

- on master get the signal from the slave and connect them to system:playback
