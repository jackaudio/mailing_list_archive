Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JackRouter ASIO driver not available for 64-bit applications

Hi everyone,

I am almost sitting next to Markus working on the same topic.

The installed version is 1.9.9_64 - at least that is what the installer file says. OS Version is Win7/64 by the way.

Having a look at the registry the "JackRouter" is only found within the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Wow6432node/ASIO which obviously makes the driver invisible for 64bit application - just my guess. 

64bit built jack client applications work fine, it is just the "JackRouter" issue.

Best Regards, Mario
