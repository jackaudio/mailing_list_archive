Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JackRouter ASIO driver not available for 64-bit applications

This is what we had to do for 1.9.8 64-bit installations:

--------------------

The Jack v 1.9.8/64bits/JackRouter.dll still has to be registered
"manually" with regsvr32 - so please try the following command to
register the 64-bit JackRouter

regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll"

Be sure to unregister previous versions before installing the new one.

Troubleshooting Tip. If you are unable to register the 64-bit
JackRouter, while in Windows Explorer navigate to \windows\system32,
and right click on "cmd.exe" and chose "Run As Administrator" from the
context menu. The open a command prompt, navigated to \Program Files
(x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits, and then enter regsvr32 JackRouter.dll at
the prompt.

------------------

Does that help?

Kind regards,
GrahamG
