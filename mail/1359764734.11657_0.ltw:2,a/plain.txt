Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: JackRouter ASIO driver not available for 64-bit applications

I probably don't have issues on my win7 64bit OS because I registered 
once back then (1.9.8) and all subsequent versions work OK here.

I didn't unregister any.... as it says on wiki, just unistall previous version before installing the new one. Is this wrong?

As
 I don't get errors or malfunctions on any app connected (mostly 
software instruments), unless one of them does the "bad" thing, like my 
Independence 3.1pro, which asks much CPU and Jack reporting software 
error and subsequent  "paranormal" behaviour from it LOL

Also , 
so far, for those on windows who are using Jack to add reverb and 
effects, the best standalone effector is GuitarRig5 x64. It works with 
jack like a dream, never had the tiniest issue. Others from time to time
 do strange stuff, (Jack reporting that client will start behaving 
abnormally) but
 probably this has to do with Savihost x64 used to make standard VST to a
 standalone unit and nothing to do with Jack...
Or this is because I didn't de-register previous Jack dll ?

Best
Panos

Ok, can we have the registering information put on the
http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows wiki page then?

Thanks!
