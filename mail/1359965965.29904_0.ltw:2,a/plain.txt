Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JackRouter ASIO driver not available for 64-bit applications

Good morning everyone,

I just tried to manually register the 64bit server - and well, yes - that`s the one. Now it appears on the Software/ASIO key as well and is found by our 64bit application.

Shouldn`t that register thing being done within the installer ? 

There is just another small one I came across in the setup dialog from JackControl on Win7. 

Is there any way to show the real buffer capabilities of the selected ASIO device in the "frames/period combo box" instead of the common 16 to 4096 list ? ASIO devices have different values for min, max and preferred size. There are even some devices that are far from the power of 2 granularity - e.g. Terratec PHASE24X that supports same latency at every possible sample rate which leads to some kind of odd buffer sizes.

Anyway, thanks for your support !

Kind regards, Mario

This is what we had to do for 1.9.8 64-bit installations:

--------------------

The Jack v 1.9.8/64bits/JackRouter.dll still has to be registered "manually" with regsvr32 - so please try the following command to register the 64-bit JackRouter

regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll"

Be sure to unregister previous versions before installing the new one.

Troubleshooting Tip. If you are unable to register the 64-bit JackRouter, while in Windows Explorer navigate to \windows\system32, and right click on "cmd.exe" and chose "Run As Administrator" from the context menu. The open a command prompt, navigated to \Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits, and then enter regsvr32 JackRouter.dll at the prompt.

------------------

Does that help?

Kind regards,
GrahamG
