Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JackRouter ASIO driver not available for 64-bit applications

Hi Mario,

From what I can recall from the last time this was discusses, the
installer is 32-bit installer and so cannot register 64-bit dlls as
that requires a 64-bit process (which then would not be able to
register the 32-bit dll).

Connecting to JackRouter will cause your ASIO connection to use the
frames/buffers that you have configured JackPortAudio to use. With
1.9.9 we can use Jack Control to start the Jack Audio server from the
GUI and so we no longer have to use the JackPortAudio shortcut to
configure options - perhaps all the ASIO capabilities will be reported
in that interface?

Kind regards,
GrahamG
