Sure : the JackRouter is actually an ASIO API /JACK API  bridge. From the point of view of the application, it "converts" calls to the ASIO API into equivalent calls to the JACK API. So a JACK client will be created in this JackRouter bridge to interact with the JACK server.  Directly using the JACK API gives a bit more control and possibly even access to some parts of the API  (like the transport API), that do not have direct equivalent in the ASIO API.  But it requires a bit more work...

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; First of all thanks a lot for the great support. Unfortunately we've got another question for you:
&gt; 
&gt; In the end, are there any differences between the JackRouter ASIO driver (e.g. used by commercial apps) and the Jack API (including the provided libs), which you can use in your own developed app? For the Jack Server they seem to be just the same kind of client...
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Markus

&gt; 
&gt; Good morning everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I just tried to manually register the 64bit server - and well, yes - that`s the one. Now it appears on the Software/ASIO key as well and is found by our 64bit application.
&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn`t that register thing being done within the installer ? 
&gt; 
&gt; There is just another small one I came across in the setup dialog from JackControl on Win7. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any way to show the real buffer capabilities of the selected ASIO device in the "frames/period combo box" instead of the common 16 to 4096 list ? ASIO devices have different values for min, max and preferred size. There are even some devices that are far from the power of 2 granularity - e.g. Terratec PHASE24X that supports same latency at every possible sample rate which leads to some kind of odd buffer sizes.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, thanks for your support !
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards, Mario
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; This is what we had to do for 1.9.8 64-bit installations:
&gt; 
&gt; --------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The Jack v 1.9.8/64bits/JackRouter.dll still has to be registered "manually" with regsvr32 - so please try the following command to register the 64-bit JackRouter
&gt; 
&gt; regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits\JackRouter.dll"
&gt; 
&gt; Be sure to unregister previous versions before installing the new one.
&gt; 
&gt; Troubleshooting Tip. If you are unable to register the 64-bit JackRouter, while in Windows Explorer navigate to \windows\system32, and right click on "cmd.exe" and chose "Run As Administrator" from the context menu. The open a command prompt, navigated to \Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits, and then enter regsvr32 JackRouter.dll at the prompt.
&gt; 
&gt; ------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Does that help?
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; GrahamG

&gt;&gt; Stephane, do we still need to register the 64-bit Jack Router? I don't 
&gt;&gt; see that information on the Wiki page anymore so I assumed not...?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; What version of Jack for Windows have you installed?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi there,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Although we're using JACK's latest mixed 64/32 bit version JACK 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accepts 64-bit applications as clients, but we are not able to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; access the JackRouter ASIO driver with 64-bit applications. Do you 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have any information for us that could help us?
