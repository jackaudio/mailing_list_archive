Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JackRouter ASIO driver not available for 64-bit applications

Sure : the JackRouter is actually an ASIO API /JACK API  bridge. From the point of view of the application, it "converts" calls to the ASIO API into equivalent calls to the JACK API. So a JACK client will be created in this JackRouter bridge to interact with the JACK server.  Directly using the JACK API gives a bit more control and possibly even access to some parts of the API  (like the transport API), that do not have direct equivalent in the ASIO API.  But it requires a bit more work...

ASIO devices have different values for min, max and preferred size. There are even some devices that are far from the power of 2 granularity - e.g. Terratec PHASE24X that supports same latency at every possible sample rate which leads to some kind of odd buffer sizes.

If you are unable to register the 64-bit JackRouter, while in Windows Explorer navigate to \windows\system32, and right click on "cmd.exe" and chose "Run As Administrator" from the context menu. The open a command prompt, navigated to \Program Files (x86)\Jack v1.9.8\64bits, and then enter regsvr32 JackRouter.dll at the prompt.
