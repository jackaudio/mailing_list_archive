Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] NetJack2 Issue on Windows platform (help needed) - SOLVED

Hi Everybody,

I'm very much happy to report that this issue is solved.

After Stéphane confirmed that there's nothing wrong with the logs i'd sent
to him via email, I focus my attention to my network config. I found out
that the MTU of my network is 1472 max, not 1500. NETJACK by default is set
to 1500 MTU. This is the reason why i got no audio even though NETJACK2
established its connection correctly as Stéphane confirms it. What i've done
to address this was to enabled Jumbo Frames on both of my NIC. And that's
it, audio is now streaming thru netjack2. This is an all Windows platform,
Windows 7 and Windows XP.....

I'd like to thank the people and this community, even though i'm not a LINUX
user, you still helped me. A BIG THANKS TO ALL OF YOU.... 

MORE POWER TO YOU GUYS.......

JOEY
