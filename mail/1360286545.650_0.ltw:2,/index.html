I need to send 8 channels of audio, 4 stereo and 2 mono, across our
network. From one side of the building to the other. This will be up 24/7.

I've been trying to figure this out for about 8 hours straight last night
and 2 hours tonight..

I currently have two machines setup on my desk. Each has one sound card
currently. Both are windows 7 x64 machines.

My goal was to setup one link to do this all. Or atleast one master and
several slaves.

I can listen to the audio and reroute it on each machine locally but not
over the network. No firewalls are enabled. I can also see on the server
machine the slave connecting in the status window.

My understanding is Audio Source -&gt; Slave Machine -&gt; Network -&gt; Master
Machine -&gt; Audio Goal

So I guess I have two questions...

Can I do 8 channels of audio over one set of machines and achieve latency
under 100ms?

Also for those of you who are still struggling with just getting the thing
working.

Couple of things, I've not seen written anywhere, Maybe I've missed it?

Start server first then slave.
The Jumbo frames need to be on for both, stated earlier in this email list.
The connection appears to be need to made in both jacks on both machines.
That was the last piece of the puzzle for me to get audio atleast working.

Thanks!

Alex

&gt; Hi Everybody,
&gt;
&gt; I'm very much happy to report that this issue is solved.
&gt;
&gt; After St&#xE9;phane confirmed that there's nothing wrong with the logs i'd sent
&gt; to him via email, I focus my attention to my network config. I found out
&gt; that the MTU of my network is 1472 max, not 1500. NETJACK by default is set
&gt; to 1500 MTU. This is the reason why i got no audio even though NETJACK2
&gt; established its connection correctly as St&#xE9;phane confirms it. What i've
&gt; done
&gt; to address this was to enabled Jumbo Frames on both of my NIC. And that's
&gt; it, audio is now streaming thru netjack2. This is an all Windows platform,
&gt; Windows 7 and Windows XP.....
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to thank the people and this community, even though i'm not a
&gt; LINUX
&gt; user, you still helped me. A BIG THANKS TO ALL OF YOU....
&gt;
&gt; MORE POWER TO YOU GUYS.......
&gt;
&gt; JOEY
