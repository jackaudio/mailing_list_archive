&gt; Hello! I used the JACK program for windows 7 but now it has pervaded my software such as Pro tools. It is causing errors. 
&gt; I attempted to uninstall it but PT still recognizes it. Can you please make an application to REMOVE it completely? 
&gt; 

As someone who develops products that use Jack, I use the uninstaller on a regular basis and I've never had a problem with it.  What version of Jack are you using?  And how do you know it isn't a problem with Pro Tools?  Or Windows?

The only time I've had a problem is when I installed Jack some other way (e.g. by installing a program that installed Jack).  Then I installed Jack itself.  Sometime later, I uninstalled Jack.  Then I uninstalled the original program.  In that scenario, the original program's uninstaller might not realise that Jack already got uninstalled.  It might just think that it couldn't uninstall Jack for some unknown reason and it might then leave registry keys lying around.  But AFAIK Jack's installer doesn't touch the registry at all.  If you've ever installed Jack when it was already installed, that could cause the kind of problem you're seeing.
