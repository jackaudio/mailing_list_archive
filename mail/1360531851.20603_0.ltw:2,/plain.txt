Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [PATCH 0/4] Multicast interface selection

Hi,
Here's an attempt to provide network interface selection for multicast Jack peers.
The interface is selected using option 'multicast-if' or '-f' in all jack2 network
services: netmanager, netadapter and net driver.
The rationale is simple: in multihoming environment (even a laptop with lan and wlan)
selecting proper interface or including all interfaces is sometimes a must have feature.
I've tested it in my home setup with multihomed servers, and laptop with eth and  wlan
as a leaf. 
Spent almost a week figuring out why my old jack2 server cannot peer with newly built
package until figured out a packet format change :)

Next step I'm plannig introducing protocol independent (v4/v6) sockets for posix
(JackUnixSocket) implementation on top of this changes (partially stashed).

I'd appreciate comments, if any.

Regards,
Ruslan
P.S. There's an ubuntu build if anyone's willing to test, under ppa:rufferson/snd.
