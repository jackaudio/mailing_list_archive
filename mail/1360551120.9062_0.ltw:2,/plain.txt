Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [PATCH] the -I and -O options are not coreaudio specific.

Hi,

The -I and -O options to adjust the reported latency values of the
hardware ports are documented in the "COREAUDIO BACKEND PARAMETERS"
section of the manual page, but they are not specific to coreaudio.
They thankfully also work for ALSA, and from what I can tell, for
freebob, oss and portaudio as well.  For that reason, they should also
be documented in those backend sections.  The attached patch (for jack2)
adds the documentation of those flags to the relevant sections.

Best,
--Lorenz
