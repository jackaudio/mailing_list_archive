Does anyone here have any experience of using Jack with Reaper (on Windows)?

I installed Reaper yesterday (on Windows 7 - 32 bit) and I also installed the latest version of Jack (1.9.10).  I'm using ASIO4ALL v2.10 and I've followed these instructions:-

http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows

but no matter what I do, I cannot make Reaper appear as a client in QJackCtl (or Jack Connect as it seems to be called now).  These symptoms may or may not be significant:-

1)  Reaper's setup dialog offers JackRouter as a backend option.  However, I see the JackRouter option - even if Jack isn't installed.
2)  When Jack is running I hear no output from Reaper with ANY ASIO driver (whether JackRouter or ASIO4ALL).  It makes NO DIFFERENCE what driver I selected with Jack.  Even if I started Jack with the DirectSound driver, it seems to prevent Reaper from using ASIO.
3)  According to various things I've read, I should be able to see a DLL called JackRouter.dll but there isn't one.
4)  I've tried adding some direct outs to a Reaper channel (just to see what would happen) but no matter what action I take, Reaper just reports a problem with the driver.

FWIW I have Harrison Mixbus installed on the same machine.  If I launch Mixbus it immediately appears as a client in QJackCtl.  However, Mixbus is already Jack-aware so that might be a red herring.  Any thanks gratefully received.

John
