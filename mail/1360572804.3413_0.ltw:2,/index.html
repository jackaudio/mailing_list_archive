There is a kind of hard dependency between JackRouter and the version of JACK (still not clear for me the exact reason). So I need to regularly recompile/relink JackRouter with a given JACK version. I think JackRouter distributed with this 1.9.10 is just broken for now.

Le 11 f&#xE9;vr. 2013 &#xE0; 09:33, John Emmas &lt;[hidden]&gt; a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Does anyone here have any experience of using Jack with Reaper (on Windows)?
&gt; 
&gt; I installed Reaper yesterday (on Windows 7 - 32 bit) and I also installed the latest version of Jack (1.9.10).  I'm using ASIO4ALL v2.10 and I've followed these instructions:-
&gt; 
&gt; http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows
&gt; 
&gt; but no matter what I do, I cannot make Reaper appear as a client in QJackCtl (or Jack Connect as it seems to be called now).  These symptoms may or may not be significant:-
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Reaper's setup dialog offers JackRouter as a backend option.  However, I see the JackRouter option - even if Jack isn't installed.
&gt; 2)  When Jack is running I hear no output from Reaper with ANY ASIO driver (whether JackRouter or ASIO4ALL).  It makes NO DIFFERENCE what driver I selected with Jack.  Even if I started Jack with the DirectSound driver, it seems to prevent Reaper from using ASIO.
&gt; 3)  According to various things I've read, I should be able to see a DLL called JackRouter.dll but there isn't one.
&gt; 4)  I've tried adding some direct outs to a Reaper channel (just to see what would happen) but no matter what action I take, Reaper just reports a problem with the driver.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW I have Harrison Mixbus installed on the same machine.  If I launch Mixbus it immediately appears as a client in QJackCtl.  However, Mixbus is already Jack-aware so that might be a red herring.  Any thanks gratefully received.
