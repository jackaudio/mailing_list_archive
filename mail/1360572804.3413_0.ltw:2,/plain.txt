Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack/JackRouter and Reaper

There is a kind of hard dependency between JackRouter and the version of JACK (still not clear for me the exact reason). So I need to regularly recompile/relink JackRouter with a given JACK version. I think JackRouter distributed with this 1.9.10 is just broken for now.
