&gt; Would it help if I uninstall v1.9.10 and go back to an earlier version?  I probably have 1.9.8 and 1.9.9 available somewhere.

&gt; Also, my 1.9.10 installation doesn't even contain a DLL called JackRouter.dll.  Does that seem correct?

Stephane - to save you having to check, I just tried both earlier versions with very mixed results.

Firstly, installing either 1.9.8 or 1.9.9 does give me the JackRouter.dll which is missing from 1.9.10.  I was also able to hear audio when JackRouter was selected as Reaper's backend.  However,

When I select 'JackRouter' (from within Reaper's setup dialog) It shows me a field saying 'Enable inputs'.  I can select 2 options, called 'first' and 'last'.

a) With Jack 1.9.8, I can see Reaper as a client (in QJackCtl) only when I change the selection called 'last'.  It doesn't matter what I change it to.

b) With Jack 1.9.9, I can only see Reaper as a client if 'last' is set to input 4.  BUT....

c) With both versions, if I select the Reaper client in QJackCtl (as if I was going to route some I/O) the client immediately disappears.

So some improvement but not much  :-(
