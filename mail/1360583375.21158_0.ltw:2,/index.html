&gt; I think there is an optioning Reaper to be sure the ASIO driver (here JackRouter) start "online" event the application is not actively playing.

I must admit, that seems very plausible Stephane - because if I start Reaper's transport playing, Reaper remains permanently visible as a client in QJackCtl.  However, as soon as I stop Reaper's transport, the Reaper client disappears from QJackCtl, every time Reaper gets deselected as the foreground window.

Having said that, I can't see anything in Reaper's settings which would change that behaviour.  If anyone knows which box to tick, please let me know.  Or maybe I'll see if there's a Reaper support forum.  I suppose there probably is.
