Hi List,

Im picking this old thread up as the issue still seems to present in jusst Git 
master.

As far I see the buildsystem is trying to link the same file twice ( once 32 
Bit, the first time and them as 64Bit binary) which fails as the source .o 
files that are beeing linked together are 32Bit compiled..

Here is a log snippet from a build with verbose mode on:

http://pastebin.com/w3dnsvFm

At the end of the Build output several warning like this are given:

 Node /root/jack2/build/common/JackError.cpp.3.o is created by more than once 
(full message on 'waf -v -v'). The task generators are:
  1. 'clientlib' in /root/jack2/common
  2. 'clientlib' in /root/jack2/common


If I can assists with further information or test builds, please let me know 
as I am currently unable to use wineasio due to missing 32Bit jack client 
library in my system..

regards,
Jan
