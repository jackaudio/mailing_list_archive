Fair enough and thank you for answering.

Now, speaking of the "process" thread, I make no doubt that the SCHED_FIFO 
policy was not chosen at random but I was wondering if they are known major 
inconveniences to reschedule it SCHED_RR.

If I may quote... Paul Davis (2001 - Linux-Audio-Dev) :
&lt;&lt; SCHED_RR is designed for situations where there are several 
 "real time" kernel threads and you wish to ensure that they all get 
 time on the processor, regardless of their own intentions. the RR 
 stands for "round robin". SCHED_FIFO is different in that once a 
 thread is running, it will run forever, or until it yields, blocks or 
 a higher priority SCHED_FIFO thread is runnable. its designed for 
 situations where there is either only 1 "real time" kernel thread, or 
 a set that are intended to do cooperative multitasking. &gt;&gt;

Now that the irqs are threaded SCHED_FIFO, aren't we in the situation where 
SCHED_RR would sound more appropriate ?
