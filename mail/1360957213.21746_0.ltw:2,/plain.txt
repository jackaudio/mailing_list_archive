not in my opinion. jack2 did this for a while.

it is helpful to think of jack (sometimes) not as an audio-related tool but
as

  "A cooperative user-space realtime scheduling system"

it is not interested in sharing cores with any/all SCHED_RR tasks, but
instead with taking very "tight" control over tasks that are a part of its
"scheduling domain". SCHED_FIFO is more appropriate for this purpose, in my
opinion.
