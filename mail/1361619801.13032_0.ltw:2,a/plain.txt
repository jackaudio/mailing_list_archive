If you want to create a time-of-day-clock you can achieve that by 
snapshotting the system time (and the Jack time) when you first run Jack 
(or when you first start your clock display).  You can snapshot the 
system time using the 'time()' function or something similar. All you 
need to do then is to work out the elapsed Jack time (by deducting the 
initial Jack time from the current Jack time).  Then just add the 
elapsed time to the system time that you obtained in the first place.  
You can then convert the result to 'time-of-day' using 'localtime()'.

It's only accurate to the nearest second but for a time-of-day clock 
that's usually all you want.  Of course, you could get better accuracy 
by dealing with remainders when you process your time calculations.
