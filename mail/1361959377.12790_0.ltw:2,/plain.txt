 I would like to use Jack in connection with PTP. PTP synchronises the
system clock, however, not the MONOTONIC Clock.

 I would like to spend sound in different computers synchronically. I am
of use PTP for the synchronisation of the computers clocks. The output
of the sound is realised by a presentation time (like AVB). I need Jack
as an interface between network datagrams and sound (input/output).

ok.
The time is adjusted continuously by PTP. Major changes take place,
however not. The computers remain in the same time zone.
