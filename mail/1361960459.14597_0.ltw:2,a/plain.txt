You do know that the sound card's clock typically is completely
independent from any other clock?  Even in the case where your sound
device is using the PTP clock?

And what particular implementation of the PTP protocol are you using?

CLOCK_MONOTONIC _is_ affected by ntp changes.  How does your PTP
implementation handle adjustments?

So you have to resample it.  Why do you want to use jack_get_time() to
control that?  Can't you query the PTP clock directly?
