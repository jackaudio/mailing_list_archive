Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Linux to Linux jacknet ?

Hi all,

I'd like to use a server PC as a MIDI synthesizer, with a client PC sending out MIDI messages, and getting back synthesized audio.

AFAIU, I can use "jackd -d net" on the server side, and "jackd opts...& jack_netsource -H <server-ip-addr>" on the client side to connect the two.

However, it doesn't seem to work. When I run jack_netsource, it says "Not connected". What may be going wrong here ? Also, on the server side, I can't connect any jack client. I guess that, until I don't have a master connected, the server-side jackd doesn't really start.

What is "jack_load netmanager" useful for, instead ?

Can anyone suggest a supposedly working set-up involving Linux on both client and server ends ? (I'm using latest jackd2 as from official Ubuntu repos).

$ jackd --help
jackdmp 1.9.9

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

  tom.
