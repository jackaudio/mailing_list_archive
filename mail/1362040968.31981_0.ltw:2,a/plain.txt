I'm sure we could argue all day about which end is the client and which
is the server, but something that works here (order may matter):

- on the laptop (elastomir), "jack_load netmanager" (it probably starts
  listening to messages or broadcasting that it is ready to do so);
- on the desktop (polymir), "jackd -d net" (actually I start it through
  Qjackctl, but whatever).

  Then the desktop gets two source channels and two sink channels which
are respectively routed from and to similar pairs of channels named
polymir:from_slave_1/2 and polymir:to_slave_1/2 on the laptop.  If I
send audio to the sinks on the desktop (for instance with PulseAudio),
then use Patchage (or qjackctl) on the laptop to patch the
polymir:from_slave_1/2 sources into the local system:playback_1/2, then
the sound goes out from the laptop's soundcard.  If I send the laptop's
PulseAudio stream to polymir:to_slave_1/2 instead, it can run through an
effects rack that runs on the desktop, then be sent back to the laptop.

  I have no idea about jack_netsource; I'd welcome more details, but the
described setup works and may be helpful :-)
