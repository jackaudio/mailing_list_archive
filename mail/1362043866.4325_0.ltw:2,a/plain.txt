Good, seems exactly what I'd need. Does it need any special way to let
the 2 machines find each other ? Like providing host names through some
command-line params ? Is jack_load netmanager needed only on one of the
two machines, and does it matter which one of the 2 ?

(I just tried to start the 2 jackd on
the same machine giving them different names -- jackd -n name -- but
it's likely that this wouldn't be the intended set-up -- I'll try
shortly with 2 machines).

On a related note, are the 2 machines constrained to be in the same
subnet ?

Thanks again,

	T.
