&gt;&gt; I'm sure we could argue all day about which end is the client and which
&gt;&gt; is the server, but something that works here (order may matter):
&gt;
&gt; :-)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; - on the laptop (elastomir), "jack_load netmanager" (it probably starts
&gt;&gt;   listening to messages or broadcasting that it is ready to do so);
&gt;&gt; - on the desktop (polymir), "jackd -d net" (actually I start it through
&gt;&gt;   Qjackctl, but whatever).
&gt;
&gt; Good, seems exactly what I'd need. Does it need any special way to let
&gt; the 2 machines find each other ? Like providing host names through some
&gt; command-line params ? 

  I didn't provide host names or anything.  The command-lines are as
quoted above&#xA0;:-) I believe the discovery happens through a Zeroconf-like
mechanism (although probably not Zeroconf itself, since avahi-discover
doesn't show anything).

&gt; Is jack_load netmanager needed only on one of the two machines, and
&gt; does it matter which one of the 2 ?

  The setup described above works with netmanager loaded only on one
computer; I didn't try running it on the other one.

&gt; (I just tried to start the 2 jackd on the same machine giving them
&gt; different names -- jackd -n name -- but it's likely that this wouldn't
&gt; be the intended set-up -- I'll try shortly with 2 machines).
&gt;
&gt; On a related note, are the 2 machines constrained to be in the same
&gt; subnet ?

  That would be a fair assumption, given the autodiscovery mentioned
above.  But maybe a setup using jack_netsource can be rid of that
constraint.

Roland.
