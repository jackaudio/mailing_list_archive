  I didn't provide host names or anything.  The command-lines are as
quoted aboveÂ :-) I believe the discovery happens through a Zeroconf-like
mechanism (although probably not Zeroconf itself, since avahi-discover
doesn't show anything).

  The setup described above works with netmanager loaded only on one
computer; I didn't try running it on the other one.

  That would be a fair assumption, given the autodiscovery mentioned
above.  But maybe a setup using jack_netsource can be rid of that
constraint.
