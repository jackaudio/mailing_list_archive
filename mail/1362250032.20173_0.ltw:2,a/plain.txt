The CoreMIDI spec seems to disallow running status.  The description
of the MIDIPacket struct:

    https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CACoreMIDIRef/MIDIServices/CompositePage.html#//apple_ref/c/tag/MIDIPacket

... and the function MIDIPacketListAdd:

    https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CACoreMIDIRef/MIDIServices/CompositePage.html#//apple_ref/c/func/MIDIPacketListAdd

... both say, "Running status is not [allowed|permitted]".  Is there a
case where running status is being used?

However, something that I didn't notice before (was it there when I
implemented the CoreMIDI driver?) is that a MIDIPacket can contain
multiple MIDI messages.  I don't remember accounting for that when I
wrote the driver.  That's a bug that will need to be fixed.
