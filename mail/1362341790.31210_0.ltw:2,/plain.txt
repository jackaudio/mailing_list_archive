Is this some Google/Andoid thing? Can you link please?

Samples are clipped when they reach the audio hardware. Between JACK
apps, samples can exceed the -1.0 1.0 range.

Just mix them. You may want to provide a master level control for
adjusting the total level. If the result must be suitable for DAC,
consider using a some dynamics effect like limiter or compressor.
