I have another couple of questions:

-) when does the master declare Xrun, when a slave is attached ?
   (I'm seeing plenty of them, but I'm temporarily reaching the slave
   through an overly complex network set-up)

-) how does the "-l" option to "jack -d net" exactly affect the behaviour ?

-) how can one use the "-m (fast|normal|slow)" options that are mentioned
   in the README_NETJACK2 file ? Does that option apply to the set-up
   I'm using ? (jackd -d net -a <master-host> + jack_load netmanager)
   Is it used on the master or slave and how does it intermix with the
   "-l X" option ?

-) let's say we have a MIDI event from the master side, triggering
   both a computation on the master jack graph, and being handed
   over to the slave for some further processing, then audio is sent
   back to the master for playback; are these audio streams mixed in
   a desynch fashion, at this point ? Is there any way to synch them ?

Thanks again,

	tom.
