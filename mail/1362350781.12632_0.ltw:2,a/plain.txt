Perhaps the numerous dropped note-on/note-off events are due to the
multiple message/packet bug, and have nothing to do with running
status.  I can't confirm the possibility either way, as I don't have
access to a Mac or an iPhone.

Excellent. :)

Awesome!  When I wrote the code, I didn't have access to a Mac, so I
couldn't debug (or even compile) what I wrote.  Just a warning, as
there could be other bugs lurking in the code.
