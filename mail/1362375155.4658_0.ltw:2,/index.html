&gt;&gt;&gt; That's interesting.  The iOS CoreMIDI spec says the same thing as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; MacOSX CoreMIDI spec.  Is that MIDI coming from the hardware driver,
&gt;&gt;&gt; or from other CoreMIDI applications?  Has a bug been filed against
&gt;&gt;&gt; either CoreMIDI or whatever is sending the MIDI messages?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It sais the same, because like many APIs in iOS, the CoreMIDI API seems to be
&gt;&gt; copied by Apple as it is. In many iOS API docs you find things like
&gt;&gt; "Availability: Available in OS X v10.5 and later" - full stop, not even
&gt;&gt; mentioning any iOS version at all.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The issue with "running status" seems to be emitted by the iOS hardware
&gt;&gt; driver. I never encountered it myself, since I don't have a keyboard or MIDI
&gt;&gt; controller which sends with running status ATM. I'm trusting here on couple
&gt;&gt; end users who reported this "running status" issue to exist on iOS. And in
&gt;&gt; fact there were some other end users who reported exactly these symptoms on
&gt;&gt; iOS (numerous dropped note on / off events). The reported keyboards (I still
&gt;&gt; find in my mails) which would have that issue were: Alesis 49, some Novation
&gt;&gt; keyboard and "maybe" Akai synth station (not sure about the latter). These
&gt;&gt; were all end user reports. Hardware defects can be exluded, since the users
&gt;&gt; reported those keyboards to work with other, more mature CoreMIDI iOS apps.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I haven't filed a bug at Apple's bug tracker system, nor checked if there is
&gt;&gt; one already. So far I haven't even proofed that this bug really exists.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the numerous dropped note-on/note-off events are due to the
&gt; multiple message/packet bug, and have nothing to do with running
&gt; status.  I can't confirm the possibility either way, as I don't have
&gt; access to a Mac or an iPhone.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I just pushed some temporary code for handling multiple events in one
&gt;&gt; MIDIPacket. Maybe St&#xE9;phane can merge it to the official git server again.
&gt;&gt; It's quite some amount of code now. It could be reduced to only few lines, by
&gt;&gt; splitting JackCoreMidiInputPort::ProcessCoreMidi() into 2 methods (one method
&gt;&gt; only iterating over events, calling each time the 2nd method which is
&gt;&gt; guaranteed to receive only data of exactly one event). However I think it's
&gt;&gt; not worth it at this point, since I expect the whole MIDI parser code in
&gt;&gt; JackCoreMidiInputPort to be dropped in favor of using
&gt;&gt; JackMidiRawInputWriteQueue very soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Excellent. :)
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you plan on adding the JackMidiRawInputWriteQueue, then I'd like to
&gt;&gt;&gt; make a suggestion.  The alsarawmidi driver and the FFADO driver use
&gt;&gt;&gt; the JackMidiRawInputWriteQueue.  If you need a reference on how to use
&gt;&gt;&gt; the driver, you can look at those drivers.  The alsarawmidi driver is
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably more relevant because it uses the two thread scheme to handle
&gt;&gt;&gt; MIDI messages, just like CoreMIDI.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Ok, I try to find a bit of time for that task in probably two weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; Awesome!  When I wrote the code, I didn't have access to a Mac, so I
&gt; couldn't debug (or even compile) what I wrote.  Just a warning, as
&gt; there could be other bugs lurking in the code.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have any other questions regarding the MIDI queue system,
&gt;&gt;&gt; please send me a message.  I'm happy to help. :)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Ok, I will get back at that. :)
&gt; 
&gt; :)
