You can possibly try to put slave in synchronous mode (-S) like:

jackd -S -d net -l XX

-l adde additionnel buffers (so adds latency) in the master/slave connection.

fast|normal|slow has been recoded as this more general "latency" (-l) parameter.

As Paul said, possibly using latency informations that is  (or should be, I will check again..) attached to netback ports.
