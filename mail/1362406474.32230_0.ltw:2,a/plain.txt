Hi Lloyd,

Some soundcards are set to a specific sample rate (like 48000 or
44100) and so you have to set that at the command line as well (to
match what the set value is).

ASIO4ALL is able to convert from one sample rate to the other, so I
think this may be your issue.

See http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jorgan/index.php?title=Instructions_on_using_the_Jack_Audio_Connection_Kit_in_Windows
for a better way of configuring things with the latest Jack for
Windows version.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
