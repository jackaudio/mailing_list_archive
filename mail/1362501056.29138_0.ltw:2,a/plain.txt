Before assuming running status is the cause, I think you should try to
find some sort of proof (not anecdotes); otherwise, you might be
writing code to solve the wrong problem.  At the least, create a
branch of JACK that calls jack_error() whenever a message is found
that doesn't start with a valid status byte, and test it on a device
with one of the known culprits.  You may find that the device driver
is packing MIDI messages that arrive in the same USB frame in the same
MIDI packet, which is a case that we *know* we weren't handling
previously.

Once again, this is based on information that you're assuming is true.
 Please make sure!

"For now" could end up lasting for a while, and you might just be
providing a workaround to a real problem that could present itself
again in the future.
