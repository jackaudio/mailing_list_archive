Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Denon ASIO and Jack

Thanks for your response Graham.
I followed the instructions on the previous link that you gave.
Unfortunately I am still unable to use the Denon ASIO driver with Jack.
My laptop: Windows 7 (32 bit ver.),i5, 4gb.
I am using the single 32 bit version of Jack (not the dual 32/64 bit version).

"ASIO::ASIO4All v2" loads fine but I do not want to use it as a driver.
Since ASIO4All works on the laptop, then this  suggests that Jack does not
'like' Denon ASIO, or a setting is not configured correctly for Denon ASIO.

My supported device listing displays my soundcard as; ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver
(a quick side question; Are the command line letters case sensitive for the
drivers? I notice some driver letters are in caps and some are in lower case).

My Jack control settings:
Sample rate is set to 44100.
Driver is Portaudio.
Realtime mode
Server prefix = Jackd
Input and output = DENON DJ ASIO Driver

When Portaudio opens, it displays: driver internals found in c\windows\system32
'can't open ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver'.

My Port audio command line (target):
"c:\program files\jack\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO
Driver" -r 44100 

Also tried with Portaudio set to run target as administrator.

None of the above settings work.
I must be missing something, but what?

Thanks again,
Lloyd
