I hope you're right.

In your place, I would create a pre-release version of JACK has:

0.) jack_error() and jack_info() logging
1.) Verbose debugging enabled
2.) A fix to the problem we know about
3.) A *loud* debug message that's emitted if running status is found

... and I would ask some of the users that complained about the
problem to test the pre-release version.

Knowing what the actual problem is may serve you well in the future.
Not knowing what the problem is may very well bite you in the ass in
ways you don't expect.
