Hi Lloyd,

The latest link that I sent you gives the steps to NOT use the command
line configuration of the Jack PortAudio shortcut but to use the GUI
configuration of Jack Control instead. Please just use Jack Control
for now, as it is a lot simpler to set different options.

Using the Jack Control Setup screen you can select your ASIO interface
by the name that Jack for Windows already recognizes it as, plus you
can experiment with Sample Rate and Buffer Size and Number of Buffers,
etc.

I did a bit of online forum reading regarding DENON devices, and there
are too many reports of ASIO issues and people complaining or stating
that the DENON ASIO drivers are faulty, with many also stating that
ASIO4ALL offers better performance and stability... just be aware of
this too.

My advice is to connect everything that you'll be wanting to use, and
then run Jack Control, run Setup and configure the options, then
attempt to start the Jack Audio server. If it fails, change
configuration options... attempt to start again.... etc.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
