Dear sir!

This is a basic sound design question and i feel you will have many more on
the path you have chosen:)

Jack doesn't care if you produce abnormal values and strange things start
to happen if you do.

Quite basically, when writing values to the jack buffer, if the value is
below -1, set it to 1, if it's above 1 set it to 1.

Everything else should be up to the user, set the default mixing volume
around 0.8.

You could also create a limiting curve to map actual values to limited
values and so emulate a limiter.

Good luck.
Slavko
