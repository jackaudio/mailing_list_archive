Lloyd,

STOP using the JackPortAudio shortcut.

ONLY use Jack Control GUI

And I just had a look at the link I sent you because I do not recal writing
anything about ALSA on a For Windows topic... And no, nothing about ALSA on
that page (
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jorgan/index.php?title=Instructions_on_using_the_Jack_Audio_Connection_Kit_in_Windows
)

??
