Try this....

Open a terminal window (i.e. a Command Prompt) and use the "cd" command 
to navigate to whichever folder contains Jack.  On a 32-bit system you'd 
normally type these two lines:-

C:
cd "\Program Files\Jack"

or, for a 64-bit system:-

C:
cd "\Program Files (x86)\Jack"

Once you're in the correct Jack folder, type this:-

jackd -d portaudio -l

(that's a letter ' l ' at the end BTW - not a number ' 1 ').  Jack 
should list some information about the various drivers it finds. For 
your Denon driver it should tell you the actual name it recognises it 
by, as well as some information about its buffer sizes and granularity.  
What information do you see for the Denon driver?

John
