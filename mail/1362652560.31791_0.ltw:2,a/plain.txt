This would render JACK unusable for professional audio. If values above
1 or below -1 occur inside a floating point DAW like Ardour it doesn't
matter much. It's up to the user to ensure that values are attenuated
before they reach the DAC. It would be unacceptable for JACK to mess around
with this stuff in the background.

Is there anything preventing you from using a lookahead limiter if values
over 0dBFS are a concern in your own work situation?
