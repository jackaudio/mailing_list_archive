Graham, regarding ALSA: 
Sorry, but please disregard the ALSA question, I read the information from a
Linux thread. My Mistake.
Per your suggestion; considering the amount of Jack control options available,
it should take quite some time to try each one to see which will work with the
Denon driver...

Hi John,
Thanks for your input.
Here is the info from my ASIO device list: 

[default ASIO input]
[default ASIO output]
Name = ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver
max Inputs = 0
max outputs = 4
ASIO min buffer size = 512
ASIO max buffer size = 512
ASIO preferred buffer size = 512
Buffer granularity = 0
Default sample rate = 0.00
end of list
cannot initialize driver
Jack server failed with -1
failed to open server

The Denon ASIO driver and the HS-5500 controller are set to 512 for buffer size.
The sample rate is 44100 for the ASIO driver and controller.

Is there any other prefix or suffix script required for Windows in the Jack
control 'server path' aside from "jackd"?

Maybe one of you developers can download the free Denon DJ ASIO Driver and see
what makes it tick:
denondjforums.com>forums>asio drivers>denon dj asio drivers (ver 101 or 102), I
am using ver 101 (32 bit). I have also tried the Denon DJ ASIO 2.22 version with
the same negative results.

Thanks for the help guys, I really appreciate it!

Lloyd O.
