Hi Lloyd

From the results of the driver list:

Buffer granularity = 0
Default sample rate = 0.00

We can theorize that this is either a PortAudio_ASIO issue or an issue
with the DENON DJ ASIO driver... the driver does not return the number
of buffers possible nor a sample rate, so doing anything at the
command line or in Jack Control will result in the same error. As
PortAudio_ASIO works with all the other ASIO devices that I have tried
it with, my vote would be that the issue is with the DENON ASIO driver
or driver settings. Does the DENON ASIO driver have its own
configuration application like the Creative Drivers had, a panel where
one could configure buffer size, sample rate, etc? Also make sure that
no other application is using the DENON DJ when attempting to
configure all of this... the ASIO driver will require exclusive use of
it.

I hope that we can get to the bottom of this.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
