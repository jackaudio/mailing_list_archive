Hi,

From reading the DENON forums it seems that their ASIO driver has some
settings that one has to be an Administrator in order to access - so
if you still have an issue when using John's suggested command line,
are you logged in as user with Administration privileges and is your
UAC turned off?

Kind regards,
GrahamG
