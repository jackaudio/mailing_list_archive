Isn't -C capture port?  From the output Lloyd sent earlier it appears that
this Denon device has no inputs:

[default ASIO input]
[default ASIO output]
Name = ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver
max Inputs = 0
max outputs = 4
ASIO min buffer size = 512
ASIO max buffer size = 512
ASIO preferred buffer size = 512
Buffer granularity = 0
Default sample rate = 0.00
end of list
cannot initialize driver
Jack server failed with -1
failed to open server


So Jack cannot be started in duplex mode, it has to be started in playback
only mode.  That bit me once before, I had a card configured to use a
S/PDIF input, but no S/PDIF data source running, so attempting to start
jack in duplex mode would crash because there was no valid input
available.  Something similar might be happening here if jack is being
started in duplex mode either explicitly or by default on a playback only
device.
