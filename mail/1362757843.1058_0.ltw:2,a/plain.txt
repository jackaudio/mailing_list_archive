Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Denon ASIO and Jack

Thanks for the input guys!
John, you are correct in that I cannot make any adjustments to the Denon ASIO
driver. I can only see what the parameters are with no user changes possible.

Graham, Yes I am running under administrator mode. 
Still a newbie, please explain UAC turned off?

Chris, you are correct in that the Denon 5500 controller will only output audio
(it has no inputs). Yes I have been using the duplex mode in Jack control.

Although Graham mentioned NOT to use Portaudio or the command line, I will try
and use it for John's new command line suggestion.

If I start Jack in 'playback only' mode, what if anything will I have to change
in the command:
jackd.exe -S -d portaudio -r44100 -p512 -P "ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver"
-C "ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver" 

I will try all of your suggestions and follow up asap.
Thanks again,
Lloyd
