Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Denon ASIO and Jack

Hi Everyone,
Yes we have made progress!
I used the command:  
jackd.exe -S -d portaudio -r44100 -p512 -P "ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver"
and PortAudio did not show any errors or crash.

But, I am still not able to see the Denon controller audio outputs in the Audio
Connection Kit's right side input client connect page. 
I DO see Virtual DJ with it's proper outputs on the left page (Output port)
side. On the right (input port) side all I see is 'system, playback 1 and 2'.
Audio is only heard from my laptop internal speakers. 
I have also tried changing my laptops default sound settings with no luck.

I am using two Denon 5500 controllers.
Each controller has two stereo outputs, therefore using two controllers, I have
a total of four stereo outputs (8 ports).
Yes I did change the .ini file for the proper I/O's.

I DO see the two Denon controllers in both I/O drop down boxes, each listed
individually for using either MME or Windows DirectSound. 
Denon DJ ASIO Driver is also listed in both of the drop down boxes.

I have tried using the Denon Dj ASIO Driver for both input and output, as well
as with combinations of 'Windows DirectSound::DN_HS5500' with no luck.

Current settings:
Interface = default
Audio: I tried both 'duplex' and 'playback only' modes with no results for
seeing the controllers in writable clients.
I/O Devices: I tried just about all listed combinations and still no Denon or
ASIO devices show for writable clients.

Note: when I originally tried ASIO4All, I WAS able to see the proper eight input
ports in writable clients.

Suggestions?

Thanks again,
Lloyd
