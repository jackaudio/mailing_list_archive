Ubuntu has nothing to do with it (unless you are reffering to user not  
belonging to audio group). Jack for Ubuntu is packaged in Debian.

The log says the user has no realtime privilege and there are two possible  
reasons. Make sure /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf is not named  
something else, and make sure user is in audio group (on Ubuntu users are  
not members of audio group, which the Debian package assumes).

Option 4 is a way to get around jack not being able to grab the card from  
PA.
Previous to version pulseaudio-3.0, because of a bug, PA will only let go  
of the card in certain circumstances - works best if you don't use PA  
actively, while trying to start jack.
This means, if you want to make sure jack starts when not using option 4,  
don't be playing flash videos on the browser while you do it. But this  
doesn't solve it for everyone.

To make PA connect to jack, use the jackdbus-detect module, packaged  
separately as "pulseaudio-module-jack".

Here's a page about pro audio on Ubuntu (probably containing some minor  
errors, but you might get the big picture reading it)
