// I don't have a "audio.conf" in security folder - i have created one,  
but it did not help ...

When installing jackd, you are given the option to use realtime or not. If  
answering no, you'd have a file called  
"/etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf.disabled". Rename it to audio.conf.  
Then reboot.
If you really don't have any files in the folder /etc/security/limits.d/,  
then create the audio.conf and add these two lines to it:

@audio - rtprio 95
@audio - memlock unlimited

Then reboot.


// I created the user :
// maitre@Serviteur:~$ groups
// maitre adm cdrom sudo audio dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare


//maitre@Serviteur:~$

//I have tried already to install PA jack package but it did not help ...  
Just tried again it did nothing ...

To make things easy, once you have everything in place, reboot. Then,  
don't do anything else but start jack.

First, make sure you are trying to start jack with the right device. Check  
what devices you have with:

$ cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [M66 ]: ICE1712 - M Audio Delta 66
    M Audio Delta 66 at 0xd040, irq 21
1 [SB ]: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI SB
    HDA ATI SB at 0xfe300000 irq 16
2 [NVidia ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia
    HDA NVidia at 0xfe080000 irq 24

As you see, I have three devices. The order of the devices may change at  
each boot. First, let's make sure jack start, no matter what PA is doing:

$ pasuspender -- jackd -d alsa -d hw:0

Then, try without suspending PA.

$ jackd -d alsa -d hw:0

If that failed, it was probably due to PA using the same device, and not  
letting go, in which case, you'll probably always want to suspend PA when  
you use jack (unless you have multiple audio devices, in which case PA can  
happily use one, while jack uses another).
