The lack of RT prios doesn't make jackd fail. OK, possible performance
degradation, but it would start at least.

The log especially says that it cannot acquire the audio interface.

The usual suspects are

   - pulseaudio not releasing the card (Ubuntu comes with PA by default)

   - some other app using the card

   - wrong driver settings for jackd, e.g., wrong device parameter

In the end, it boils down to the same old "lsof | grep /dev/snd"
followed by the appropriate kill command.


There are a couple of things that I find rather irritating about the
initial "bug" report:

    - The user assumes everybody speaks French and can hence read the
      log. The common agreement is to use LANG=C in bug reports.

    - The user assumes it's a bug in jackd and that the development list
      is responsible for fixing it. While there's certainly a marginal
      possibility for this, common sense says: When thousands of users
      can successfully run jackd, it's most likely something local, not
      a bug.

    - The user did not provide the actual jackd invocation line, that
      is, we're left with absolutely no information about his
      configuration.



This is where I draw the line. The particular device acquisition
question is already annoying enough on IRC. We should really add a
wiki/faq entry.
