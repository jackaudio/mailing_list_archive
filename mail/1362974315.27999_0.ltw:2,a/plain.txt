Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Unable to register 64bit JackRouter.dll (Windows)

Hi,

I've been using Jack (+Jack Control) on WIndows for quite some time now.
Recently Ableton 9 was released and since they now have a 64bit version available I need to be able to run Jack in 64bit mode as
well.
I followed the instructions here: http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows to try and register the JackRouter.dll, but for some reason I
just can't get it to work.

Using the command: regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\64bits\JackRouter.dll"
throws an error messaga saying "Unable to load JackRouter.dll"

I'm running cmd.exe as Administrator. I've tried both cd'ing into the "64bits" directory and using the full path.
Since I had Jack installed in a custom location (E:\ drive) I even uninstalled and reinstalled into the default location, without
any luck though.

So I hope someone here knows how to get the 64bit dll registered properly.

regards,
Peter Ginneberge
