Subject:     [Jack-Devel] "Stuck" sound when a Youtube audio stream terminates

Folks,

I have jack set up so i can play around with some audio applications. I've
got pulse audio going via the pulse-jack sink successfully I've got an asus
xonar stx (consumer level sound card). My set up is the following:


Realtime: off
frames/period: 256
samplerate: 44100
period/buffer: 2
port max: 256
timeout: 500
for a latency of 11.6 msec


I know the latency is huge, but i'm not doing anything serious with it at
the moment.


If i play a youtube video with this set up it plays fine. Half the time
though if i pause it, stop it or close the tab while it's playing, the last
second of it repeats over and over like a stuck record. Sometimes around 6
times, sometimes indefinitely If i stop then start jack (via the interface)
it goes back to normal. This is a buffer issue right?


Obviously, i don't need to be playing youtube videos with jack. I could
just stop jack before i play such a thing, but i'm curious as to what might
be going on. It's less of a *must fix* problem and more of a curiosity as i
learn more about jack.


What might be happening to cause this and how can i fix it?


Thanks,
