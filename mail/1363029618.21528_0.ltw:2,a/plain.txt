I have a similar issue with libflashsupport-jack, where upon start / stop
of a flash video a short (tenth of a sec or so) burst of noise is audible.
I imagine its something to do with the client setting up / quitting, not
zeroing, and JACK calling process() on the non-zero'ed buffer.

Me niether, but convinience of not having to stop JACK every youtube video
/ browser playback far outweights the hassle of a little noise... :)
