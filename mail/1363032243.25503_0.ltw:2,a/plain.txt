Have you guys tried using zita-a2j (drop-in replacement for
alsa_in/out) + ALSA's snd-aloop kernel module (loopback device)
instead?  I used to experience the same sort of bursts/pops, but now
that i switched to/use zita-a2j things seem to be working much better,
no pops on videos or anything like that. (i've been using it for a
year or two now).

zita-a2j manual: http://manned.org/zita-a2j/5ceefb08

it's pretty simple to setup

1, you just have to make sure the snd-aloop module is loaded, before
using zita-a2j;

'sudo modprobe snd-aloop'

2. then check which device it is numerated as (ie: hw:x,y). in my case;

$ cat /proc/asound/cards

0 [Loopback       ]: Loopback - Loopback
                           Loopback 1

3. then for zita-a2j (as an example), i am only interested in
receiving the outputs (no input devices);

/usr/bin/zita-a2j -j ALSA-in -dhw:0,1

...after this, all videos (in browser) work flawlessly :) from what i
understand/heard zita-a2j also handles resampling nicer than other
soutions, although i am not dead-positive on this. (citation needed).

It's definitely a must to not have to stop/disable jackd in any
situation on my desktop machine, anyway. ~ since Jackd is my default
soundserver. -> ie: no pulseaudio + i'm using ffado backend, so only
ALSA for midi keyboards/devices and loopback device for youtube, or
for the odd legacy (ALSA) app.

plus, i learn music on youtube too, so i couldn't disable jackd / not
a viable option ~ not if i plan on using my midi keys + soft-synth or
what to use any guitar amp modelling, while learning, anyway. ;)

> That I don't know I'm afraid :) Good luck!

zita-a2j + snd-aloop may be worth a try, there may even be a detailed
guide somewhere ~ although, someone else on the list can speak up, if
they know where one is. (i don't off hand).

cheerz
