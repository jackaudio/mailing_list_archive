&gt; Do you need pulseaudio? If not, using flash with jack, without
&gt; pulseaudio might be easier. I don't know.
&gt;
&gt; I'm using jack, pulseaudio isn't installed and when I play(ed) videos
&gt; with flash, than without jack. For me there never was the need to be
&gt; able to use jack and flash at the same time. I guess just a few people
&gt; need this option.
&gt;
&gt; IMO live is easier without fixing things for extraordinary
&gt; circumstances, that never ever will happen.

Ralf,

the OP came onto the list for *help*, not your opinions on XYZ topic /
anecdote from you. You did not even offer a single relevant hint, tip
or solution to the problem. :\

so what exactly was the point of replying to his request for help?

...and no, telling someone to 'live without' xyz app is not a viable
solution to his problem, nor is talking about whether or not PA is
unstable or not.

you did this on the sooperlooper mailing list a few months ago too,
when someone was looking for help to a problem, you went off on a rant
about why some distro wasn't good for proaudio. Please consider that
if you can't offer any real help, that maybe just maybe ~ you should
refrain from replying in those cases.

&gt; Good example :) for a case when it's useful to have audio for a video
&gt; from a browser and jackd running at the same time. I don't need this,
&gt; but there are very good learning videos, for everybody, from beginners
&gt; to very experienced master class musicians.

I wasn't trying to come up with a 'good example'. I am trying to offer
help / suggestions / solution to the OP.  I still don't understand why
you have even jumped into the conversation, when all that you are
essentially doing is adding white-noise.

..and IHMO, wanting to be able to multitask is pretty common stuff. I
could have just as easily used an example of watching a movie /
documentary, while working on a piano piece - or possibly wanting to
be able to hear sounds from a website, without having to close a
soft-synth that i may want to use in 5 minutes...or any number of
similar examples,

Jordan
