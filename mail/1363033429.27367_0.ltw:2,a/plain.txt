Ralf,

the OP came onto the list for *help*, not your opinions on XYZ topic /
anecdote from you. You did not even offer a single relevant hint, tip
or solution to the problem. :\

so what exactly was the point of replying to his request for help?

...and no, telling someone to 'live without' xyz app is not a viable
solution to his problem, nor is talking about whether or not PA is
unstable or not.

you did this on the sooperlooper mailing list a few months ago too,
when someone was looking for help to a problem, you went off on a rant
about why some distro wasn't good for proaudio. Please consider that
if you can't offer any real help, that maybe just maybe ~ you should
refrain from replying in those cases.

I wasn't trying to come up with a 'good example'. I am trying to offer
help / suggestions / solution to the OP.  I still don't understand why
you have even jumped into the conversation, when all that you are
essentially doing is adding white-noise.

..and IHMO, wanting to be able to multitask is pretty common stuff. I
could have just as easily used an example of watching a movie /
documentary, while working on a piano piece - or possibly wanting to
be able to hear sounds from a website, without having to close a
soft-synth that i may want to use in 5 minutes...or any number of
similar examples,

Jordan
