It's a bug where someone is churning on a stale buffer.

It's unlikely that the bug in in jackd.  It's more likely that it's a
bug in pulseaudio's jack module.  I suspect that at the end of a
stream the module is thinking, "there's no audio... so I'll do
nothing."  In fact, it must always zero the jack buffer whenever
jack's callback fires.  You should report it to the PA developers.
