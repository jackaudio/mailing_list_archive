Hi Ralf,

&gt;&gt; you did this on the sooperlooper mailing list a few months ago too
&gt;
&gt; Wow ;)
&gt;
&gt; that's not true, I never was and I'm still not subscribed to this list,
&gt; so this is absolutely impossible. Defamation for what reason?

You're right, it's not true (that it happened on sooperlooper list)
BUT instead happened here on jack-devel ~ while SL's dev was trying to
figure out a bug / problem with jack + sooperlooper. The thread was
called: "[Jack-Devel] jack2: lots of "unknown requests" when running
Sooperlooper"...

to which to offered nothing useful even related to the bug, then
proceeded to discuss how Archlinux wasn't a good proaudio distro and
some other unrelated to the issue 'noise'... Then after you were
confronted, the conversation ended with admitting you had nothing to
relevant to offer and you apologized for 'the noise'.

So defamation of character? NO. unless, confusing two mailing lists is
defamation (which obviously it is not). ..and i wasn't attacking you
to begin with. ~ just pointing out that those types of replies aren't
really helpful.

&gt; _Perhaps my writing style needs improvement_, but my hint in this case
&gt; was and is, that it could help to get rid of unneeded software, that
&gt; does cause issues. Neither you nor I can know what the OP does or
&gt; doesn't need, so I just recommended to think about the option to e.g.
&gt; remove pulseaudio or simply to reconsider, if the OP does need jack
&gt; running, when watching a YouTube video.

It's irrelevant to what the OP was asking ~ which was about the
bursts/popping on youtube videos.

&gt; Your example is a good example, when there is the need to run jack while
&gt; watching a video. I'm serious, not kidding.

there are countless examples just as valid. Mine is no better than any other.

&gt; You're confusing brainstorming with noise. A lot of people don't like me
&gt; and a lot of people are thankful for my help, that's live. IMO talking
&gt; about this is noise, so we perhaps could stop this.

I'm not confusing anything. You didn't offer help of any kind, but
instead went on a rant about your own opinions...and it's not 'that's
live', it's that's *life*. As for as ending this conversation; that
Works for me, I only replied to the list, since you have accused me of
'defamation of charactor' / slander ~ which is absurd :\

bye.

&gt; Regards,
&gt; Ralf
