Hi Ralf,

You're right, it's not true (that it happened on sooperlooper list)
BUT instead happened here on jack-devel ~ while SL's dev was trying to
figure out a bug / problem with jack + sooperlooper. The thread was
called: "[Jack-Devel] jack2: lots of "unknown requests" when running
Sooperlooper"...

to which to offered nothing useful even related to the bug, then
proceeded to discuss how Archlinux wasn't a good proaudio distro and
some other unrelated to the issue 'noise'... Then after you were
confronted, the conversation ended with admitting you had nothing to
relevant to offer and you apologized for 'the noise'.

So defamation of character? NO. unless, confusing two mailing lists is
defamation (which obviously it is not). ..and i wasn't attacking you
to begin with. ~ just pointing out that those types of replies aren't
really helpful.

It's irrelevant to what the OP was asking ~ which was about the
bursts/popping on youtube videos.

there are countless examples just as valid. Mine is no better than any other.

I'm not confusing anything. You didn't offer help of any kind, but
instead went on a rant about your own opinions...and it's not 'that's
live', it's that's *life*. As for as ending this conversation; that
Works for me, I only replied to the list, since you have accused me of
'defamation of charactor' / slander ~ which is absurd :\

bye.
