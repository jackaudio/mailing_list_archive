Hi Lloyd,

In Jack Control, if you have selected the 'ASIO::Denon Dj ASIO Driver'
and 'Playback only' with Frames/Period set to '512' and Sample Rate
set to '44100' and have then saved the configuration and clicked on
the Start button on the Jack Control interface, does the 'Started'
text show as yellow - indicating that the Jack Audio Server is
running?

If so, then the 'system -> playback_1/playback_2' in the right side
column of Writable Clients / Input Ports in the Connections window
SHOULD belong to the Denon Dj device.

Could you send me (just a personal reply to my email address and not
to the whole group) a screen capture of your Jack Control Setup screen
and a screen cap of your running Jack Control interface plus your
Connections screen?

Thanks,
GrahamG
