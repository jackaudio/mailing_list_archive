Hi Graham,

Thanks for looking into this. I understand Vista is on the way out, but it would still be nice to be able to run the 64bit version 
as I won't be upgrading my OS in the near future and I would love to continue using Jack (with Ableton 64bit).

I inspected theJackRouter.dll (64bit version) with Dependecy Walker (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) and it reported a missing dll 
(IEShims.dll).
I found that dll on my system (part of Internet Explorer) and copied it to the "64bits" directory, which fixed the reported error, 
but am still not able to register the JackRouter.dll.

Dependency Walker still reports the following:

Error: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in an implicitly dependent module.
Warning: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in a delay-load dependent module.

Which isn't very specific..

When looking at the Kernel32.dll it does list these 3 functions as being missing (not bound):

K32EnumProcessModules
K32EnumProcesses
K32GetModuleBaseNameA

kind regards,
Peter Ginneberge

&gt; Hi Peter,
&gt;
&gt; I know that Windows XP 64-bit users cannot register the 64-JackRouter
&gt; dll due to having a different PSAPI version. It may be that Vista
&gt; 64-bit has the same issue.  I think that the 64-bit JackRouter DLL is
&gt; compiled with PSAPI_VERSION=2 and so uses the kernel32.dll for calls
&gt; and not the psapi.dll.
&gt;
&gt; @Stephan, I found this link -
&gt; http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vcgeneral/thread/2e71e8da-4120-4eb6-8d14-a4de605d9765/
&gt; would it be possible to see if there is something here that can be
&gt; tested so that 64-bit JackRouter would work for XP/Vista users?
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; GrahamG
