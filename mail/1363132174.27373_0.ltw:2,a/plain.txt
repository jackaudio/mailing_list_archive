Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Unable to register 64bit JackRouter.dll (Windows)

Hi Graham,

Thanks for looking into this. I understand Vista is on the way out, but it would still be nice to be able to run the 64bit version 
as I won't be upgrading my OS in the near future and I would love to continue using Jack (with Ableton 64bit).

I inspected theJackRouter.dll (64bit version) with Dependecy Walker (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) and it reported a missing dll 
(IEShims.dll).
I found that dll on my system (part of Internet Explorer) and copied it to the "64bits" directory, which fixed the reported error, 
but am still not able to register the JackRouter.dll.

Dependency Walker still reports the following:

Error: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in an implicitly dependent module.
Warning: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in a delay-load dependent module.

Which isn't very specific..

When looking at the Kernel32.dll it does list these 3 functions as being missing (not bound):

K32EnumProcessModules
K32EnumProcesses
K32GetModuleBaseNameA

kind regards,
Peter Ginneberge
