Subject:     [Jack-Devel] superweird jack error

Hi list,
 
I've gotten a little further in my quest to get SuperCollider to run on a Cortex A9 guiless Ubuntu stick. That means I've only had one system freeze today trying ot start jackd2.
 
When I start it like this:
 
$ jackd -S -d alsa -d hw:H2 -r 44100 -n 3 -p 512
 
and with rtprio 70 and memlock unlimited
 
jackd seems to start up correctly:
 
jackdmp 1.9.10

JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10
creating alsa driver ... hw:H2|hw:H2|512|3|44100|0|0|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit
configuring for 44100Hz, period = 512 frames (11.6 ms), buffer = 3 periods
ALSA: final selected sample format for capture: 16bit little-endian
ALSA: use 3 periods for capture
ALSA: final selected sample format for playback: 16bit little-endian
ALSA: use 3 periods for playback
 
Now, trying to connect scsynth (from a self compiled SuperCollider 3.6.2) to jackd I get this completely new and weird error:
 
Cannot lock down 68157440 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)
Cannot lock down 2048917504 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)
Cannot lock down 25165824 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)
JackDriver: client name is ''
You cannot set callbacks on an active client
SC_AudioDriver: sample rate = 2890137600.000000, driver's block size = 33554432
SuperCollider 3 server ready.
ERROR: server failed to start
 
I get a very similar error (exact same memory numbers) when I try to connect the jack_simple_client.
 
I've googled the error and the only results that have come up had to do with  32bit vs 64bit and someone trying to run a Windows app via Wine.
 
Anyone have an idea what's going on?
 
Thanks,
Axel
