Hi Stephan,

I've reached the end of my knowledge here, so we've either reached a
bug/limitation or there is a setting that I'm not aware of...

We've got Lloyd's DENON DJ ASIO working with Jack for Windows - BUT it
will only show 1 stereo pair of speaker outputs when there are 4
stereo pairs.

I have an ASUS Sonar D1 soundcard which also has 4 stereo pairs - the
eight channels show up in other ASIO applications, but when using Jack
Control to start the Jack Server with default options I also only get
a single stereo output instead of the 4. So the ASUS ASIO driver does
allow access to the 8 channels, but they don't appear as connections
when using Jack for Windows.

When using ASIO4ALL with Jack for Windows we both see the eight
channels in Jack Control's Connections screen, so for one driver set
the defaults show all 8 and on the other only two channels. Any ideas?
Any command line options to try?

Kind regards,
GrahamG

&gt; Hi Graham,
&gt;
&gt; Great!, we're moving along;
&gt; Yes, I am receiving at least output from my Denon deck as required into my
&gt; mixer (great!).
&gt;
&gt; The problem is that I am only seeing 'playback 1, and playback 2 (one stereo
&gt; input).
&gt; I am using two Denon decks, each with two stereo outputs (total of four
&gt; stereo outs, should be 8 Jack ports).
&gt;
&gt;  Even with using only one deck, I should be seeing four 'playback' input
&gt; ports.
&gt; I should actually be seeing playback 1 thru playback 8 in writable clients
&gt; when using two Denon decks.
&gt;
&gt; In the future I will be adding an additional sound card to use the extra
&gt; Denon 'playback' stereo inputs, but right now I would just like to get the
&gt; basic setup running.
&gt;
&gt; I did use ASIO4All in the past with Jack, and I did see all required eight
&gt; input clients.
&gt;
&gt; What can I do to see the eight writable clients for these Denon units?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again for your help,
&gt; Lloyd O.
