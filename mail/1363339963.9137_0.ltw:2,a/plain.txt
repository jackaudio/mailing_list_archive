Thanks Stéphane, doing this showed me that I had an error when
starting jackd from Jack Control due to the 32-bit ASIO ASUS Driver
having a different name to the ASUS 64-bit ASIO driver

The verbose log showed that jackd was failing to open the ASIO driver
and so fellback to the default driver (dsound) which only exposes two
channels...

Now starting jackd from the command line with the correct driver name,
I have all eight channels available on my ASUS device.

Is there any possibility of getting Qjackctl/JackPortAudio for Windows
in 64-bit? :)

@Lloyd, could you send us a verbose log?

From the command line use something like

jackd -v -t5000 -dportaudio -d"ASIO::DENON DJ Asio" -r44100 -p512 > jacklog.txt

This will output the log to a jacklog.txt file in your Jack folder.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
