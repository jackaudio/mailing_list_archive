Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] superweird jack error

Hi Gabriel and everybody,

as I wrote in my earlier post the same thing happened when I just tried to connect jack_simple_client so it's definitely jack that's trying to allocate all that memory.

I don't remember turning on a "profile" option but I'll recomompile and turn debug on. Maybe this will give some more info.

Btw., two of the memory numbers in the error

Cannot lock down 68157440 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)
Cannot lock down 2048917504 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)
Cannot lock down 25165824 byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)

are the exact same numbers somebody else with the same error got here:

http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/jack2-32bit-vs-64bit-td42373.html

Everybody there seemed to assume it had to do with 32 bit vs 64 bit operation. But there is no 64 bit stuff at all on my computer.

Cheers,
Axel
