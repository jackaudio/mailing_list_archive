I cannot test myself.

Anyone else to  test and review the code?

The outcome of the bug (without a kludge) will result in addressless passive probe (bind to any on localhost when no adddress was specified explicitly) using IPv4 family even when v6 is available, so the kludge just blindly reorders the result.
