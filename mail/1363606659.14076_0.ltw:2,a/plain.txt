Hi,

As far as I know, we can only connect to one Audio Interface Output
using Jack for Windows, but as many software Inputs and Outputs as are
Jack Native or ASIO-JackRouter compatible. So you will only be able to
send audio from the PC to the eight Denon ASIO channels.

It may be possible to configure two different Audio Interfaces, one
for Inputs and the other for Outputs, but I have not tried this.

Kind regards,
GrahamG

Hi Graham,

Yes success!

Using your suggestions plus additional experimentation, the following
combination works (portaudio not opened):
In Jack Control;
Interface = ASIO::DENON DJ ASIO Driver
Audio = playback only
Output Device = (default)

Even though you mentioned not to use it, I had to change the command
line in PortAudio.
(PortAudio is not opened when using the working combination).

Jack PortAudio;
Command Line = -s -d portaudio -p44100 -p512 -p "DENON DJ ASIO"

Notice how the JackControl interface required the word 'Driver', and
the PortAudio cmd line did not require the word 'Driver'.

I now currently see the correct four output clients from Virtual DJ,
and I also see the correct eight inputs for the Denon decks (great!).

It looks like everything is working correctly now, except one last bit...

I have a second mixer sound card (Behringer Xenyx Q502USB) that I
would like to use in addition to the Denon decks. This Q502 is a small
USB mixer.
I would like to output this Behringer soundcard thru the extra
available audio outputs on the Denon decks.
I hoped that I would see the Behringer as an additional output client
along with Virtual DJ, but I do not see it listed at all (the only
output client that I see is Virtual DJ).

I DO see the Behringer soundcard in the JackControl interface as well
as the output device dropdown boxes as: USB Audio CODEC.

Questions:
1 - Is Jack able to 'see' two different output clients in this current
'playback only' mode?
2 - While in the 'playback only' mode, is it possible to have both
Virtual DJ and the Behringer soundcard output from the Denon decks at
the same time via Jack?



 Thanks Graham, you've bee a great help!
Lloyd O.
