That is indeed possible and one of the reasons I started using Jack in the first place.
I have a Fast Track Pro with no speakers attached to it. 
Speakers are attached to the onboard sound card on my PC.

With Jack I can use the Fast Track Pro for input and the PC speakers (default windows output device) as output.

In case anyone is interested in how to do that:
