Hi Lloyd,

Does your other USB-Audio device have an ASIO driver?

You won't be able to mix driver levels when accessing different audio
devices for inputs and outputs. If your device does have an ASIO
driver, then in Jack Control -> Setup set the Interface value to
(default), the Audio value to Duplex, and then select the USB-Audio
ASIO driver in the Input Device '>' drop down and the Denon Dj in the
Output Device '>', and then modify those values to reflect their
64-bit equivalents (which you got from jackd -dportaudio -l). Save
that and then see if the Jack Audio server will start.

If your other USB-Audio device does not have an ASIO driver, then you
can use ASIO4ALL with it, but you will need to enter the advanced
setup of ASIO4ALL once the Jack Audio server connects to it in order
to disable ASIO4ALL using the Denon Dj device... and only then
configure the Output Device value, etc.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
