Is there a way I can specify/force, when I load netmanager, which network interface it should be listening to, for slaves to connect ?

If you want to use unicast then providing IP to netmanager unambiguously binds to that IP, whichever interface it is assigned to.
There's a trcik here though - if you're using secondary IPs - UDP packet might (or actually will) still leave the system from system default IP. 
Simply because outgoing socket is recreated once probe is received, and when it is recreated it's not bound anymore, just an ephemeral port.
You can force system IP (default outgoing IP to use by the system) by creating a route with source IP
# ip ro add <destination> <gateway> src <secondary ip>
i.e.
ip ro add 2.2.2.2 via 1.1.1.1 dev eth1 src 1.1.1.10 
now whenever connection will be initiated towards that host system will chose that source address unless asked otherwise explicitly.

If you need multicast - there's another story.
Since you're using ubuntu you can try out my proposed patched package having this feature.
See neighbouring thread for details.
PPA is at https://launchpad.net/~rufferson/+archive/snd
In that version you can specifiy all, explicit or default interface to listen for multicast on.

Regards,
Ruslan
