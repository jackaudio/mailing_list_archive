&gt; &gt;&gt; The issue with bulldozer (and piledriver) is that two integer cores share
&gt; &gt;&gt; a single floating point core, so the scheduler thinks it can schedule two
&gt; &gt;&gt; cores, but depending on whether the processes being scheduled are mostly
&gt; &gt;&gt; integer or mostly floating point, it might work well or there might be
&gt; &gt;&gt; contention for the single FP core.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; AMD says (in the optimization manual):
&gt; &gt; | The AMD Family 15h processor floating point unit (FPU) was designed to
&gt; &gt; | provide four times the raw FADD and FMUL bandwidth as the original AMD
&gt; &gt; | Opteron and Athlon 64 processors.  It achieves this by means of two
&gt; &gt; | 128-bit fused multiply-accumulate (FMAC) units which are supported by
&gt; &gt; | a 128-bit high-bandwidth load-store system. [...]
&gt; &gt; | The FPU can receive up to four ops per cycle. These ops can only be
&gt; &gt; | from one thread, but the thread may change every cycle. Likewise the
&gt; &gt; | FPU is four wide, capable of issue, execution and completion of four
&gt; &gt; | ops each cycle. Once received by the FPU, ops from multiple threads
&gt; &gt; | can be executed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So if you're running two FP-heavy threads that happen to interfere with
&gt; &gt; each other in the most negative way, the theoretical performance will
&gt; &gt; only be double that of earlier CPUs ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In practice, the FPU sharing matters only if you use 256-bit AVX
&gt; &gt; instructions, because those must be executed in two steps.
&gt; 
&gt; It is expected that performance of the newer CPU family is better. The
&gt; point is the possibility of xruns happening occasionally at 50% DSP
&gt; load.

Has this been tested? 

It is interesting, although I'm not upgrading for nearly 2 years... but
I do recommend systems to people.. currently I have a core i7 desktop
with hyper-threading turned off for this.. I recommend core i5 ... but
this machine will become my home server in 2 years so it's okay for
that.. 

If AMD can use all 8 cores and not suffer in due to shared fpu (i.e. not
using 256 bit AVX from how I read this) then the AMD becomes better
value for money ..
