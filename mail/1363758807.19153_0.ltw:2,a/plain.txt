Has this been tested? 

It is interesting, although I'm not upgrading for nearly 2 years... but
I do recommend systems to people.. currently I have a core i7 desktop
with hyper-threading turned off for this.. I recommend core i5 ... but
this machine will become my home server in 2 years so it's okay for
that.. 

If AMD can use all 8 cores and not suffer in due to shared fpu (i.e. not
using 256 bit AVX from how I read this) then the AMD becomes better
value for money ..
