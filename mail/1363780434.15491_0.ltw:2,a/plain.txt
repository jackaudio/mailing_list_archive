Bulldozer has been out for some time now. Maybe it's indicative of
something that no one here seems to be running a Bulldozer system,
especially since the Piledriver based Vishera chips have since been
released as well. I considered upgrading but looking at the benchmarks
there doesn't seem to be much advantage over the aging Phenom X6 sitting in
my desktop.
