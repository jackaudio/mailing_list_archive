Hi All,

Unfortunately no luck so far.

Peter- I followed your video's suggestions with no luck.

I also followed Grahams suggestions, and I do see 'VDJ' and 'system' in the
output clients, and 'system' in the input clients. 
Problem is that they both show the wrong amount of inputs/outputs (Back to the
same issue that started this thread!).

Seems like with my setup, the Duplex mode has a problem assigning the proper
amount of input/output ports.

I'm a bit confused on the relationship between PortAudio and JackControl, but
previously the few changes I did make in the PortAudio cmd string along with the
config settings in JackControl seemed like it helped.

Any other config settings to try for JackControl?

I have not been using PortAudio. 
Currently in PortAudio, only the default command line is shown: "C:\Program
Files\Jack\jackd.exe".
Is there a possible way to accomplish this using a PortAudio command string
instead of JackControl?

Thanks again,
Lloyd O.
