Subject:     [Jack-Devel] someone needs to fix track.jackaudio.org or i will delete it

For many months now, trac.jackaudio.org has been broken. It was broken by
an unannounced change made by the web hosting service to mysql. The same
change broke ffado.org as well, but Jonathan Woithe figured it all out and
got their stuff back up very quickly.

trac.jackaudio.org has been sitting there spewing errors in its log file.
The web hosting service recently deleted a 0.8TB log file (and yes, that
was a T, not a G). They are watching the same file grow in size again.

I don't want to delete the jack bug tracker, but I was not involved in its
original installation and am not going to get sidetracked into trying to
fix it myself.

I can provide any person with reasonable credibility with ssh access, so
that they can do whatever Jonathan did for FFADO, and get it working again.

If someone does not step up within this week (March 25th-31st), I will be
forced to take trac.jackaudio.org completely offline.
