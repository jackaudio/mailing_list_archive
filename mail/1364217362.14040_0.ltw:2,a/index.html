Hi,

if there's no better candidate, I may try to do it.

&gt; For many months now, trac.jackaudio.org has been broken. It was broken by an
&gt; unannounced change made by the web hosting service to mysql. The same change
&gt; broke ffado.org as well, but Jonathan Woithe figured it all out and got
&gt; their stuff back up very quickly.
&gt;
&gt; trac.jackaudio.org has been sitting there spewing errors in its log file.
&gt; The web hosting service recently deleted a 0.8TB log file (and yes, that was
&gt; a T, not a G). They are watching the same file grow in size again.
&gt;
&gt; I don't want to delete the jack bug tracker, but I was not involved in its
&gt; original installation and am not going to get sidetracked into trying to fix
&gt; it myself.
&gt;
&gt; I can provide any person with reasonable credibility with ssh access, so
&gt; that they can do whatever Jonathan did for FFADO, and get it working again.
&gt;
&gt; If someone does not step up within this week (March 25th-31st), I will be
&gt; forced to take trac.jackaudio.org completely offline.
