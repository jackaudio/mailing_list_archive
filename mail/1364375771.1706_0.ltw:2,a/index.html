&gt; I can provide any person with reasonable credibility with ssh access, so
&gt; that they can do whatever Jonathan did for FFADO, and get it working again.
&gt;
&gt; If someone does not step up within this week (March 25th-31st), I will be
&gt; forced to take trac.jackaudio.org completely offline.

I would be willing to take a look at this for you given appropriate access.
As I mentioned in the post Clemens quoted, I expect it will be relatively
straight-forward.  If you would like me to do this, the restoration may slip
into the early part of next week (1-3 April) depending on when access
details come through; I have a rather busy Easter weekend.
