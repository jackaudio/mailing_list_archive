Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JAudioLibs (JNAJack, etc.) code on GitHub

Hi All,

Just a note that I've extracted JNAJack (Java bindings for JACK) from
the Praxis LIVE repository, along with other elements of the
JAudioLibs code, and it's now on GitHub at
https://github.com/jaudiolibs  Should make it easier for people to
work with (and contribute to!) the code.

Downloads and other facilities are still on the Google Code site at
http://code.google.com/p/java-audio-utils/ for now.

Best wishes,

Neil
