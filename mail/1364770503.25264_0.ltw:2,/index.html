&gt; &gt; I can provide any person with reasonable credibility with ssh access, so

&gt; &gt; If someone does not step up within this week (March 25th-31st), I will be
&gt; &gt; forced to take trac.jackaudio.org completely offline.

&gt; I would be willing to take a look at this for you given appropriate access.
&gt; As I mentioned in the post Clemens quoted, I expect it will be relatively
&gt; straight-forward.  If you would like me to do this, the restoration may
&gt; slip
&gt; into the early part of next week (1-3 April) depending on when access
&gt; details come through; I have a rather busy Easter weekend.

Jonathan, just let me have your ssh key and I'll enable ssh access to
jackaudio.org for you.

Thanks for offering. And also to Jano, who I hope will agree it is probably
more efficient for Jonathan to take a look since he solved once before.
