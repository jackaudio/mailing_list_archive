&gt; &gt; Then Robin it would be great to look at this code and possibly test

&gt; 
&gt; Basil's work can be rebased without any conflicts onto the current HEAD.
&gt; It needs some minor modifications (JackNetTool.h) to compile:
&gt;   https://github.com/x42/jack2/commits/nopackedstructs
&gt; and then works as promised - tested on arm and i386.

Hi Robin, Thanks for rebasing my patches and testing them! I apologize
for not responding sooner :-(.

In case it's useful, I've now rebased my tree and properly incorporated
the JackNetTool.h fixes:

https://github.com/basilnut/jack2.git

Feel free to use this updated tree, or not; it's not important to me
which path the patches take :-).

&gt; Interestingly enough, the ABI changes do not seem to make a difference
&gt; on i386 nor on armel. (basil's jackd2 was configured with --classic
&gt; --alsa --dbus --firewire).

The ABI changes I called out are pretty obscure. To the best of my
knowledge, none of jack2's own type layouts changed. The main concern
would be if users of the API have jack2 types as members of their own
structs, and even then, there's a decent chance that they'll get "lucky"
and not see any change.

&gt; On i386: Ardour3, xjadeo, zita-a2j (all compiled with jack2-1.9.9) as
&gt; well as baudline continue to work just fine with initial tests. On arm I
&gt; only tested some commandline tools jack_capture, jltcgen. No problems
&gt; either, so far.

Great! Thanks for the testing!

Basil
