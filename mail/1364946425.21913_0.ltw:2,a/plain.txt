Hi Robin, Thanks for rebasing my patches and testing them! I apologize
for not responding sooner :-(.

In case it's useful, I've now rebased my tree and properly incorporated
the JackNetTool.h fixes:

https://github.com/basilnut/jack2.git

Feel free to use this updated tree, or not; it's not important to me
which path the patches take :-).

The ABI changes I called out are pretty obscure. To the best of my
knowledge, none of jack2's own type layouts changed. The main concern
would be if users of the API have jack2 types as members of their own
structs, and even then, there's a decent chance that they'll get "lucky"
and not see any change.

Great! Thanks for the testing!
