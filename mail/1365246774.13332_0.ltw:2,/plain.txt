Now that all the code is on github, the wiki is on github and
tickets are also offered on github, I'd like to direct users to github,
too.

IMHO, the trac only serves two purposes: documentation of the past
(closed tickets) and a list of maybe unhandled issues:


   http://trac.jackaudio.org/report/1

What I really don't want is people starting to edit the trac wiki, so
we'd end up with duplicated divergent information.

I hence suggest to delete as much as possible from the trac wiki (all
that has been successfully transferred to github), go through the open
tickets, maybe recreate the non-cruft on github and eventually set the
entire trac to read-only mode.


The least we should do is keep users away from it by mentioning the
github resources in all appropriate places (FAQ, jackaudio.org, you name
it...)



Just my €0.02
