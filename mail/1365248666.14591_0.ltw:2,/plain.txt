Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Merge jackd1 and jackd2 code bases

Hi!

Please have a look at the following situation:

   http://trac.jackaudio.org/ticket/227#comment:1

An utterly trivial ticket that hasn't been dealt with for two years.
Worse, the same fix required three individual commits, because common
code between jackd1 and jackd2 isn't properly shared but replicated.

Can we please align the two projects and share things like tools,
example-clients and man pages? Given the lack of manpower, doing
everything twice doesn't exactly help.



Cheers
