Perhaps I'm really barking up the wrong tree, but I'm learning in the
process here..

Add the flag as described previously to JackPortFlags,
Every time a port has its "active" flag toggled, trigger the existing
GraphOrderCallback.
I think this is what makes most patchbays update / redraw, hence state will
be up to date.

That would avoid the race between a client marking active (and hence its
ports becoming active),
and the jack_port_flags() call.. since the callback updates state, and the
patchbay client won't have to poll?

Perhaps I'm understanding the race wrong?
