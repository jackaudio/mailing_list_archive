&gt; &gt; the graph order callback only reflects changes in connectivity.
&gt; Essentially an "active" flag change would signify an chance in

&gt; Perhaps not directly, but a possible change in connectivity, since a port
&gt; getting deactivated would have its connections cut?
&gt; I'll agree its slightly changing the exact meaning of the
&gt; GraphOrderCallback, but only to include a new feature?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; even if you use other callbacks, they arrive in specific threads,
&gt; probably not the thread that got the port info.
&gt; That's for the (patchbay) client to deal with..? Enter the apps messaging
&gt; system or trylock()?
&gt;

you're really missing the point here.

the only way you could possibly solve this issue is if the JACK API allowed
for something like this:

   jack_lock_graph (client_handle);
   jack_get_ports (client_handle, ....);
   DO_SOMETHING_WITH_PORTS (client_handle, ports, ...)
   jack_unlock_graph (client_handler);

but oops, now the client has locked the graph meaning nothing can be added,
removed or reconnected and no client can arrive or depart. so now you have
to have the notion of an
"all-other-clients-can't-touch-graph-but-i-can-lock" which is absurd, and
baroque.

the API in this type of system is inherently racy. you can't fix that with
bandaids. the state of the world can change at ANY time, and even if you
get told about it, that wiill not help you deal with the fact that some of
the ports you've been told about have changed state or that there may be
new ports that you don't know about.
