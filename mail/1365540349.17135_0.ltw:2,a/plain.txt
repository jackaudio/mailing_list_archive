you're really missing the point here.

the only way you could possibly solve this issue is if the JACK API allowed
for something like this:

   jack_lock_graph (client_handle);
   jack_get_ports (client_handle, ....);
   DO_SOMETHING_WITH_PORTS (client_handle, ports, ...)
   jack_unlock_graph (client_handler);

but oops, now the client has locked the graph meaning nothing can be added,
removed or reconnected and no client can arrive or depart. so now you have
to have the notion of an
"all-other-clients-can't-touch-graph-but-i-can-lock" which is absurd, and
baroque.

the API in this type of system is inherently racy. you can't fix that with
bandaids. the state of the world can change at ANY time, and even if you
get told about it, that wiill not help you deal with the fact that some of
the ports you've been told about have changed state or that there may be
new ports that you don't know about.
