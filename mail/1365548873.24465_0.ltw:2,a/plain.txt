I disagree with this. Client call jack_get_ports and got "snapshot" of Jack Graph. Now client try process this port using different API (e.g. jack_connnect, jack_disconnect, jack_port_by_name etc.). Now you say that things can meantime change .. OFC here we agree .. but ..

- new port will be add => client didn't know about it (yet) - this nothing change for us in this moment.

- port removed => this is the real error - functions that try to use this port (port-name) should fail. And they did e.g. jack_connect return error, because port doesn't exists anymore. It's fine.

- port is inactive - ?? Client suppose that port exits - and it exists, so it's "broken" ... but because jack server KNOW this before serve it to client  - it should at least try to avoid problems.

What I want to say - we can't fix this ultimately - but jack server should at least TRY to protect client from evil - and in this case he definitely can. So , once again - jack_get_ports shouldn't return broken ports if he know they are useless for client.

I also can't find a problem in jack_is_port_active. Example:
jack_get_ports(....)
<--- obviously some time here - and things can change ..
jack_port_t* port = jack_get_port_by_name ( ...)
<-- still things can change - but if we got port == NULL we fail here and remove port from patchbay graph.
jack_port_is_active ( client, port); 
# return 0 on success i.e. port still exists and is active. Otherwise we can return some codes like "1 - not active, 2 - not exists .. etc, but for me (as patch manager maintainer) it's clear that in this short time window port is broken. I just mark it as "unusable" .. and wait for another event.

BTW. thanks for attention in this thread.
