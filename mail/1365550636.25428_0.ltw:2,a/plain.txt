you can't protect them from *all* "evil", so the question is : which types
of "evil" will we attempt to avoid.

mostly agreed.

so for now, you know that the port is active ... so what? you can't do
anything useful with this information.

every time you use jack_get_ports(), you get, as you noted above, a
"snapshot" of things. there is no way to prolong the life of the
information in the snapshot. when you come to use the information, you
*must* be ready for some or all of it to be invalid or out of date.

i think this is a somewhat separate question to whether or not we should
return ports that *at the time of jack_get_ports()* are known to be
inactive. logic and cleanliness would suggest that we should not. however,
the comparison with other kinds of potential "invalidation" of port
information says "it doesn't really matter".
