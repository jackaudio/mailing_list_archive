That's what I said - we can't protect from all error. Client should always check return of each API call , but jack server should return consistent state at the moment, IMO.

Otherwise we can return some codes like "1 - not active, 2 - not exists .. etc, but for me (as patch manager maintainer) it's clear that in this short time window port is broken. I just mark it as "unusable" .. and wait for another event.

I just know that in this short time window port is valid. You a little bit reverse my thought. I mean that (inactive port == useless == not exists for regular apps). It can exists internally in jack, but it's useless for app. I don't even try to prove that this resolve all problems. It just made things better. That's all.

> every time you use jack_get_ports(), you get, as you noted above, a "snapshot" of things. there is no way to prolong the life of the information in the snapshot. when you come to use the information, you *must* be ready for some or all of it to be invalid or out of date.

Try to my POV (as patchbay manager). Or we have two state port exists (== useful), not exists ... or we have three state - exists, inactive, not exists. For me it's doesn't matter which approach YOU choose. If jack server provide API to ask "is port is OK" - then I call this. If this call will be too late - and port just disappear - then I remove it from my screen. I just don't want to "show" broken ports for user.

If user try connect that doesn't exists - it got error - and port will disappear from patchbay. What can I say to user when port exists but I can't connect them ?

Fact that we can't resolve all problems shouldn't stop us from try to improve current situation. That's all.

BTW. after all I think that Harry's idea is most flexible - it doesn't ruin anything. Maybe there is a race - but you can also got error while trying jack_port_flags, or jack_get_port_by_name .. problem is that - we don't know how long port will be inactive - so for *now* we just mark port as "inactive" .. and we see in next iteration. That's all. If shit happen meantime - then we try to adapt ;-)
