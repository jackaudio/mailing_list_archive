Of course its possible that the port is removed in the mean time. In
that case there is absolutely no problem because there is no need to
care about a non-existent port because you can't (dis)connect it anyway.

This 'problem' manifests in vastly more complex connection management
code, as connection managers have to additionally monitor that their
connection attempt worked and may have to repeatedly retry making the
connection later because it still may not be active yet.

If inactive ports are not listed then connection managers may simply
fire & forget the connect request. If the port no longer exists, so
what, it can't be connected anyway.

Of course making this change doesn't fix all problems, but it does help
one. Surely that's an advantage?
