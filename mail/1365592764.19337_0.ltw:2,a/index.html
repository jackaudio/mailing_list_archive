&gt; &gt;         Any chance that adding a flag,  "JackPortIsActive" to
&gt; &gt;         JackPortFlags allows the functionality to be implemented?
&gt; &gt;         
&gt; &gt;         On activation, the JACK server marks all of the client owned
&gt; &gt;         ports as "active".
&gt; &gt;         
&gt; &gt;         Patchbay managers etc call jack_port_flags() and can query if
&gt; &gt;         its an "active" port or not?
&gt; &gt;         
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; there is always a race ... sometime between when you get the ports and
&gt; &gt; when you use the information, ports could be added, removed or become
&gt; &gt; inactive.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course its possible that the port is removed in the mean time. In
&gt; that case there is absolutely no problem because there is no need to
&gt; care about a non-existent port because you can't (dis)connect it anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; This 'problem' manifests in vastly more complex connection management
&gt; code, as connection managers have to additionally monitor that their
&gt; connection attempt worked and may have to repeatedly retry making the
&gt; connection later because it still may not be active yet.
&gt; 
&gt; If inactive ports are not listed then connection managers may simply
&gt; fire &amp; forget the connect request. If the port no longer exists, so
&gt; what, it can't be connected anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course making this change doesn't fix all problems, but it does help
&gt; one. Surely that's an advantage? 

Exactly ;-)

Harry's idea is also valid - we can know is port is active and for example mark it "gray". It's not a problem that this info would be outdated - we already accept this approach in other API calls. As was said by Paul and Stephane - even port name could be outdated on this time i.e. when we call jack_get_ports , we must humbly accept scenario where in some other thread this port is just right now removed ;-) ... but this shouldn't stop us to TRY process this port - because then it will be 
paranoid ;-)
