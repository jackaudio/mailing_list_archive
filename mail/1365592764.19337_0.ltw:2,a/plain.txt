Exactly ;-)

Harry's idea is also valid - we can know is port is active and for example mark it "gray". It's not a problem that this info would be outdated - we already accept this approach in other API calls. As was said by Paul and Stephane - even port name could be outdated on this time i.e. when we call jack_get_ports , we must humbly accept scenario where in some other thread this port is just right now removed ;-) ... but this shouldn't stop us to TRY process this port - because then it will be 
paranoid ;-)
