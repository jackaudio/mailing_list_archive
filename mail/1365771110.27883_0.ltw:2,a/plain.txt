Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Getting started with jack

Hi ! I'm trying to get started with Overtone <http://overtone.github.io/>.
I need to make jack properly run on my computer, but I have some trouble.
Would you be nice and help me?
I'm using Arch GNU/Linux:

> [caocoa@C40C04 tutorial]$ uname -a
> Linux C40C04 3.8.6-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Apr 6 07:27:01 CEST 2013
> x86_64 GNU/Linux
>
I've installed jack:

> [caocoa@C40C04 tutorial]$ yaourt -Qs jack
> extra/jack 0.121.3-7
>     A low-latency audio server
> extra/qjackctl 0.3.10-1
>     A Qt front-end for the JACK low-latency audio server
> local/supercollider-jack 1976-1 (supercollider-quarks)
>     SuperCollider quark: A set of classes to interface JACK tools (on
> Linux). Author: Marije Baalman.

but I'm unable to start it properly :-(, as shown above:

Even if I follow advice for alsa & jack given on that site (
http://jackaudio.org/pulseaudio_and_jack), it still doesn't work:
