Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack 1.9.9 - proper way to build 'multilib' on 64bit? - since apparently the --mixed flag is now broken

Hey List,

> Is there any workaround for this problem ? I know that KXStudio have proper package - what this can't be fixed on upstream level ? I tried to use 1.9.9.5 official release.

I was the OP for the original posting of jack2/multlib problem ~ and i
too would like an update on this (it's been half of a year).. I
believe i also asked if there was an alternative way of building
jack2/multilib and never got a response on that either.  I've been
stuck on Jack 1.9.8 for months and months and would like to update.

Archlinux is also stuck shipping 1.9.8/multilib since Dec/2012. It
would be nice to have a resolution here, since jack2/multilib is
important and i should also note: jack's build system is still
providing --mixed flag which is obviously borken and has been for a
long time...

maybe putting up some documentation on how to workaround this might be helpful.
