jack_on_info_shutdown is called when the *server* quits.

This code was supposed to close clients that the program incorrectly forgot to close. It is sometimes rather necessary (you now libjack trying to do the job because developers don't use the API correctly..)

Do you mean double "delete" yes?

Please send me a test program that shows the problem.
