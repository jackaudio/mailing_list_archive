The best that can be done is to signal another thread to correctly do cleanup, that is by calling "jack_client_close" (since "jack_client_close" cannot be called directly in the context of the thread that calls the shutdown callback).

The example code I wrote, such a change would be trivial.

However, I'm allocating jack clients from two threads, so now I have to 
put locks around every libjack call,
check if any jack client has gotten a shutdown message, or if 
jack_client_open returns NULL in case jackd decides to exit while I'm in 
the middle of allocating clients.
Then I would have to make sure that all jack clients are deallocated 
before attempting to make new clients.
I would also have to check if my program is using libjack1 or libjack2, 
since libjack1 does not do this.

All this so that programs can save maybe a kilobyte of ram when not 
following the API correctly.

Bob.
