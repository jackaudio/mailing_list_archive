Subject:     [Jack-Devel] m-audio FastTrack Ultra 8R no playback with hw device

Hi everyone,

I've been using the M-Audio FastTrack Ultra 8R with jack for a while
now and everything works fine with the plughw alsa device, but playback
does not work with the hw interface.

This is what I get when starting jack:

$ jackd -d alsa -d hw:2  -r 44100

configuring for 44100Hz, period = 1024 frames (23.2 ms), buffer = 2 periods
ALSA: final selected sample format for capture: 24bit little-endian
ALSA: use 2 periods for capture
ALSA: final selected sample format for playback: 24bit little-endian
ALSA: use 2 periods for playback


Nothing suspicious here.

$ file test.wav
test.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, mono 44100 Hz

$ mplayer -ao jack test.wav

No sound.

The wave file has the right sampling rate and works fine with another
audio interface. I also tried varius other sampling rates and
parameters. None worked.

Am I missing something? Any ideas?
