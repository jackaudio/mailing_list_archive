It looks like this person has decided to do things a little differently
but without supplying patches to the list.

Just out of interest is there any reason that the so called improvements
s/he has made are not possible to add as optional (maybe compile time
optional) "features" to existing jack1/2/3?

Seems like the main difference between jack1 and this fork is use of
direct mmap by default.

Not sure what their specific improvements to the session protocol are.
Maybe they would like to share some more details?

I have to disagree the session management has been holding anyone back
though. That seems to be a little excessive. From the tone of the article
I guess this person prefers to communicate over IRC.
