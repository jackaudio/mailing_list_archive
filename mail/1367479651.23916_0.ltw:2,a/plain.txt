Right now my configuration is this:

/usr/bin/jackd -v -dalsa -r44100 -p256 -n2 -D -Chw:1 -Phw:1

But I'm actually using all kinds of values for -r and -p and sometimes use
-n3.

I'm currently running jackd from Fedoras jack-audio-connection-kit package.

jackd --version
jackdmp 1.9.9.5

But I also got it working on a Raspberry Pi running in Raspian. Until
recently I had one machine still running on Kubuntu without any problem
with regard to Jack/Fast Track Ultra.

I've been involved in the Alsa modifications to get the Fast Track Ultra
series working on Linux so I've tested many, many Kernel/Distro/jack
combinations in the last 2 years. I have not had any problem to play back
*through Jack* for a very long time (that is, if I managed to get
pulseaudio out of the way...).

I still think that there's probably something wrong with mplayer use of
Jack. But I can't confirm since the version of mplayer on my machines
doesn't even know about Jack. Maybe you should test with another program.
(E. g. I like to test my Jack setups with the Hydrogen drum machine.)

Regards,

Felix
