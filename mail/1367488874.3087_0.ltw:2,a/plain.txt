Ardour 3, hydrogen and every other jack client show exactly the same
symptoms. So I would exclude mplayer as the source of the problem.

I suspect it has to do with the parameter selection that jack does at
startup. i.e. you can't specify the format.

Also it did work once with some kernel/jack1 combination, but
unfortunately I can't remember which versions. I tried some of the last
jack1 versions and kernels 3.5.6 through 3.9.0...
