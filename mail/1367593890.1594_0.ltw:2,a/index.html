Hi list,

I have an embedded application that makes use of jack (Version 1.9.8).
I have started seeing crashes from the clients in the JackError() call.

The stack trace shows that the thread executing (Which is handling the
JackSocketChannel::Execute call) receives is being killed
(sigcancel_handler is called) and since the thread is in
CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS mode, it crashes since an unsafe function is
called (vnsprintf).

The client I am using is actually unaware of using Jack at all, it is
using the alsa jack plugin, and it opens/closes the alsa devices many
times during its lifetime.

Now, I have a few doubts:
- Why are threads created with cancellation type PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS?
  Is this because the realtime threads need this or is there some other reason?
- Would it be possible to mark the threads used by the JackMessageBuffer and
  JackSocketClientChannel as PTHREAD_CANCEL_DELAYED instead?
- Why is fThread.Kill() used in JackSocketClientChannel::Stop instead of fThread.Stop()?
  The latter should still work, and allow the Execute() to terminate it communication
  with the server.

Thanks in advance,
Luciano
