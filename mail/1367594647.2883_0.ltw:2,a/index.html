Le 3 mai 2013 &#xE0; 17:11, "MONTANARO Luciano (MM)" &lt;[hidden]&gt; a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Hi list,
&gt; 
&gt; I have an embedded application that makes use of jack (Version 1.9.8).
&gt; I have started seeing crashes from the clients in the JackError() call.
&gt; 
&gt; The stack trace shows that the thread executing (Which is handling the
&gt; JackSocketChannel::Execute call) receives is being killed
&gt; (sigcancel_handler is called) and since the thread is in
&gt; CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS mode, it crashes since an unsafe function is
&gt; called (vnsprintf).
&gt; 
&gt; The client I am using is actually unaware of using Jack at all, it is
&gt; using the alsa jack plugin, and it opens/closes the alsa devices many
&gt; times during its lifetime.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I have a few doubts:
&gt; - Why are threads created with cancellation type PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS?
&gt;  Is this because the realtime threads need this or is there some other reason?

Old written code&#x85;. AFAIR PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED was not working so well (or possibly not the same way on test OS like Linux and OSX) so PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS was choses.

&gt; - Would it be possible to mark the threads used by the JackMessageBuffer and
&gt;  JackSocketClientChannel as PTHREAD_CANCEL_DELAYED instead?

You mean PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED?  Possibly yes.  Try to test it.

&gt; - Why is fThread.Kill() used in JackSocketClientChannel::Stop instead of fThread.Stop()?

Same answer as before, Stop was not working reliably on all testes OSs, so Kill was used.


&gt;  The latter should still work, and allow the Execute() to terminate it communication
&gt;  with the server.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Luciano
