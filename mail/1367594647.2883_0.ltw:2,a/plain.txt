Old written code. AFAIR PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED was not working so well (or possibly not the same way on test OS like Linux and OSX) so PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS was choses.

You mean PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED?  Possibly yes.  Try to test it.

Same answer as before, Stop was not working reliably on all testes OSs, so Kill was used.
