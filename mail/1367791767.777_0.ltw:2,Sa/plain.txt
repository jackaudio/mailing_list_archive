Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack on arm hf

Hi list,
 
the guy with the UG802 tv stick again. I've tried to get Jack to run on this rk3066 arm hf computer without success for a while now. I posted some of the weird error messages on this list but nothing got solved. So, I'd like to ask a more general question:
 
Developers, is anyone working on or even interested in getting Jack to run on an arm cortex a9 platform? What are possible problems?
 
In my opinion, these cheap little sticks and tablets could be a wonderful platform for creating audio fx boxes, sound installations etc. They are so much more powerful than, e.g., the raspberry pi which is not much cheaper and has a much weaker cpu and ram.
 
I don't have much money but I would pay anyone who manages to get jack to run with an usb interface on a UG802 or similar computer. I'm sure there are others interested in this as well.
 
Looking forward to answers,
Axel
