Hi Axel,

Recent jack2 from git works on armhf (as well as aarm64 and armel).

relevant commits are
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/2f7d512b419cb75cef2e27db872d641de6e7aa0d
and
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/d11bb095291d8880508c87adfe625bf2bcab1456

Which version of jack are you using and on what distribution?

Cheers!
robin
