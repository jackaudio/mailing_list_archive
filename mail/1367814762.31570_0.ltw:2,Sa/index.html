Thats great news about J2 supporting ARM now!

I've just been looking at the Google TV sticks and its pretty crazy the
amount of computing power thats available in such a small form factor for
so little money! I'd be tempted to buy but I've been unable to find one
with a headphone(/mic/AV) jack.

Axel:

Have you found any easily flashed distros complete with the Lima driver
that work on your device? I've heard Q3 is supposed to run well under lima
now.

&gt; Hi Axel,
&gt;
&gt; Recent jack2 from git works on armhf (as well as aarm64 and armel).
&gt;
&gt; relevant commits are
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/2f7d512b419cb75cef2e27db872d641de6e7aa0d
&gt; and
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/d11bb095291d8880508c87adfe625bf2bcab1456
&gt;
&gt; Which version of jack are you using and on what distribution?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers!

&gt; &gt; Hi list,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the guy with the UG802 tv stick again. I've tried to get Jack to run on
&gt; this rk3066 arm hf computer without success for a while now. I posted some
&gt; of the weird error messages on this list but nothing got solved. So, I'd
&gt; like to ask a more general question:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Developers, is anyone working on or even interested in getting Jack to
&gt; run on an arm cortex a9 platform? What are possible problems?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In my opinion, these cheap little sticks and tablets could be a
&gt; wonderful platform for creating audio fx boxes, sound installations etc.
&gt; They are so much more powerful than, e.g., the raspberry pi which is not
&gt; much cheaper and has a much weaker cpu and ram.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't have much money but I would pay anyone who manages to get jack
&gt; to run with an usb interface on a UG802 or similar computer. I'm sure there
&gt; are others interested in this as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to answers,
&gt; &gt; Axel
