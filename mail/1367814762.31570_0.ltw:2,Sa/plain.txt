Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack on arm hf

Thats great news about J2 supporting ARM now!

I've just been looking at the Google TV sticks and its pretty crazy the
amount of computing power thats available in such a small form factor for
so little money! I'd be tempted to buy but I've been unable to find one
with a headphone(/mic/AV) jack.

Axel:

Have you found any easily flashed distros complete with the Lima driver
that work on your device? I've heard Q3 is supposed to run well under lima
now.
