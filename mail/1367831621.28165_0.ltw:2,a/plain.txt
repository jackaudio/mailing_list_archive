I agree wholeheartedly... But this is the status quo.

If clients are well behaved, meaning they finish their processing and go back to the Execute function, Stop will work fine, and provide a clean shutdown, at a point where the client and server are in a consistent state.
If not... I suppose there could be problems. But cancellation should really be a last resort thing, and best avoided in any case. And it can lead to crashes... I suppose this does not matter much, if you are killing the threads just before closing down the client anyway.
