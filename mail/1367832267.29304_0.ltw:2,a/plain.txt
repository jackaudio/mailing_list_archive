Oggetto: Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack thread cancellation

> Quitting from inside a thread is one thing.
> Cancelling a thread from outside using pthread mechanisms is unreliable. It may never hit a cancellation point.

Well, that is why I suppose the ASYNCHRONOUS flag was used. For the processing threads, the chance is it will never call a cancellation point.
However, both the MessageBuffer thread and the SocketClient threads will happyly log messages, and if a cancellation happens at that point, a crash is the likely result.

When we noticed the problem in JackMessageBuffer, we tried to wrap the body of the Execute()  in pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE/ENABLE) (Actually, an RAII pattern), but the same problem is now happening elsewhere.

> Killing a thread is different, though somewhat platform dependent.

Well, thanks for the clarification.
