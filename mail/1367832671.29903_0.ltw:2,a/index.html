&gt; &lt;[hidden]&gt; a &#xE9;crit :&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; Hi list,&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; I have an embedded application that makes use of jack (Version 1.9.8).&#13;
&gt; &gt; I have started seeing crashes from the clients in the JackError() call.&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; The stack trace shows that the thread executing (Which is handling the&#13;
&gt; &gt; JackSocketChannel::Execute call) receives is being killed&#13;
&gt; &gt; (sigcancel_handler is called) and since the thread is in&#13;
&gt; &gt; CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS mode, it crashes since an unsafe function is&#13;
&gt; &gt; called (vnsprintf).&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; The client I am using is actually unaware of using Jack at all, it is&#13;
&gt; &gt; using the alsa jack plugin, and it opens/closes the alsa devices many&#13;
&gt; &gt; times during its lifetime.&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; Now, I have a few doubts:&#13;
&gt; &gt; - Why are threads created with cancellation type&#13;
&gt; PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS?&#13;
&gt; &gt;  Is this because the realtime threads need this or is there some other&#13;
&gt; reason?&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; Old written code&#x2026;. AFAIR PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED was not working so well&#13;
&gt; (or possibly not the same way on test OS like Linux and OSX) so&#13;
&gt; PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS was choses.&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Thanks, that is one og my hypothesis. The other one was that the process callback is likely to have no cancellation point, given the restriction about doing no io.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; &gt; - Would it be possible to mark the threads used by the&#13;
&gt; &gt; JackMessageBuffer and  JackSocketClientChannel as PTHREAD_CANCEL_DELAYED&#13;
&gt; instead?&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; You mean PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED?  Possibly yes.  Try to test it.&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Yes, sorry for the confusion. I am going to test it, I just wanted to make sure I was not missing something important.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; &gt; - Why is fThread.Kill() used in JackSocketClientChannel::Stop instead of&#13;
&gt; fThread.Stop()?&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; Same answer as before, Stop was not working reliably on all testes OSs, so&#13;
&gt; Kill was used.&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&#13;
All right, then I can test it in my setup... I think the environment is controlled enough that using Stop should not have drawbacks.&#13;
&#13;
&gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt;  The latter should still work, and allow the Execute() to terminate it&#13;
&gt; &gt; communication  with the server.&#13;
&gt; &gt;&#13;
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,&#13;
&gt; &gt; Luciano&#13;

Thank you again for the clarification.&#13;
