Have you tried to start JackMessageBuffer thread in PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED mode? Like with the following code in JackMessageBuffer.cpp:

JackMessageBuffer::JackMessageBuffer()
   :fInit(NULL),
   fInitArg(NULL),
   fThread(this, PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED),
   fGuard(),
   fInBuffer(0),
   fOutBuffer(0),
   fOverruns(0),
   fRunning(false)
{}

> When we noticed the problem in JackMessageBuffer, we tried to wrap the body of the Execute()  in pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE/ENABLE) (Actually, an RAII pattern), but the same problem is now happening elsewhere.

Where?

I need to understand better the reason why your application see those problems in the first place. IRC Freenode #jack would be easier.
