Ok, I do have .so files in /usr/lib/jack, but there's no /usr/lib/armhf-linux-gnu dir. Something like that has been my suspicion as well, since I have installed/reinstalled/compiled quite a few times now. Will try a complete system reinstall next week.

jackd will start up seemingly fine when started manually. It has RT privileges.

Sorry, I haven't figured out how to do a gdb backtrace (Linux semi-noob here).

This is the output when I start jack manually:

Hmm, when I quit SC I do have an scsynth running alongside jackd which is still running (no crash) although it previously said "server failed to start". Weird….
