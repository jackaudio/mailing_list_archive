I think I can answer this one.
The "cannot lock down..." messages are due to the use of mlock. You need to be root (or have CAP_IPC_LOCK) to do that.
But even if that call fails, the server should work fine. The memory could be swapped out though.

You can start jackd with a smaller maximum number of ports. The default is much higher than needed in most circumstances.

Try starting jackd with --port-max 256 or something closer to the amount of ports you plan on using.
There is also a #define somewhere to limit the number of ports per client, and that lets you limit the amount of locked down ram a bit more.

Cheers,
Luciano
