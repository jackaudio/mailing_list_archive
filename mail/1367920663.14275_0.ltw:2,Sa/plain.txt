Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack on arm hf

Hi Pat!

I was aware of HDMI -> VGA/audio converters but thats hardly the sleek,
integrated solution I'd prefer. I don't think an integrated headphone jack
is an unrealistic request or expectation here.

I've just been looking at the Picuntu status and it seems to be missing the
Lima driver currently so I think I'll pass until X/GL accel is working on
these things but I'm delighted that someone who had a hand in the Amiga is
interested in our antics! :)
