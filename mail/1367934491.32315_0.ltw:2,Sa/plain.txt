Subject:     [Jack-Devel] R: R: Jack on arm hf

I thought I remembered 768, but maybe that has changed.
Uhm, I think it is actually 2048 (At least, in common/JackConstants.h PORT_NUM is defined to 2048 if not redefined at configuration...
The other value you may try to tweak is the number of ports per client (PORT_NUM_FOR_CLIENTS) but you can change it at build time waf configure:


  --clients=CLIENTS     Maximum number of JACK clients
  --ports-per-application=APPLICATION_PORTS


And it was 200MB, not 2GB, by the way...
