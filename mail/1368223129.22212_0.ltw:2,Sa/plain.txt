Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] R: R: Jack on arm hf

Hi all,

okay, just to make sure my problems don't come from multiple jack installations I completely reinstalled my Picuntu system.

I'd like to ask you to walk me through the process of compiling jack2 to prevent me from making any mistakes.

On this system which is based on Ubuntu 12.10, when I type
dpkg -l | grep jack

I get

ii libjack-jackd2-0:armhf    1.9.8...

I suppose this has to go first. How do I remove this in a clean way?

What compile options do you suggest? As I described earlier I just want to run SuperCollider on the stick. I don't even want a Window manager, so no gui tools.

Thanks a lot in advance,
Axel
