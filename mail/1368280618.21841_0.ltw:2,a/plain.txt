Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Starting out with Jack and Asterisk

Hi,

New to the list so usual apols about addressing questions wrongly etc.

I want to play around with passing Asterisk audio through Jack on Linux. I've successfully installed and configured Jack and Asterisk to talk to eachother, but the documentation for command-line style manipulation is quite light on the ground.

Currently, connecting my call to the JACK() app sends 5 seconds of silence. For my first proof of concept I'd like to get it to send back some sort of sound. This is a server system so there is no GUI etc. Even if it's streaming a sound file that would be fine.

After that I would like to manipulate audio with something like libfaust - wonder if anyone here has experience with that? A simple script to change the pitch of audio would be amazing to see.

Thanks!
Leo
