Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Netjack error: “slave is running with a different protocol”

First off, I've also posted this question to SO, so if anyone's able to
help me, helping
here<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16553899/netjack-error-slave-is-running-with-a-different-protocol>
will
let other people benefit as well :)

 ------------------------------

I'm trying to run jack between two computers. I had this working on a
previous set of systems, but this time around... not so much.

System 1:

tobago$ jackd -R -d alsa -P hw:0 -C hw:1 -p 1024
tobago$ jack_load netadapter

System 2:

trinidad$ jackd -R -d alsa
trinidad$ jack_load netmanager

At this point, jackd starts printing on loop:

Waiting for a slave...
Error : slave is running with a different protocol tobago
Can't init new net master...

Unfortunately googling "slave is running with a different protocol" only
yields two results other than the source code, and neither is helpful. I
checked the version of jackd on each system; one is 1.9.9 with protocol 8,
the other is 1.9.9.5 with protocol 8. So I'm doubtful that's the issue.

Does anyone know why this might be happening?
