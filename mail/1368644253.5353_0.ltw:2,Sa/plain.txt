Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] R: R: Jack on arm hf

Since I haven't gotten any answer I'll make my question more precise:


On my newly installed (headless) system, using dpkg --list I see that I have this installed:

libjack-jackd2-0:armhf    1.9.8

I want to build jackd2 from source and later build SuperCollider to use it exclusively.

1. Do I have to remove the above libjack first (I want to make sure potential later problems don't come from parallel installs)?
2. Once I've done this, what are good compile options to use if I want the most efficient jack install possible? I only need two in and out streams to and from SuperCollider.

Thanks in advance,
Axel

PS: I'm not very fluent in Linux but I'm trying.
