Ha! I've been on and off researching this topic for a couple of months now and I didn't even know this existed. Sorry but another noobiesh question:

My last attempt at compiling jackd2 in early March resulted in a jackdmp 1.9.10

This says : 1.9.9.5+20130306git47f3a68c-1 and others

I need a version that has two arm specific commits from late February/ early March. I'm confused about versions. Is the version in the repository from March 6th?

I'd love to skip the compilation part, if possible.
