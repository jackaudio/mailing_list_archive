Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows dev: error linking libjack64.lib

Hi I found this thread on you Mailing list.
I am one of the Blender developers and maintain the VS2012 platform libs.
It seems that Jack suffers from the same problems blender had befor I began porting some things.
We use jack too and our win64 build crashes, when compiled with jack.
One of the reasons could be these:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/bb531344.aspx

The combination of vs2012 compiles binaries and windows 8 reacts with a runtime error with some initializations from pointers to void*
Or int*

In order to stay compatible the code should be checked for these.
For example 
void *somevar = someClass->someMethod();
Where someMethod is defined as:
int someMethod();
Could cause a runtime error on x64 builds.

I'll take a look at your code in the next weeks and try to find a solution without breaking things.
But I think I'll need some help with that because I am not very familiar with Jack yet.

/Jürgen
