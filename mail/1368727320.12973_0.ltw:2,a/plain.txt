Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack on arm hf

Sorry, more questions.

The experimental build installed okay but when I try to start jackd I get the error:

-----
"unable to autolaunch a dbus-daemon without a $DISPLAY for X11"
----

Yeah, I don't have any window server installed. I want to use the device as a headless audio fx computer. My questions:

1. Is there a way to reconfigure my system (or jack) without compiling myself so jack starts without an X server?
2. If not, and if I install an xfce desktop, how are my chances this would work.

Again, thanks a lot in advance,
Axel
