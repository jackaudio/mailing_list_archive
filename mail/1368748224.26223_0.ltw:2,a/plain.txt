Hi,

maybe it's a routing problem. The interface looks interesting, so I did 
a few google searches and this turned up wrt. the routing:

"I used Gnome Alsamixer in AV Linux and alsamixer in Ubuntu. Both tools 
work similar, so you can use what suits best to you. (Alsamixer is 
command line software, so open your terminal, type alsamixer and press 
enter.

When you have alsamixer opened, you should first choose right soundcard. 
This is done by pressing F6, in command line version, Gnome Alsamixer 
has separate tabs for different soundcards. After that you should see 
about 128 faders. Those control the internal routing.

Now, if you are using Gnome Alsamixer, first thing you should do is 
rename all the 128 faders. (At least I had to, because all faders had 
same names in GUI) This is quite boring job to do, but once you do it, 
Gnome Alsamixer remembers it's settings. If you decide to use alsamixer, 
you don't have to do this.

First 64 faders describe inputs, and last 64 describe outputs. Faders 
are in the groups of eight. (In commandline version of alsamixer you 
have to press F5 to see all 128 faders. By default it shows only input 
faders.) Now you just have to adjust most of the faders to zero (in cli 
alsamixer this is done by pressing end). PageDown and PageUp buttons can 
be used to adjust fader's volume. I adjusted DIn1 - Out1 to 100 and all 
other DIn1 outputs to zero, DIn2 - Out2 to 100 and all other DIn2 
outputs to zero, and so on. The end result was just 8 outputs being 
open: every software return channel was routed to one physical output. Nice!

When you are ready, you should save your mixer settings so that your 
computer remembers them after boot. I did it from the command line by 
running

Code: Select all <http://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=7673#>
    |alsactl -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state store|

as root.

If you are using Ubuntu, running things as root is done via sudo. So the 
right command for you is

Code: Select all <http://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=7673#>
    |sudo alsactl -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state store|



If you don't want to save your settings as root, you can also save them 
to your home folder like this:

Code: Select all <http://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=7673#>
    |alsactl store -f ~/.asoundrc|


And to restore your saved settings:

Code: Select all <http://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=7673#>
    |alsactl restore -f ~/.asoundrc|



This way I got my Fast Track Ultra to work properly. Now I can use 
cueing function in Mixxx and start serious DJ:ing!

Oh, almost forgot: I really haven't tested inputs yet, so I don't know 
if the same method works for them also. I routed them same way: AIn1 - 
Out1 to 100 and other AIn1 outputs to zero, and so on. I'll test it 
someday and update how it works."

Have fun,
Flo
