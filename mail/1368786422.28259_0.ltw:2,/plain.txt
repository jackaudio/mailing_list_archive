Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Too many servers already active

Hi,

At the radio station where I volunteer, we're using 100% open source 
software.  We have a playout system for audio files, where users log in 
one at a time and as part of their session jackd is started, along with 
the newly created audio player 4deckradio.  When they log out, all their 
running programs (including jackd) are killed.

Every now and then, after maybe 15, 20 new logins, jackd refuses to 
start for all users.  The error message is that there are "too many 
servers already active".  However, there are no jackd processes still 
running when I do a "ps aux | grep jack".

A complete restart of the machine remedies the problem, temporarily at 
least.

My hunch is that jackd isn't able to clean up properly sometimes 
(perhaps because it is killed before it has the chance?) causing future 
servers to not start.  I'm at a loss however to figure out -what- 
exactly it doesn't clean up, if that is the case.

Could someone shed some light on what is preventing jackd from starting 
up?  If I know what is preventing jackd from starting, I could remedy it 
with a small workaround/hack maybe.

Kindest regards,
Jan Middelkoop
