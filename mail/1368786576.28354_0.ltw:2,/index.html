There is a shared memory area used to register each jack server. if you
kill the servers, it will not be cleaned up correctly. To clean it you'll
need to use a clean method of shutting jackd down or use system tools such
as shmctl.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; At the radio station where I volunteer, we're using 100% open source
&gt; software.  We have a playout system for audio files, where users log in one
&gt; at a time and as part of their session jackd is started, along with the
&gt; newly created audio player 4deckradio.  When they log out, all their
&gt; running programs (including jackd) are killed.
&gt;
&gt; Every now and then, after maybe 15, 20 new logins, jackd refuses to start
&gt; for all users.  The error message is that there are "too many servers
&gt; already active".  However, there are no jackd processes still running when
&gt; I do a "ps aux | grep jack".
&gt;
&gt; A complete restart of the machine remedies the problem, temporarily at
&gt; least.
&gt;
&gt; My hunch is that jackd isn't able to clean up properly sometimes (perhaps
&gt; because it is killed before it has the chance?) causing future servers to
&gt; not start.  I'm at a loss however to figure out -what- exactly it doesn't
&gt; clean up, if that is the case.
&gt;
&gt; Could someone shed some light on what is preventing jackd from starting
&gt; up?  If I know what is preventing jackd from starting, I could remedy it
&gt; with a small workaround/hack maybe.
&gt;
&gt; Kindest regards,
