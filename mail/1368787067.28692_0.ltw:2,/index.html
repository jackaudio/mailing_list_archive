&gt; There is a shared memory area used to register each jack server. if 
&gt; you kill the servers, it will not be cleaned up correctly. To clean it 
&gt; you'll need to use a clean method of shutting jackd down or use system

&gt;     Hi,
&gt;
&gt;     At the radio station where I volunteer, we're using 100% open
&gt;     source software.  We have a playout system for audio files, where
&gt;     users log in one at a time and as part of their session jackd is
&gt;     started, along with the newly created audio player 4deckradio.
&gt;      When they log out, all their running programs (including jackd)
&gt;     are killed.
&gt;
&gt;     Every now and then, after maybe 15, 20 new logins, jackd refuses
&gt;     to start for all users.  The error message is that there are "too
&gt;     many servers already active".  However, there are no jackd
&gt;     processes still running when I do a "ps aux | grep jack".
&gt;
&gt;     A complete restart of the machine remedies the problem,
&gt;     temporarily at least.
&gt;
&gt;     My hunch is that jackd isn't able to clean up properly sometimes
&gt;     (perhaps because it is killed before it has the chance?) causing
&gt;     future servers to not start.  I'm at a loss however to figure out
&gt;     -what- exactly it doesn't clean up, if that is the case.
&gt;
&gt;     Could someone shed some light on what is preventing jackd from
&gt;     starting up?  If I know what is preventing jackd from starting, I
&gt;     could remedy it with a small workaround/hack maybe.
&gt;
&gt;     Kindest regards,
