Well it seems they are making "some" progress: finally allowing SCHED_FIFO threads for the audio stack, understanding priority inversion issues, how to avoid them..etc

But I still understand that only their audio stack can create SCHED_FIFO threads for their own needs (so still don't see how a JACK like system that needs to create RT threads for clients could be ported then) and they still speak about this crazy 5% CPU budget for all audio stuff.

Hum.. iOS still have some huge advantage here.
