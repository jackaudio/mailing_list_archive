Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER not working

Hi

Encouraged by the report of someone who ran jackd as his default sound
server for non-professional uses (without RT priority as he/she mentioned),
and saying that he (or she) liked the simplicity of jackd, I've tried the
same thing too. But I'm running apps from various user ids, which still
doesn't seem to be supported with jackd, except that it *is* meant to be
supported through the env var JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER. Except that this
doesn't seem to work (anymore? [*]).

This is jackd from the Debian Wheezy package,
1.9.8~dfsg.4+20120529git007cdc37-5

I'm setting umask 0000 for both server and client,
JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER="" (I've also tried other values), but the client
tries to open a different socket path; when I hard link the socket path to
what the client expects, it segfaults.

I'm considering debugging this but I'd appreciate some hints, like, do you
have an idea what broke it (assuming that it's a bug that broke it), or
whatever else I should know about it. Is there a reason I should check out
current head instead of patching the Debian version?

Christian.
