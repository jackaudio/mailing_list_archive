In-Reply-To: Christian Jaeger [Jack-Devel] JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER not working (1369013238.31694_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER not working

I've fixed it by changing the two GetUID methods to return -1 in case the
env var is set. There was a reference to JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER in
common/JackTools.cpp (that wasn't sufficient to get it to work [anymore])
that I've removed now since it's not necessary anymore with the GetUID
change:

 https://github.com/pflanze/jack2/compare/master...fix_promiscous

(Merge the fix_promiscous branch from https://github.com/pflanze/jack2.git)

Maybe one of the two GetUID methods could be eliminated? I haven't looked
whether there is more duplication to eliminate or whether there is a reason
for it.

Now it works as long as umask is 0 for both the server and the client. I'm
going to look into changing that.

(BTW I did add some assert statements to check snprintf result values
https://github.com/pflanze/jack2/compare/fix_promiscous...nonworkingassertbut
strangely one of the asserts failed when exiting the server normally,
so I'm leaving it out of my build now.)

Christian.
