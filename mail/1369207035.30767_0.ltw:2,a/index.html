&gt;&gt; Please Note, I have cc'ed the two main presenters in the video above in
&gt;&gt; case they feel the need to respond and justify their decision making
&gt;&gt; process.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If I was one of them I wouldn't even think of responding to your message.
&gt; While you definetely have some valid points on the purely technical sides
&gt; the overall tone is just too offending and hostile. Given that they even
&gt; have given some details of their own struggles within Google to get at
&gt; least those 5% I don't think you're being fair to Raph Levien and Glenn
&gt; Kastens.
&gt;

They can continue to ignore the issues in the public space and continue to
piss off the greater community with the unresponsiveness and time wasting
or they can give us their official Google sanctioned corporate and legal
verified response.

If they were working for my company and it took 2 years to get to where
they are with the resources at their disposal and the amount of money that
has been spent on their salaries during that time I would be completely
pissed.

The rest of us working under our own steam and with significantly less
backing have managed to find a way to work together and make things happen
so what makes Google so special that they can completely ignore the
technical issues that have been very well identified and discussed
publicly for a number of years.

This is about as bad as Nokia categorically not supporting Android when
Linus Torvalds is Finnish and Nokia is still officially a Finnish company.

If other people want to pussy foot around the topic for fear of offending
someone that is there prerogative. Raph has spent a significant amount of
time working on print and other FLOSS plumbing projects and the lists in
those spaces are as direct as anything I am saying. He should be able to
handle himself in an open discussion even if Greg feels uncomfortable
participating in this arena.

Google make billions of dollars out of open source software developed by a
large number of people who are not getting a cent for their time. The very
least they can do is discuss serious issues like the ones in this thread
in an open space and enable a viable solution for the problems that have
been identified.

However if that is too much effort for someone who is paid a very
reasonable salary to take the time then I suppose that will give us all
the information we need.

If Google consider several companies worth over $100million annual
turnover to be insignificant for their ecosystem then we at least we will
have an official response.

BTW, it is usually accepted that silence in a public space is considered
tacit approval. If you have a different opinion it is up to you to share
it if you want to have any influence of the discussion.
