&gt; For those of us who don't know the history behind this (and who don't
&gt; want to sit through a 40 minute video) what's the underlying problem
&gt; here...?

I've just watched the video. Summary:

   - Android until JellyBean had no SCHED_FIFO in the kernel.

   - Android now uses SCHED_FIFO and CGROUPS with 5% budget for
     low-latency audio while normal audio runs with SCHED_OTHER
     (low-priority). They use the term "fast-path" for low-latency
     access to the audio hardware. Fast-path requires OpenSLES C++ code,
     no Java code.

     The normal audio creates a submix that's fed into the fast-path
     system. That's similar to what you have when running jackd with the
     pulseaudio-jack modules.

   - Android has no means to deal with priority inversion

   - Google developers emphasise not to block in your audio thread
     (surprise, surprise, that's mentioned in the JACK FAQ for years)

   - Sample rates vary among devices (some 44.1kHz, others 48kHz)

   - Hardware buffer sizes vary among devices, e.g., 240 samples/buffer

   - The last two points will be addressed by adding an API to query the
     sample rate and buffer size (Android API level 17)

   - Google hardware team will fix kernel audio driver bugs

The guy who wrote the synthesizer finally talked about optimisations he
had done to his application. Nothing new: Use C++ instead of Java, use
the correct buffer size, use aligned buffers, use SIMD asm.


So after all, there is hope for low-latency on Android. It already works
on some devices, more devices will follow. For the first time, the
architecture is similar to what's known to work on (desktop) Linux.
