&gt;&gt; For those of us who don't know the history behind this (and who don't
&gt;&gt; want to sit through a 40 minute video) what's the underlying problem
&gt;&gt; here...?
&gt; 
&gt; I've just watched the video. Summary:
&gt; 
&gt;   - Android until JellyBean had no SCHED_FIFO in the kernel.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Android now uses SCHED_FIFO and CGROUPS with 5% budget for
&gt;     low-latency audio while normal audio runs with SCHED_OTHER
&gt;     (low-priority). They use the term "fast-path" for low-latency
&gt;     access to the audio hardware. Fast-path requires OpenSLES C++ code,
&gt;     no Java code.
&gt; 
&gt;     The normal audio creates a submix that's fed into the fast-path
&gt;     system. That's similar to what you have when running jackd with the
&gt;     pulseaudio-jack modules.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Android has no means to deal with priority inversion
&gt; 
&gt;   - Google developers emphasise not to block in your audio thread
&gt;     (surprise, surprise, that's mentioned in the JACK FAQ for years)
&gt; 
&gt;   - Sample rates vary among devices (some 44.1kHz, others 48kHz)
&gt; 
&gt;   - Hardware buffer sizes vary among devices, e.g., 240 samples/buffer
&gt; 
&gt;   - The last two points will be addressed by adding an API to query the
&gt;     sample rate and buffer size (Android API level 17)
&gt; 
&gt;   - Google hardware team will fix kernel audio driver bugs
&gt; 
&gt; The guy who wrote the synthesizer finally talked about optimisations he
&gt; had done to his application. Nothing new: Use C++ instead of Java, use
&gt; the correct buffer size, use aligned buffers, use SIMD asm.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So after all, there is hope for low-latency on Android. It already works
&gt; on some devices, more devices will follow. For the first time, the
&gt; architecture is similar to what's known to work on (desktop) Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; HTH

I've understood (perhaps incorrectly) that this SCHED_FIFO mode is *only* possible in *their* code, so that not other code could start threads with SCHED_FIFO. 

SCHED_FIFO is required for the RT thread in JACK server and in each JACK client. And with this overall limitation of 5% budget for    low-latency stuff, we are not going to do anything interesting in the near future...

(BTW : on the completely Apple controlled iOS&#x85; we can still start RT threads (so "time constraints" in OSX/iOS terminology&#x85;) and JACK can start any number of clients, and low-latency audio can use all CPU, and so burn your battery in no time&#x85;.. well if the *user* choose to...)
