In addition they appear to be making decisions about what we can and
cannot do with Linux Audio tools and software without even trying to
canvas the professional Linux Audio community for their feedback on what
would be useful or necessary for our needs.

They seem to want to have a near monopoly on the mobile market but exclude
professional Linux Audio companies from having any input on the
development process.

The whole thing seems like a few people playing with their toys in their
spare time on Googles coin while the rest of us have to sit back and wait
for them to get their ducks in a row. It's been 4 years of waiting and
they are now arguing that they don't even have to worry about the concerns
that the rest of the Linux Audio Development community has identified
including but not limited to running JACK and/or Pulse Audio.

What we have now is a couple of people deciding things on everyone elses
behalf when the parent company that pays their salaries has directly
expressed their support for making Android a flexible platform that anyone
can work with*.
