I'd have to say I agree with Ralf here.  What Google is saying is that 
whilst they want to position Android as a flexible OS that anyone can 
work with, that doesn't necessarily mean developing it for high power 
multimedia use (or for that matter, laboratory use / mission critical 
usage or any other specialized usage).  As Ralf went on to say, they're 
positioning Android as an OS for tablets and other hand-held devices.  
If users start demanding powerful multimedia apps for Android (or 
Android starts losing sales to iOS) things will no doubt change.
