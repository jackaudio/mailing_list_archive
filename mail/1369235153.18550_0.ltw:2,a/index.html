&gt; I'd have to say I agree with Ralf here.  What Google is saying is that
&gt; whilst they want to position Android as a flexible OS that anyone can work
&gt; with, that doesn't necessarily mean developing it for high power multimedia
&gt; use (or for that matter, laboratory use / mission critical usage or any
&gt; other specialized usage).  As Ralf went on to say, they're positioning
&gt; Android as an OS for tablets and other hand-held devices.  If users start
&gt; demanding powerful multimedia apps for Android (or Android starts losing
&gt; sales to iOS) things will no doubt change.


Indeed. Although, from my view in the peanut gallery, it seems that the
needs or the pro- and consumer-audio crowds are not really at odds with
each other. Apple has always supported both very well with their CoreAudio
system, which offers low-latency/real-time operation for clients that need
it, but is flexible enough that anyone and his web browser can just start
outputting audio without worrying too much. iOS indeed does support both
types of use-case (and with the recent USB audio class support from vendors
such as RME, specifically to work with iPads, this appears to be being
taken up by reasonably powerful recording apps).

I guess it just seems like a shame that while a properly-designed audio
system intrinsically provides all the functionality that everyone needs,
the pro-audio people are being ignored in Android development anyway.
