Indeed. Although, from my view in the peanut gallery, it seems that the
needs or the pro- and consumer-audio crowds are not really at odds with
each other. Apple has always supported both very well with their CoreAudio
system, which offers low-latency/real-time operation for clients that need
it, but is flexible enough that anyone and his web browser can just start
outputting audio without worrying too much. iOS indeed does support both
types of use-case (and with the recent USB audio class support from vendors
such as RME, specifically to work with iPads, this appears to be being
taken up by reasonably powerful recording apps).

I guess it just seems like a shame that while a properly-designed audio
system intrinsically provides all the functionality that everyone needs,
the pro-audio people are being ignored in Android development anyway.
