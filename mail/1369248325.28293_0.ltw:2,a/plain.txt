Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK on Android: Use cases?

All this talk about Google and Android has me thinking: if we could run 
JACK on our phones / tablets, what would that get us? I can't think of 
any use cases. But, my imagination is limited, and I want to know what 
the rest of you think.

What I would love is to be able to use my phone / tablet to control my 
mixer or Ardour remotely. That wouldn't require JACK though, just a 
decent interface and OSC. I think something like that already exists anyway.

I look forward to your comments with great delight.

Yours,

David Nielson
