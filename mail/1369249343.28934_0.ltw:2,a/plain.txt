Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JackIOS Sourcecode not available

Hi jack-devel.

I guess jacks license was changed.

- The jack2 git repo doesnt even carry a license file
- JackIOS was released in binary form, but the sourcecode has not.

The license change, i agreed to, only allows static linking to <some URL>
In order to push somthing to this URL, the sourcecode must be released.
<some URL> does not even seem to be specified.

On April 3rd Jonathan Liles asked Christian for the jack iOS sourcecode.
He just ignored the request for the sourcecode and only said, that Stephane 
would merge the API in Question.

Nothing seems to have happened so far !
I want to see this resolved before the weekend.
