Patrick, I'm surprised at you.  Google is making a decision on its own 
behalf as it has every right to do.  Their decision is certainly 
short-sighted but it's the nature of open source development that, once 
you release your source code, you end up with very, very, very, very, 
VERY few rights.  You certainly don't have the right to insist that 
future recipients must retain features which (perhaps) they feel are 
making the software bloated.  Nor do you have the right to insist that a 
recipient's priorities for the source code must be the same as yours.

A day will undoubtedly come when Google will need to start taking 
pro-audio seriously - so it doesn't make much sense for them to be 
pissing off a whole bunch of people whose expertise they're eventually 
going to need.  Nevertheless, they have every right to behave like 
jackasses if that's what they want.

John
