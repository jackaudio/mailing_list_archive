Global warning and CO2 is the tree that hide the forest of all the other
countless pollution sources. The key is our relationship with nature,
which determines all other forms or human relationships. And no
technology, and certainly not a patented one, can replace nature. Take
the new technologies, at a global level, they just add new pollution
sources to the old ones.

For capitalism, this relationship is an exploitation. For marxism,
it is a fight. Both are equally wrong on that essential point,
because no human society will survive on the long run when its
relationship with nature is not based on respect.

Respect is also the essential condition for solidarity. Which doesn't
mean to be naive, but just mean to be smart enough to discuss and
reach a common agreement that can satisfy each and every body. Respect
is democracy for the peoples by the peoples, and is possible only with
the consciousness that earth is our only source of life and that no
technology can replace it.

Revolution Mean Revolutionary Consciousness (Sture Johannesson), not
marxism, capitalism or whateverism.
