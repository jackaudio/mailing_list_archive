&gt; That's what I said in the other thread too. Assumed an iPad or Android
&gt; tablet PC would be more solid, then it would be useful to replace other
&gt; portable audio gear. One of my DAT recorders is a portable device, as
&gt; for all of my DAT recorders the mechanics is broken. A Smartphone or
&gt; tablet PC could be build without such weak points, unfortunately they
&gt; are build with weak points. A predetermined breaking point are the
&gt; switches and at least the iPads, that can be used with jack and that
&gt; already for free do provide audio workstations, you could use while
&gt; traveling, does suffer from it's batteries. So for everyday audio studio
&gt; work, much less for stage, they are not solid enough and you would need
&gt; to connect them to a power supply.

Here's the guy who wants to use his Android stick as a guitar/vocal fx machine, freely programmable through in my case Supercollider.

That would mean:

I would not need a guitar fx board anymore. Not ever anymore!
I could go places where regular audio fx designers don't go because the results might not sound "impressing" in a conventional commercial sense.
I could freely express myself through technology (wasn't that one of the foundational ideas of the free software movement?)

As for the "smartphones and tablets are not build for professional use" argument:

People do use them professionally! Just as they always have with stuff that was deemed toys by others or "consumer computers" by certain marketing people. Also, an Android computer doesn't have to be a phone or a tablet. Those Android sticks are so much more suited for on stage and studio use than conventional laptops with all those parts that can break. Has anyone ever built a laptop computer that was truly built for on stage use?

That's just my use case.

I can imagine many many others.

I can imagine a whole music-technological movement once a platform is created that works very similar to ios without that crippling of the connectivity which Apple marketing decided on to ensure control over what people do with their devices, i.e. mainly consume Apple provided media content.

Just a lowly guitar player's and hobby programmer's 2 euro cents

Kind regards,
Axel
