Hi,

It's quite annoying to read all this political agitation and IMHO jack-devel list is not a place for this.

We have few issues even on x86 (most important for me now is multilib  problem in Jack2). It's sad because this thread disturb our dear Jack core developers , I'm worried about this ;(

&gt; That's your choice. I've got FX gear that is &gt;= 30 years old, was used
&gt; on stage and never gets broken and I own modern FX gear that was only
&gt; used in the studio and gets broken after 3 years. IMO even this modern
&gt; FX equipment I bought is more solid than a tablet PC. This are my
&gt; experiences with my own equipment, I carefully maintained it. I also
&gt; worked professional for audio and there I've seen people who where not
&gt; very careful. It wasn't their own equipment and they sometimes even were
&gt; to stupid to roll up a cable. I suspect that a lot of tablet PC won't
&gt; survive 1 day of professional usage.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm aware of the possibilities an Android tablet would provide and I
&gt; would like to get one myself, but I don't expect this gear to be
&gt; durable.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you want to keep this in mind:

&gt; 
&gt; We, you and me, are responsible for this!
&gt; 
&gt; For me the question about rt-audio abilities is interesting too, but I
&gt; try not to forget about the whole story.
&gt; 
&gt; Are those consumer tablet PC vendors evil, when they make marketing
&gt; decisions about pro-audio? Perhaps, perhaps not.
&gt; 
&gt; What about all this waste?
