Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK on Android: Use cases?

Hi,

It's quite annoying to read all this political agitation and IMHO jack-devel list is not a place for this.

We have few issues even on x86 (most important for me now is multilib  problem in Jack2). It's sad because this thread disturb our dear Jack core developers , I'm worried about this ;(

P.
