Well, somebody asked for use cases and I did provide one.

What about all this waste? Well, that's another question and I have concerns about it that are probably very similar to yours, but I believe this doesn't belong in this thread.

I'd just like to repeat that very small and powerful computers with real time audio capabilities and without Apples hard- and software restrictions could open very many possibilities for many people in the pro/amateur/whatever audio world.

What about the Ubuntu phone platform? Have any Jack developers gotten into that already?

Cheers,
Axel

&gt; That's your choice. I've got FX gear that is &gt;= 30 years old, was used

&gt; used in the studio and gets broken after 3 years. IMO even this modern
&gt; FX equipment I bought is more solid than a tablet PC. This are my
&gt; experiences with my own equipment, I carefully maintained it. I also
&gt; worked professional for audio and there I've seen people who where not
&gt; very careful. It wasn't their own equipment and they sometimes even were
&gt; to stupid to roll up a cable. I suspect that a lot of tablet PC won't
&gt; survive 1 day of professional usage.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm aware of the possibilities an Android tablet would provide and I
&gt; would like to get one myself, but I don't expect this gear to be
&gt; durable.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you want to keep this in mind:

&gt; 
&gt; We, you and me, are responsible for this!
&gt; 
&gt; For me the question about rt-audio abilities is interesting too, but I
&gt; try not to forget about the whole story.
&gt; 
&gt; Are those consumer tablet PC vendors evil, when they make marketing
&gt; decisions about pro-audio? Perhaps, perhaps not.
&gt; 
&gt; What about all this waste?
