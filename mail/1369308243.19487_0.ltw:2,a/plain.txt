Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK on Android: Use cases?

Well, somebody asked for use cases and I did provide one.

What about all this waste? Well, that's another question and I have concerns about it that are probably very similar to yours, but I believe this doesn't belong in this thread.

I'd just like to repeat that very small and powerful computers with real time audio capabilities and without Apples hard- and software restrictions could open very many possibilities for many people in the pro/amateur/whatever audio world.

What about the Ubuntu phone platform? Have any Jack developers gotten into that already?

Cheers,
Axel
