What is there to do?

Ubuntu runs on Unity and supports gstreamer so the only issue is if the
Ubuntu developers have decided to purposefully disable JACK support in
gstreamer.

There's nothing to suggest that is the case at this stage.

We know that the current version of PA on Tizen does not have JACK sink
support but that should be fixed soon as the PA Tizen devs are actively
working on the issue.

So, the only problem is Google's attitude towards professional audio and
JACK support.

JACK runs on the raspberry pi. It's not like it requires a lot of
resources. Just realtime capabilities to meet the demands of professional
users.
