&gt; What rationale can they possibly have that makes it seem like a logical

Maybe that people who want to run low latency audio applications on their
phones are an incredibly small percentage of the total market.  And that
low latency applications have a detrimental impact on power consumption,
which decreases battery life, which is very important to a very large
percentage of the target market.

&gt; Are they aware that they are getting close to a class action anti trust
&gt; law suit

Ridiculous is the only polite term I can think of.  How can you have an
anti-trust lawsuit over an open source operating system?

If there was such a demand for low latency audio applications on Android
then certainly one of the OEM's could fork Android and provide a version
with low latency extensions enabled.

For that matter you could as well.  Get to work on it, I'm sure the
Cyanogen mod guys won't mind hosting.
