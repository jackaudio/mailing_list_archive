Thanx, Panos, a lot!
Results of tests are very good!) There was realy unregistered DLL-file in a system.
I have registered manualy the 64bit Jack DLL, and it just worked!
Have never used ReaRouteAsio in Reaper. But it also would be interesting to test it.)

About using Reaper - your right! I meaned "free download" = "accessible download", not FREE for USE :)

> It works fine at Win7 64bit
> I usualy use last version of JackAudio (mixed 32/64bit mode) server for connection (DAW) Cockos "Reaper" 32bit with other audio aplications. And it works!
> But.. it does not work with "Reaper" 64bit (all versions) at Win7 64bit. The DAW doesn't see JackAudio in ASIO LIST, so it is impossible to connect it with JackAudio.
> May i ask you to look, what is problem there? And could you help with it?
> "Reaper" is free for download, and it doesn't lose functionality after trial period of 1 month, and is usble for all next time. So, it is easy to test it in working with JackAudio.
> official website is: http://reaper.fm/
> link for download Reaper 64bit: http://reaper.fm/download.php

> I hope for your help. I'll wait for your response.
