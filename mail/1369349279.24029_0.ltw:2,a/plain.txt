Ill-advisedly jumping into the middle of this discussion: I'm aware of
quite a lot of guitar oriented apps for iPhone, such as IK Multmedia's
Amplitube. People do use these, for convenience and the low additional
cost (obviously the device itself is fairly expensive, but compared to
pro audio gear not so bad). There are very few (when I checked last
year basically none) for android, supposedly because the audio
framework is not up to it.
