HEY Vasyl ! 
I'm glad !
Yep, I realised that you ment free download after I posted the e-mail LOL
&#xA0;
The difference I found with ReaRoute is that Jack connects all audio of my apps between them in any combination, though Rearoute has always as&#xA0;base Reaper and also cannot mix 32bit with 64bit apps, as for example with jack can have here EWQL orch x64(Free) with sampleTank x86 (free) in standalone mode.
And to be fair, Reaper has the same ability with bridging if one uses the VST mode AND Jack is total free.
&#xA0;
Also I have found that Jack behaves better than ReaRoute when using apps that cannot be VST, only standalone. There Jack delivers me a quality crack free sound whereas ReaRoute needs higher buffer number to reach the same quality (Jack at 128, Rearoute at 384), most probably has to do with my OS, or maybe not, cannot verify this yet, but the above mesurements above are correct. Asio4all driver on both cases.
&#xA0;
Best
Panos

Thanx, Panos, a lot!
Results of tests are very good!) There was realy unregistered DLL-file in a system.
I have registered manualy the 64bit Jack DLL, and it just worked!
Have never used ReaRouteAsio in Reaper. But it also would be interesting to test it.)

About using Reaper - your right! I meaned "free download" = "accessible download", not FREE for USE :)

&gt; Hi Vasyl,
&gt;
&gt; I'm using both Jack and Reaper for four years now. I never had problems.
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm on win 7 x64, Jack 1.9.9.5 latest build (32/64) where I manualy registered the 64bit jack.dll on windows system 32 from the first build of both 32 and 64bit jack for windows Stephane offered so kindly to us. then&#xA0;every update I'm doin no need to re-register.
&gt;
&gt; Reaper 451rc1 x64 which by the way is NOT FREEWARE, simply Cockos have the poclicy of not closing it after the 60 days trial and it just asks you to buy it please for some sec. :-)
&gt; I did because I like what it offers for just 27euros where CuBase here is more than 600....
&gt; Also is the best DAW worldwide today IMVHO
&gt;
&gt; I have no issue Reaper seeing jackrouter. I just checked just before reply here. It's there and ready to use.
&gt;
&gt; Tips :
&gt; 1.did you registered manualy the 64bit jack dll with command prompt ?
&gt; 2.You must first open Jackrouter and then Reaper &gt; Preferences&gt;Audio it's there waiting.
&gt;
&gt; Indeed the possibilities with jack and Reaper are countless, but there are people using the ReaRouteAsio as well (like me, having all three at hand&#xA0;LOL)
&gt;
&gt; Take another test and post back please
&gt; Best
&gt; Panos

&gt;
&gt; Dear developers!
&gt; I use jack audio for 8 month, and i am very glad for this aplication!
&gt; It works fine at Win7 64bit
&gt; I usualy use last version of JackAudio (mixed 32/64bit mode) server for connection (DAW) Cockos "Reaper" 32bit with other audio aplications. And it works!
&gt; But.. it does not work with "Reaper" 64bit (all versions) at Win7 64bit. The DAW doesn't see JackAudio in ASIO LIST, so it is impossible to connect it with JackAudio.
&gt; May i ask you to look, what is problem there? And could you help with it?
&gt; "Reaper" is free for download, and it doesn't lose functionality after trial period of 1 month, and is usble for all next time. So, it is easy to test it in working with JackAudio.
&gt; official website is: http://reaper.fm/
&gt; link for download Reaper 64bit: http://reaper.fm/download.php
&gt;
&gt; I hope for your help. I'll wait for your response.
