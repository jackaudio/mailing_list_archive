HEY Vasyl ! 
I'm glad !
Yep, I realised that you ment free download after I posted the e-mail LOL
 
The difference I found with ReaRoute is that Jack connects all audio of my apps between them in any combination, though Rearoute has always as base Reaper and also cannot mix 32bit with 64bit apps, as for example with jack can have here EWQL orch x64(Free) with sampleTank x86 (free) in standalone mode.
And to be fair, Reaper has the same ability with bridging if one uses the VST mode AND Jack is total free.
 
Also I have found that Jack behaves better than ReaRoute when using apps that cannot be VST, only standalone. There Jack delivers me a quality crack free sound whereas ReaRoute needs higher buffer number to reach the same quality (Jack at 128, Rearoute at 384), most probably has to do with my OS, or maybe not, cannot verify this yet, but the above mesurements above are correct. Asio4all driver on both cases.
 
Best
Panos

Thanx, Panos, a lot!
Results of tests are very good!) There was realy unregistered DLL-file in a system.
I have registered manualy the 64bit Jack DLL, and it just worked!
Have never used ReaRouteAsio in Reaper. But it also would be interesting to test it.)

About using Reaper - your right! I meaned "free download" = "accessible download", not FREE for USE :)
