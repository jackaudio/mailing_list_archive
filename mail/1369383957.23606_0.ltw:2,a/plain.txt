Subject:     [Jack-Devel] R: JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER not working

I can help here...
I had the same problem, and have a couple of patches around.

The attached patches remove the uid from the socket and semaphore names. This fixes jackd in promiscuous mode in my setup.

you will probably need to strip a few prefixes from the patches, since in my repo jack is one of several packages, but that's about it.

These are against jackd2 1.9.8, but they should still apply fine.

I was going to submit these changes as soon as I got to review the new jack version, but if there are other users needing it, I am more than happy to help.

Cheers,
Luciano
