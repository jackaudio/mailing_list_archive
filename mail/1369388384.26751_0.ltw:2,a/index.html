&gt; Maybe that people who want to run low latency audio applications on their
&gt; phones are an incredibly small percentage of the total market.  And that
&gt; low latency applications have a detrimental impact on power consumption,
&gt; which decreases battery life, which is very important to a very large
&gt; percentage of the target market.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are they aware that they are getting close to a class action anti trust
&gt;&gt; law suit
&gt;
&gt; Ridiculous is the only polite term I can think of.  How can you have an
&gt; anti-trust lawsuit over an open source operating system?
&gt;

Google's version of Android is not 100% open. They make decisions about
it's direction and don't consult with the wider community. They have been
unable to deliver the flexibility for us to run JACK, PA, Gstreamer, or
any other audio tools for 4 years. The market is consistently growing but
they have excluded professional audio manufacturers and developers from
the market. As they have a near monopoly on the global market they are
verging on anti competitive behaviour. That is anti trust. It's got
nothing to do with open source.


&gt; If there was such a demand for low latency audio applications on Android
&gt; then certainly one of the OEM's could fork Android and provide a version
&gt; with low latency extensions enabled.
&gt;
&gt; For that matter you could as well.  Get to work on it, I'm sure the
&gt; Cyanogen mod guys won't mind hosting.
&gt;

You're missing the point. How many people are going to install
cyanogen-mod to use low latency audio? That is not a business model for
professional audio manufacturers and developers.

You seem to think that there is no market for professional audio on the
Android platform. If that is the case then it would be the same on iOS
too. Clearly it is not so you must be wrong in that assumption.
