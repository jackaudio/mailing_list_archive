Google's version of Android is not 100% open. They make decisions about
it's direction and don't consult with the wider community. They have been
unable to deliver the flexibility for us to run JACK, PA, Gstreamer, or
any other audio tools for 4 years. The market is consistently growing but
they have excluded professional audio manufacturers and developers from
the market. As they have a near monopoly on the global market they are
verging on anti competitive behaviour. That is anti trust. It's got
nothing to do with open source.

You're missing the point. How many people are going to install
cyanogen-mod to use low latency audio? That is not a business model for
professional audio manufacturers and developers.

You seem to think that there is no market for professional audio on the
Android platform. If that is the case then it would be the same on iOS
too. Clearly it is not so you must be wrong in that assumption.
