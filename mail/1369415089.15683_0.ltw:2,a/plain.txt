Most of the source-files do have license & copyright indication, but
indeed it's a mess.

For cleaning things up, this can be helpful:

http://ftp-master.metadata.debian.org/changelogs/main/j/jackd2/jackd2_1.9.9.5+20130306git47f3a68c-1_copyright

Note however that these are just the explicit copyright holders &
licenses. In most countries one cannot reassign copyright.
