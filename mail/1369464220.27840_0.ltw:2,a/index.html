&gt;&gt; Google's version of Android is not 100% open. They make decisions about
&gt;&gt; it's direction and don't consult with the wider community. They have
&gt;&gt; been
&gt;&gt; unable to deliver the flexibility for us to run JACK, PA, Gstreamer, or
&gt;&gt; any other audio tools for 4 years. The market is consistently growing
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; they have excluded professional audio manufacturers and developers from
&gt;&gt; the market. As they have a near monopoly on the global market they are
&gt;&gt; verging on anti competitive behaviour. That is anti trust.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is hilarious.
&gt;

Maybe to you but I would like to know what some of the official
organisations have to say about it. I wonder if for example the French
Government would be interested in it as part of their cultural protection
program against the barrage of Foreign (ie US) influence. We know they
just love to take Google to court.

It may sound hilarious but if any law suit is established Google will have
to spend more in legal fees just to close a frivolous case let alone one
with actual merit than they would fixing the f***ing problem.

Hopefully it won't get to that point and they will just sort it it out
sooner rather than later.

We have already patiently waited for more than 4 years for them to get
their s**t together while they have excluded LAD and professional audio
from the Android platform the whole time resulting in the loss of
potential income for a large number of companies during that time period.

If you think that it is acceptable for Google to continue excluding
professional audio from the android platform then you don't need to
concern yourself with any potential law suits either.

Anyway, I think the first step will be a petition from the wider community
prominently publicised on various technology websites. Pointing out how
moronic they to the general public should get the attention of the people
who are making the decisions not to prioritise the solutions that are
needed.

If they don't respond to that then it will be to the courts.

Who knows we might weven make some serious cash out of it if it is
determined that we have a valid case. It would be payback for all the
money Google, Samsung and others make out of ALSA.
