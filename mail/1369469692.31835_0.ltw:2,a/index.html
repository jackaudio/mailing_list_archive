&gt; The market is consistently growing but [Google]
&gt; have excluded professional audio manufacturers and developers from
&gt; the market. As they have a near monopoly on the global market they are
&gt; verging on anti competitive behaviour.

&gt; I would like to know what some of the official

&gt; just love to take Google to court.

&gt; We have already patiently waited for more than 4 years for them to get
&gt; their s**t together while they have excluded LAD and professional audio
&gt; from the Android platform the whole time resulting in the loss of
&gt; potential income for a large number of companies during that time period.

What on earth are you talking about Patrick??  Google's only crime in 
all this is to piss you off (and maybe a bunch of other LADs too - but 
either way, that's NOT illegal).  If Google had done something to 
prevent Apple from implementing pro-audio features, THAT would be 
anti-competitive behaviour.  But if Google makes decisions which 
ultimately harm its own products, that's not anti-competitive, it's just 
dumb.  If people could be convicted for making stupid decisions we'd all 
have been banged up in jail at some point in our lives!!

You may find it unpalatable but the recipient of open source software is 
pretty much free to use it in any way they like.  As long as they abide 
by the terms of the license they absolutely DON'T have to develop it to 
suit anybody else's agenda.  If you believe they've breached the terms 
of their license, please explain how.

&gt; If you think that it is acceptable for Google to continue excluding
&gt; professional audio from the android platform then you don't need to
&gt; concern yourself with any potential law suits either.
That's the most sensible thing you've said so far!
