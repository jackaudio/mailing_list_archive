&gt; If you think that it is acceptable for Google to continue excluding
&gt; professional audio from the android platform then you don't need to
&gt; concern yourself with any potential law suits either.
&gt;


It's absolutely acceptable for Google to make Android an operating system
not suitable for professional audio applications. Just like it's OK for
every manufacturer of Linux routers to make routers not suitable for
professional audio.



&gt; If they don't respond to that then it will be to the courts.
&gt;

 There is no case.

Let's get back to your previous mail:

&gt; The market is consistently growing but
&gt; they have excluded professional audio manufacturers and developers from
&gt; the market. As they have a near monopoly on the global market they are
&gt; verging on anti competitive behaviour. That is anti trust.

First, the only market relevant for a potential antitrust case would be the
hypothetic "Professional audio on Android devices" market.
This market does not exist, yet. There even isn't any competition on that
market since the market doesn't exist.

Second, every potential competitor on this not yet existing market is
treated exactly the same. They all can't do professional audio on Android
devices. That's completely fair competition.

Once again, there is no antitrust case!


Finally, one thing that got almost forgotten in this discussion is that
there will not be professional audio on Android unless Android devices
support USB audio interfaces. See how more and more new audio interfaces
have a standards compliant mode? That's how audio interface manufacturers
create a professional audio market on iOS. And it will be those
manufacturers and their devices that will pave the way for professional
audio on Android.

BTW, right now Google focuses on output latency. That's what even important
without external audio interfaces. It's what much more players on the
Android software market need. It's needed in games and even for casual
music instruments etc. Hopefully they don't completely ignore the other
aspects.

I'm still quite sure that we will see Jack on Android - within the next 15
years :-)

Regards,

Felix
