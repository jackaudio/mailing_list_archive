You are missing the point. It's not about licensing.

It's about Google purposefully excluding professional audio developers and
companies from the Android platform.

That is not about Google loosing money. It is about them stopping us from
making money off the Android platform.

As a rough estimate we can say they have denied the professional Audio and
Linux Audio Development community the potential of earning > $50milion
over the past 4 years.

Who knows what the actual sum might have been. In that case it is anti
competitive behaviour and those kinds of numbers tend to get the attention
of the Anti Trust Lawyers.
