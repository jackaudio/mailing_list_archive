&gt;&gt; If you think that it is acceptable for Google to continue excluding
&gt;&gt; professional audio from the android platform then you don't need to
&gt;&gt; concern yourself with any potential law suits either.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It's absolutely acceptable for Google to make Android an operating system
&gt; not suitable for professional audio applications. Just like it's OK for
&gt; every manufacturer of Linux routers to make routers not suitable for
&gt; professional audio.
&gt;

If that was the case it would also be acceptable for M$ to make IE the
default browser at the exclusion of other browsers. In this case Audio
Flinger is the default audio system on Android and we can't even run the
other audio systems if we would like to.

That is anti competitive behaviour.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If they don't respond to that then it will be to the courts.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  There is no case.
&gt;
&gt; Let's get back to your previous mail:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 2013/5/24 Patrick Shirkey &lt;[hidden]&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The market is consistently growing but
&gt;&gt; they have excluded professional audio manufacturers and developers from
&gt;&gt; the market. As they have a near monopoly on the global market they are
&gt;&gt; verging on anti competitive behaviour. That is anti trust.
&gt;
&gt; First, the only market relevant for a potential antitrust case would be
&gt; the
&gt; hypothetic "Professional audio on Android devices" market.
&gt; This market does not exist, yet. There even isn't any competition on that
&gt; market since the market doesn't exist.
&gt;
&gt; Second, every potential competitor on this not yet existing market is
&gt; treated exactly the same. They all can't do professional audio on Android
&gt; devices. That's completely fair competition.
&gt;
&gt; Once again, there is no antitrust case!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Finally, one thing that got almost forgotten in this discussion is that
&gt; there will not be professional audio on Android unless Android devices
&gt; support USB audio interfaces. See how more and more new audio interfaces
&gt; have a standards compliant mode? That's how audio interface manufacturers
&gt; create a professional audio market on iOS. And it will be those
&gt; manufacturers and their devices that will pave the way for professional
&gt; audio on Android.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, right now Google focuses on output latency. That's what even
&gt; important
&gt; without external audio interfaces. It's what much more players on the
&gt; Android software market need. It's needed in games and even for casual
&gt; music instruments etc. Hopefully they don't completely ignore the other
&gt; aspects.
&gt;
&gt; I'm still quite sure that we will see Jack on Android - within the next 15
&gt; years :-)
&gt;

That's a lot of potential earnings that we are being excluded from. A huge
amount of money for any lawyer to salivate over.
