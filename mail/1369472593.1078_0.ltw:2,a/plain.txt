Not at all, Patrick.  It's you that's missing the point.  I have a 
friend who writes software for tuning rally cars.  It's a much bigger 
market than you might imagine, it's very expensive software and there's 
a lot of money involved - but I doubt that his software will run on 
Android.  Does that entitle him to sue Google?  Or what about all the 
Android users in the world.  Can they all sue my friend because they 
bought a platform that won't run his software?

There is no legal precedent that all software must run on all 
platforms.  Nor is there any legal precedent obliging platform owners to 
include pro-audio features or any other features. Platform owners sink 
or swim, according to the commercial decisions they make - but their 
investors and their customers will ultimately decide their fate.  The 
Linux Audio community has no authority in the matter.
