Subject:     [Jack-Devel] list current (ALSA) device

AFAIK there is no way to discover or display the device currently used by
J1 or J2. This has bugged me for years so its surprising its took me so
long to raise this on here, which I thought best to do before I file a
feature request as maybe there is some obscure reason why this may not be
possible?

Current, under J2, it seems you can only display the currently used driver
but not the device used by that driver. I want to see what device I'm using
right above the xrun display and other critical info within qjack and
Cadence but that won't be possible until JACK supports it!
