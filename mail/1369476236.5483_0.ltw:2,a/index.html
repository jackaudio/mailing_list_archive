&gt;&gt; That is not about Google loosing money. It is about them stopping us

&gt;&gt; making money off the Android platform.
&gt;
&gt; Not at all, Patrick.  It's you that's missing the point.  I have a
&gt; friend who writes software for tuning rally cars.  It's a much bigger
&gt; market than you might imagine, it's very expensive software and there's
&gt; a lot of money involved - but I doubt that his software will run on
&gt; Android.  Does that entitle him to sue Google?  Or what about all the
&gt; Android users in the world.  Can they all sue my friend because they
&gt; bought a platform that won't run his software?
&gt;
&gt; There is no legal precedent that all software must run on all
&gt; platforms.  Nor is there any legal precedent obliging platform owners to
&gt; include pro-audio features or any other features. Platform owners sink
&gt; or swim, according to the commercial decisions they make - but their
&gt; investors and their customers will ultimately decide their fate.  The
&gt; Linux Audio community has no authority in the matter.
&gt;

Let me once again explain because all the responses I have had so far are
completely missing the point.

1: Android is the most widely distributed Operating System on the planet
with a near monopoly on the mobile device market approaching 80% of all
devices sold.
3: They are purposefully excluding professional audio in particular LAD
from running the sound servers that we have developed and choose to work
with.

That is anti competitive behaviour which could be valid all the way up to
the EU Anti Trust Commission.

Those of us who are actively developing and manufacturing and making a
real business out of Linux Audio development could have been selling our
products on the Android platform for the past 4 years and earning money
from the sales however due to Googles decision making process we have been
excluded from that not because it is not technically possible to run our
software on the platform but because they have decided we are not allowed
to do so.

The amount of revenue that has been lost to the global professional audio
industry because of Googles inability or willingness to solve the issues
preventing professional audio on the Android platform is not an
insignificant amount. It could be calculated well into the billions based
on the number of people that are using Android devices.

IMO taking them to court is a last resort but if they fail to take
appropriate steps to fully address the issues that have been raised
multiple times in varying ways either through direct communication or on
the multiple internationally accessible open source mailing lists where
their own developers are actively participating or invited to participate
in discussions then it might be the only option to force their hand.

If it is not painfully obvious I don't care what Ralph Maldorf has to say
on any matter concerning Linux Audio Development.

As other people have attempted to shoot down the points I am making I have
continued the discussion.The topic is a serious business topic which
directly involves the software/developers and companies targeting the 
JACK infrastructure and ecosystem.

It could be argued that the slow down in traffic for discussions on this
mailing list regarding JACK on  PC/desktop can be directly attributed to
the growth of Android as an OS/platform and the subsequent lack of
interest in PC based software and tools but that is another topic for
discussion in ANOTHER location.
