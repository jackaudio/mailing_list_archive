Just two quick question Pat, please!

1 - Are you a lawyer? I'm not.

2 - If the answer to 1 is no, have you spoken to one about your issue with
Google?

Thank you!

&gt; &gt;&gt; It's about Google purposefully excluding professional audio developers
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; companies from the Android platform.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; That is not about Google loosing money. It is about them stopping us
&gt; &gt;&gt; from
&gt; &gt;&gt; making money off the Android platform.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not at all, Patrick.  It's you that's missing the point.  I have a
&gt; &gt; friend who writes software for tuning rally cars.  It's a much bigger
&gt; &gt; market than you might imagine, it's very expensive software and there's
&gt; &gt; a lot of money involved - but I doubt that his software will run on
&gt; &gt; Android.  Does that entitle him to sue Google?  Or what about all the
&gt; &gt; Android users in the world.  Can they all sue my friend because they
&gt; &gt; bought a platform that won't run his software?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is no legal precedent that all software must run on all
&gt; &gt; platforms.  Nor is there any legal precedent obliging platform owners to
&gt; &gt; include pro-audio features or any other features. Platform owners sink
&gt; &gt; or swim, according to the commercial decisions they make - but their
&gt; &gt; investors and their customers will ultimately decide their fate.  The
&gt; &gt; Linux Audio community has no authority in the matter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Let me once again explain because all the responses I have had so far are
&gt; completely missing the point.
&gt;
&gt; 1: Android is the most widely distributed Operating System on the planet
&gt; with a near monopoly on the mobile device market approaching 80% of all
&gt; devices sold.
&gt; 3: They are purposefully excluding professional audio in particular LAD
&gt; from running the sound servers that we have developed and choose to work
&gt; with.
&gt;
&gt; That is anti competitive behaviour which could be valid all the way up to
&gt; the EU Anti Trust Commission.
&gt;
&gt; Those of us who are actively developing and manufacturing and making a
&gt; real business out of Linux Audio development could have been selling our
&gt; products on the Android platform for the past 4 years and earning money
&gt; from the sales however due to Googles decision making process we have been
&gt; excluded from that not because it is not technically possible to run our
&gt; software on the platform but because they have decided we are not allowed
&gt; to do so.
&gt;
&gt; The amount of revenue that has been lost to the global professional audio
&gt; industry because of Googles inability or willingness to solve the issues
&gt; preventing professional audio on the Android platform is not an
&gt; insignificant amount. It could be calculated well into the billions based
&gt; on the number of people that are using Android devices.
&gt;
&gt; IMO taking them to court is a last resort but if they fail to take
&gt; appropriate steps to fully address the issues that have been raised
&gt; multiple times in varying ways either through direct communication or on
&gt; the multiple internationally accessible open source mailing lists where
&gt; their own developers are actively participating or invited to participate
&gt; in discussions then it might be the only option to force their hand.
&gt;
&gt; If it is not painfully obvious I don't care what Ralph Maldorf has to say
&gt; on any matter concerning Linux Audio Development.
&gt;
&gt; As other people have attempted to shoot down the points I am making I have
&gt; continued the discussion.The topic is a serious business topic which
&gt; directly involves the software/developers and companies targeting the
&gt; JACK infrastructure and ecosystem.
&gt;
&gt; It could be argued that the slow down in traffic for discussions on this
&gt; mailing list regarding JACK on  PC/desktop can be directly attributed to
&gt; the growth of Android as an OS/platform and the subsequent lack of
&gt; interest in PC based software and tools but that is another topic for
&gt; discussion in ANOTHER location.
