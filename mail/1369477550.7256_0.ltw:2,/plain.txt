well, there is certainly something wrong with netjack there: no point in 
using and reporting a protocol version (which tom reports to be 
identical) if at the same time the jackd versions on both ends have to 
match exactly. so either ditch that protocol version message so as not 
to confuse users, or fix the compatibility issue so that all netjack 
instances claiming to support version 8 actually work together.
plus the versions tom uses are more or less identical, they only differ 
in micro-release, which shouldn't break compatibility at all.

i wonder: is that jack protocol version just the internal one defined in 
jack.h? and is there a separate one for the netjack layer? this needs to 
be clarified.
