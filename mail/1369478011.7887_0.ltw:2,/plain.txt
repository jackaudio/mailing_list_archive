torben, thanks for pressing this important issue. christian, thanks for 
your code contribution and for resolving this quickly now that the issue 
has been raised.

having jack on ios is a great win for the linux audio community, but if 
and only if it means injecting some open source culture into the iphone

_respecting_ the gpl license choice is critical in this matter (besides 
simply complying with it for legal reasons).

have a nice weekend everybody,


jörn
