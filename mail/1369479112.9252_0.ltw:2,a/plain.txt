One final point I'd like to raise:

Pat - you admit/ know that Android is not as free as Debian, Arch, Gentoo
and other glibc based Linux OSs - right? So why put yourself out fighting

JACK NOT being on Android is currently a plus for pulling people toward
proper, openly developed operating systems. Whose side are you on?
