&gt; Hi people!
&gt;
&gt; A saying in maths is "Often it's easier to solve the generalized problem
&gt; than the particular problem instance one is pondering" [paraphrased].
&gt; This post is just a incoherent(?) rambling on what could be the more
&gt; general problem a tool like jack could solve and how the current use of
&gt; jack is just one particular instance of that problem.
&gt;
&gt; Jack is an awesome tool. It allows flexibility in audio routing (and
&gt; more recently midi routing) between vastly different applications,
&gt; services, and tools. But like Paul, and others, have noted, jack
&gt; development with respect to new features has kind of stagnated. I want
&gt; to chime in with a maybe fresh approach to thinking about what jack does
&gt; and how the development of other useful abstractions (like CV ports, but
&gt; also stuff like semantically grouping ports, etc.) could be facilitated.
&gt;
&gt; Jack was initially developed exclusively for audio routing, albeit with
&gt; some preparations for extending the buffer types. This has then done
&gt; with jack midi. For other kind of data this model has become problematic
&gt; though. There is one centralized code base which tries to be the
&gt; solution for all things linux rt audo related. Often a more
&gt; modular/extensible approach has proved to be more fruitful. A library
&gt; which gives users and developers the opportunity to build their own
&gt; abstractions/standards on top of the core set of features. This is also
&gt; a little nod into the direction of LV2 which has its extension mechanism
&gt; and in general to the UNIX philosophy of building small tools that work
&gt; together in concert. The core tools should be flexible enough that new
&gt; data types can be implemented independently of them. Maybe once they
&gt; have proven to be useful they can be integrated into the core
&gt; distribution or standardized in another way.
&gt;
&gt; So coming back to the original question what is the more general
&gt; problem: Jack really is a particular solution to a more general problem
&gt; than just routing audio and midi: How to define and run a data flow
&gt; graph of nodes of applications/services/tools with real time constraints
&gt; on the transport and the execution of the nodes and how to constrain the
&gt; data going over the edges of this graph in such a way that different
&gt; apps/modules/services understand each other.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe it makes sense to ponder if it is is possible to try and create a
&gt; solution for the more general problem of just creating a generic
&gt; transport and scheduling tool for a dataflow graph of nodes with
&gt; realtime constraints. Maybe even relaxing the real time constraints and
&gt; treating them as yet another specialization of the problem makes sense.
&gt;

Over here we are working on JACK-3D for transporting 3d modelling data
between 3d engines like blender and cube2 (for instance).

There is also JACK-Video from Salsaman.


&gt; Of course there is always the danger of taking too much of a mouthful
&gt; for the scope of a project. Something completely general with no
&gt; specialization gets nothing useful done at all. So the question really
&gt; becomes: what level of generality and what kind of abstractions are
&gt; useful now and for future purposes which we are not even aware of yet.
&gt;
&gt; Ideally such a tool would be flexible enough that the current jack API
&gt; could be implemented as a special case thus providing backwards
&gt; compatibility while at the same time being ready for the future.
&gt;

I think JACK is already the defacto platform for sharing realtime data
across FLOSS multimedia applications. Nearly every audio app supports it
and many video apps too.


&gt; Feel free to flame me :D
&gt;

Your right on the money as far as I am concerned.
