But jack was invented to abstract this stuff. Once its started, no app
nor the user (who after all started jack;) should care about which
backend and which device is connected.

And even if you modify jack so it tells you that its running with the
backend A and your device B, there are still several possibilities:
 a) some backends (like the firewire backend and also the alsa-backend
 when you sync cards appropriately) aggregate multiple devices
 b) you can always also connect to other alsa-devices with alsa-in/-out
 and fons' alternatives
 c) your backend might be dummy, thus not connecting to any device or
 d) network and thus connecting to one or several computers running
 multiple devices each
 e) and then you can also have network-slaves in your local
 jack-session that also connect to different machine but aren't a
 backend nor device detectable by jack or other apps.

Have fun,

Arnold
