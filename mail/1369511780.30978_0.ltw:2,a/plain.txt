Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] list current (ALSA) device

Hi Arnold!

It'd be fair enough if we couldn't list the device in most of those cases
as I think they're all pretty niche. Most of the time I'm just using one
regular ALSA device and this is how I expect most people to work and, like
me, I'm sure most would've liked to check this some time or other.

It'd be great for anyone like me who switches ALSA device multiple times a
day.
