Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] list current (ALSA) device

As Filipe says, I'm sorry but the suggestions don't really solve the issue
and please don't pretend the ps/grep combo isn't a kludge. JACK should be
targeting musicians and sound engineers, not sysadmins and devs (although I
realise most on this list are sysadmins and devs and wouldn't be too upset
about having to to a bit of cli magic now and again) but even then they are
likely to forget or not know about such a command for what seems like
pretty fundamental info about JACK's status.

I mainly use cadence to control J2 these days but I'd also like I simple
way to see the current device from jack_control, ideally.
