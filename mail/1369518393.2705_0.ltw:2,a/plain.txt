In case it's not clear, he's fighting for the OS with the largest market
share and therefore the highest potential for profit. Ubuntu Phone or
anything else does not and probably will never fit this definition. Patrick
is not fighting on the side of freedom, and I believe that alone is the
cause of the large impedance mismatch between his statements here and the
general sensibilities of LAD.

Indeed, having a truly free and open mobile platform would be great--for
users. Not so much for 'app' vendors!
