There is no universally accepted solution to the problem. Distro
packagers tend to prefer explicit feature selection at configure stage.
User-o-developers building from source prefer to build with all features
possible.

This particular begaviour was changed some time ago by sletz accepting a
"patch" from a packager.

I'd personally favour building with all available features unless
explicitly specified with something like --with/without-alsa,
--with-alsa=yes/no or --enable/disable-alsa
