Is latency important? If not, ignore all the jackd stuff, run

    mplayer http://central-pc:port/foo

on the slaves and be happy. You can use VLC or any other media streamer
(gstreamer would probably work, too) on the PC.


If you really want/need a jackd-based setup, then do something like
this:

    - PC is master, can even be -d dummy (no local audio I/O)
    - 20 slaves connected with jack_netsource -N slaveX -H slaveX
    - Run alsa_in/alsa_out or even better zita-ajbridge (a2j, j2a) on
      each slave to enable local audio I/O


Cheers
