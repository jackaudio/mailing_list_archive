Latency is important, so I am trying the alsa_in / zita path:


If you really want/need a jackd-based setup, then do something like

This is exactly what I want to do, thanks! Unfortunately, alsa_in/alsa_out
do not seem to be available for the devices (Gumstix Overo). I did find the
zita-ajbridge source and compiled it with no issues, but am getting
floating point exceptions from zita-j2a on initialization:

# zita-j2a -d hw:0,0 -L -r 44100 -p 1024 -v
playback :
  nchan  : 2
  fsamp  : 44100
  fsize  : 1024
  nfrag  : 2
  format : S16_LE
capture  : not enabled
Floating point exception

Fortunately gdb is available and the zita source is very tidy, so...
hopefully I can get to the bottom of it.

Thanks again,
Jason
