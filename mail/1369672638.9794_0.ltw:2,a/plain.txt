That's a good idea. I think such a petition can have a much more
positive impact on goggle than a law suit, not because goggle practice
is acceptable or not, but because it will show to google it is android
users that want to be able to do serious audio work with their products.

To not be able to run jack remain me the time when, on windows (with
some 95 versions), the only possibility to get netscape to
run without troubles, was to uninstall IE before installing netscape. In
this case, it look like to be even worst, because whatever you try, it
is not even possible to install jack.
