Subject:     [Jack-Devel] ARM JACK2 probs

My poor Pandaboard had lay unused for months until recently when I decided
I should try Debian Wheezy on it. I was pleased to discover it runs
quicker, boots quicker, performs faster and is more stable than the Ubuntu
12.04 it ran previously - which is what I had hoped for. Wifi and gfx
aren't working properly (or at at all, as the case with wifi) yet but
that's a discussion for elsewhere.

Like anyone on the JACK mailing list, as soon as I saw the system was
running well on the whole, it was time to see how well it runs JACK! I was
well aware the Wheezy J2 package is a bit archaic now and I had noticed
that some patches had been appled in git recently for ARM so I knew that
compiling J2 from git was the way to go so thats what I did a few days back
and I've since installed Cadence too to make running it easier.

I have a few USB audio devices but the first I tried with JACK on my
Pandaboard was my Philips portable hifi. Running JACK @ 48000/1024/2, I can
keep it running pretty much until I pull the plug without any xruns
although there is a slight backround pop noise every second or so. Not so
bad as to make casual listening impossible but regular and frequent enough
to be a deal-breaker for doing any serious audio work. This device works
well enough to make me believe J2 on ARM is nearly ready, hopefully!

Sadly, I've not has as much luck with my other 2 USB audio devices but I'm
hoping the JACK devs can help me fix those. The one that I've had more
success with is the Focusrite 2i4. I have tried various JACK settings but I
get the same result - JACK starts and runs xrun-free for just over 3m
(about 3m 9s) then the gain input LEDs start blinking in tandem (some sort
of error code) and then I get a steady flow of xruns which I can only stop
by pulling the USB plug. Here is a JACK log for my 2i4:

Of course, the 2i4 runs for much longer than 3m with no probs on my x86
machines. I've got a 3rd USB audio device (Startech 7.1 - I forget the
chipset) that works fine with JACK on my laptop but won't start JACK at all
on my Pandaboard.

Thanks for your help!
