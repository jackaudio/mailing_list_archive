The issues you describe are likely not related to jack at all.

Please try to play a long song with alsa's "aplay". ie confirm it's not
a general USB or audio problem.

My first guess would be power: The 2i4 is USB bus powered. Can your
panda-board provide 500mA to the USB bus? Is the Phillips device also
bus-powered? In either case it could explain the behavior (slight
background noise, pops, unstable USB connection) that you're experiencing.

Also try running with 3 periods of playback latency (-n option). e.g.
  jackd -d alsa -p 1024 -n 3
that helps with many USB devices. Try different period-sizes as well.

Check the output of 'dmesg' when jack disconnects. And also watch
/proc/interrupts (does the audio-device share IRQ with other hardware?)


Some other hints which -- are likely unrelated at this stage but -- can
improve general jack performance (less x-runs at lower latencies) are
apt-get install rtirq (setup IRQ priorities prefer audio-devices)
and also try the Debian's rt-preemt realtime kernel...

so long,
robin
