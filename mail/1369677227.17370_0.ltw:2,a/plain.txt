I shall try that on the Focusrite and Startech soon.

The Philips device is mains powered and I do not hear the popping sound
when I run JACK on it on a x86 machine (and there are no xruns) so this is
certainly not a power issue in the case of this device. Cadence reports 0
xruns yet the constant pop persists.

I've tried the optimal (made period 3) sizes and they all have the same
result. I know what values work well through having experimented with my
devices on x86.

Hmm, I wonder if they do such a kernel for ARM devices too? Prob not.

Thanks for the suggestions Robin!
