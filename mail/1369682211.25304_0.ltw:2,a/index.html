&gt; My poor Pandaboard had lay unused for months until recently when I decided
&gt; I should try Debian Wheezy on it. I was pleased to discover it runs
&gt; quicker, boots quicker, performs faster and is more stable than the Ubuntu
&gt; 12.04 it ran previously - which is what I had hoped for. Wifi and gfx
&gt; aren't working properly (or at at all, as the case with wifi) yet but
&gt; that's a discussion for elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt; Like anyone on the JACK mailing list, as soon as I saw the system was
&gt; running well on the whole, it was time to see how well it runs JACK! I was
&gt; well aware the Wheezy J2 package is a bit archaic now and I had noticed
&gt; that some patches had been appled in git recently for ARM so I knew that
&gt; compiling J2 from git was the way to go so thats what I did a few days back
&gt; and I've since installed Cadence too to make running it easier.
&gt;
&gt; I have a few USB audio devices but the first I tried with JACK on my
&gt; Pandaboard was my Philips portable hifi. Running JACK @ 48000/1024/2, I can
&gt; keep it running pretty much until I pull the plug without any xruns
&gt; although there is a slight backround pop noise every second or so. Not so
&gt; bad as to make casual listening impossible but regular and frequent enough
&gt; to be a deal-breaker for doing any serious audio work. This device works
&gt; well enough to make me believe J2 on ARM is nearly ready, hopefully!
&gt;
&gt; Sadly, I've not has as much luck with my other 2 USB audio devices but I'm
&gt; hoping the JACK devs can help me fix those. The one that I've had more
&gt; success with is the Focusrite 2i4. I have tried various JACK settings but I
&gt; get the same result - JACK starts and runs xrun-free for just over 3m
&gt; (about 3m 9s) then the gain input LEDs start blinking in tandem (some sort
&gt; of error code) and then I get a steady flow of xruns which I can only stop
&gt; by pulling the USB plug. Here is a JACK log for my 2i4:

&gt; Of course, the 2i4 runs for much longer than 3m with no probs on my x86
&gt; machines. I've got a 3rd USB audio device (Startech 7.1 - I forget the
&gt; chipset) that works fine with JACK on my laptop but won't start JACK at all
&gt; on my Pandaboard.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help!

If you're running kernel 3.8, then this may be a known (kernel) issue that
breaks many USB audio devices.
