As was said by Paul and Stephane - even port name could be outdated on this time i.e. when we call jack_get_ports , we must humbly accept scenario where in some other thread this port is just right now removed ;-) ... but this shouldn't stop us to TRY process this port - because then it will be

I'm start digging  in a Jack1 code. I think add support JackPortIsActive flag can be rather complex - because then we need to handle it in few calls (e.g. jack_port_register, jack_activate, jack_deactivate ...).

.. but add jack_port_is_active seems to be pretty simple. In my conception jack_port_is_active will be some kind of trick, cause it will return state of entire client, and we will not keep individual port states i.e. there will be not possible for client to have active and inactive ports in same time.

jack_port_t structure already contain client_id field, so  maybe we can somehow get "active" filed from jack_client_control_t from libjack perspective i.e. without call to jackd ?

Here is my question to jack gurus - is this allowed to obtain such info directly from libjack ? Or maybe there is better solution to get "active" state info ?
