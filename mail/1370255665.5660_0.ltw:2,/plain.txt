and to clarify - the issue is not actually apple having any particular
policy against GPL apps for iOS. the problem is that they will not agree to
distribute source code for any app. thus them distributing the binary image
without offering the source would violate the GPL and make them the guilty
party.

separate issues affect libjack (the jack "SDK"), but in this case it is
because of apple policy - dynamic/runtime/shared linking is not allowed on
iOS, and in combination with the LGPL, this would imply there being a way
for every app user to (statically) relink their app with libjack - clearly
not possible.
