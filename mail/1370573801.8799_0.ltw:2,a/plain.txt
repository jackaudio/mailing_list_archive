Subject:     [Jack-Devel] word length and bit depth

Hi,


I am new to this list and fairly new to Jack. I see that in the setup page of Jack Control the "word length" if using some devices (Portaudio for example) is set to 16 and is not changeable. I also notice that if sun or ssl are selected the word length can be changed but only to 32 or 64.
In my host application (Reaper in this case) it is showing 48k 24bit wav. I am a little confused. Is Jack actually streaming 16 bit or 24 bit audio ? 
As the standard for professional audio is 24bit these days I am hoping that is the case here.
I couldn't see anything about this in FAQ and I couldn't see a separate forum so I'm emailing. Hope that's OK
Many thanks.

Justin Marcus
