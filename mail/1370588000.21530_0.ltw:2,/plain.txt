hi justin,

JACK will always use 32bit floats internally, which is roughly the same 
as 24bit fixed point, but with the added benefit that it does not ever clip.
what actually goes down to your hardware depends on the hardware and 
driver capabilities. most interfaces these days will nominally operate 
at 24 bits, even though the least significant couple of bits will 
usually contain noise only.

best,


jörn
