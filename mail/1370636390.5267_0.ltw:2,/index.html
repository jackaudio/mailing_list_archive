hi justin,



let's keep this discussion on the list so that others can contribute.

&gt; hi Jorn,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much for such a quick response - really very much
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; OK so I understand 32bit floating point - can I clarify: it seems you
&gt; are saying that even when the word length says 16, that it is still
&gt; working internally at 32bit float, and is also still passing 24bit audio
&gt; to/from host/soundcard driver (in my case asio4all for testing purposes) ?

i'm not familiar with jack on windows.

internally (i.e. between native jack clients) the audio sample format is 
always float32.

the soundcard and driver capabilities define what the physical output 
looks like. for most built-in sound chips, that will most certainly be 
16bit integer. higher quality gear will support 24bit output, which does 
not lose resolution if the float32 is clamped between -1.0f and 1.0f.

&gt; The other point I wanted to check, is regarding streaming audio from one
&gt; application to another (for example Reaper to Harrison Mixbus, or Reaper
&gt; to Ensoniq Paris if I can find a way of doing the later via some asio
&gt; vst). One of the guys from Harrison said that I would need the latest
&gt; version of Jack to do this at 24bit and that the version of Jack
&gt; currently included with Mixbus wouldn't do this.

when you include native windows applications without built-in jack 
support, then the word length will depend on the capabilities of that 
virtual soundcard driver, and of course on the application. can't help 
you there, but i'm sure others on this list can fill in the details.

&gt; Any how, I just want to ask if trying to do this is realistic. I also
&gt; understand that on windows there may be some limitations regarding
&gt; syncing transport etc.

i'm sure there are :)

please keep any further replies on the list, so that others can benefit 
from this thread as well.

best,


j&#xF6;rn
