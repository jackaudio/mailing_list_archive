hi justin,



let's keep this discussion on the list so that others can contribute.

i'm not familiar with jack on windows.

internally (i.e. between native jack clients) the audio sample format is 
always float32.

the soundcard and driver capabilities define what the physical output 
looks like. for most built-in sound chips, that will most certainly be 
16bit integer. higher quality gear will support 24bit output, which does 
not lose resolution if the float32 is clamped between -1.0f and 1.0f.

when you include native windows applications without built-in jack 
support, then the word length will depend on the capabilities of that 
virtual soundcard driver, and of course on the application. can't help 
you there, but i'm sure others on this list can fill in the details.

i'm sure there are :)

please keep any further replies on the list, so that others can benefit 
from this thread as well.

best,
