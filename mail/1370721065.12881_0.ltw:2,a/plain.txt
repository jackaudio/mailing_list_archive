Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Cannot connect to server socket err

Hi!

I'm not aware of touching anything involved, but jackd / anything 
supposed to use it stopped working.

So I start jackd like I do since many months:

~: jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:M66 -p 1024

Then, for example:

Ardour and Patchage will also fail with "Cannot connect to server socket 
...".

jack_simple_client only says "engine sample rate: 48000", but makes no beep.

The only installed jack is current git (previously 0.121.3), with 
--prefix=/usr. There is no jack stuff below /usr/local.

There is no pulseaudio running.

Any ideas?
