Hello,

I have a small problem with NetJack2 setup with two Ubuntu boxes.
It seems that whatever I do i can not establish master-slave connection
between these two boxes. I tried to follow various tutorials but in all
cases the end goal could not be reached and it always stops at "Waiting for
master..."

By default ubuntu ships with 1.9.9 version that through the process of hope
i updated to 1.9.9.5 and then to 1.9.10 (git) version. In all cases the
outcome was the same.

Just to be clear i did the following things on the master and slave boxes
to initiate the connection:

$master&gt;jackd -d alsa &amp;
$master&gt;jack_load netmanager
$slave&gt;jackd -d net

# Then i tried  on the slave, (10.125.113.194) is ip of the master
$slave&gt;jackd -d net  -a 10.125.113.194 # this does not succeed either


The important thing is that when I try to add net agent locally it works on
both machines.
$master&gt;jackd -d alsa&amp;;
$master&gt;jack_load netmanager
$master&gt;jackd -n test -d net -a 127.0.0.1 # it works

My current understanding is that the there is some kind of issue with
network since it works locally. But the weird thing is that I am working
with the slave remotly over the SSH which should imply that the boxes are
reachable.
Also I flushed all iptables (filter, nat and masquerade on both machines),
so there shouldn't be an issue of fw.

Also master can see broadcast packets sent from the slave
$master&gt; tcpdump udp port 19000 # or tcpdump multicast

.. and I am using linux bridge interface that bridges linux slave box and
mikrotik internet gateway. netstat -gn lists that netmanager has registered
multicast ip address  on that bridge interface.

It seems that everything I do is not relevant and it always stops at that
night haunting message:
"*Waiting for the master...*"

.... so pls. could someone point me towards the master...
