Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jack on android

Who's going to port it? JACK, that it is?

If that happens, I'd love to see qtractor on Android. Does Android's
TinyALSA (or whatever its stripped down version is called) provide enough
of full ALSA for this to be possible? Any idea RNCBC?

I've got a mini BT keyboard + touchpad for my Nexus 4 so I may be able to
run such an app but I think many X11 apps would be unusable on a phone or
small tablet with touch only hence the GUI's would need to be reworked for
many apps if they want to play nice with touch.
