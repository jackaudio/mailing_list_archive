Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jack on android

Hi J!

Yes, there is currently a Fedora installer and a Ubuntu Touch installer for
the Nexus 4. Fedora on Nexus 4 is very new and I have never liked Fedora,
yum/rpm and its installer, anaconda. Ubuntu Touch is based on Cyanogen mod
and is still in alpha/beta - I see no reason anyone should bother with
Ubuntu Touch yet unless they're very curious or they want to help with
development.

When someone releases Debian or Ubuntu for Nexus 4 I may bite and dual boot
but until then I am happy running the stock, stable and feature complete JB
ROM and using bvnc to access my Debian VNC server, which is obviously no
use for JACK. I've got sunvox running under Android so that'll satisfy my
desire for making funny noises on the move for the mo.
