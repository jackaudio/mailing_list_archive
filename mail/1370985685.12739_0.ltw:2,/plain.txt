Looks like simply because it's not used. Or you're changing volume on 
wrong port (sink).
You can use commands with pacmd/pactl to identify whether pa is used 
and which port if it is.
I.e. here's how I'd do it
ruff@box:~$ lsof -n | awk '/\/dev\/snd\//{print$1}'|sort -u
jackdbus
## snd is used exclusively by jack
ruff@box:~$ jack_lsp -c | grep -m1 -A3 system:playback_1
system:playback_1
   PulseAudio JACK Sink:front-left
system:playback_2
   PulseAudio JACK Sink:front-right
### playback is connected to Pulse only right now
ruff@box:~$ pacmd list-sinks
Welcome to PulseAudio! Use "help" for usage information.
>>> 1 sink(s) available.
  * index: 1
	name: <jack_out>
	driver: <module-jack-sink.c>
	flags: DECIBEL_VOLUME LATENCY
	state: SUSPENDED
	suspend cause: IDLE
	priority: 0
	volume: 0:  97% 1:  97%
	        0: -0,79 dB 1: -0,79 dB
	        balance 0,00
...
### Pulse has jack_out sink as default and it is set to 97% volume
ruff@box:~$ pacmd list-sink-inputs 1
Welcome to PulseAudio! Use "help" for usage information.
>>> 1 sink input(s) available.
    index: 8
	driver: <protocol-native.c>
	flags:
	state: RUNNING
	sink: 1 <jack_out>
	volume: 0: 100% 1: 100%
... snip ...
	client: 24 <ALSA plug-in [plugin-container]>
	properties:
		media.name = "ALSA Playback"
		application.name = "ALSA plug-in [plugin-container]"
		native-protocol.peer = "UNIX socket client"
		native-protocol.version = "27"
		application.process.id = "4253"
### and it plays sound from firefox plugin container

If you wish you can reconnect source to another sink (eg. if it plays 
not to jack_out but to alsa directly)
$ pacmd move-sink-input 8 1
### move input with id 8 (ff plugin) to sink 1 (jack_out)
$ pacmd set-sink-volume 1 32000
### set volume on sink 1 to 50% (of 65536)
$ pacmd set-sink-input-volume 8 65535
### set volume on input 8 to 100%
etc.
