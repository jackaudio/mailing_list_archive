&gt; Hello Ruslan and whole Jack community :)
&gt;
&gt; I think that this patch should certainly be included in the next
&gt; release because it seems that mainline NetJack2 module (netmanager)
&gt; does not scale well with more complex network configurations.
&gt; The thing is that in my opinion, network config that I use is not
&gt; something extreme in any way since it is only using standard linux
&gt; bridge nic that binds two ethernet cards and few virtual lxc/qemu nics.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now with that said, I need to ask you (the community), are there some
&gt; configuration tips for NetJack2 that could reduce latency between
&gt; master's and the slave's playback (audioadapter module).  Two machines
&gt; are connected by 100Mbit (duplex) links which by ping have about
&gt; 200micro seconds round trip time. On both machines I am using simple
&gt; motherboard build in audio output devices.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you in advance
&gt;

Yes, there are improvements in netjack latency but my ppa is based on 
pre-improvement code (actually stock ubuntu code + iface selection + 
ipv6).
Looks like it's time to refresh the archive. :)

&gt;     Hi Antun,
&gt;     The patch is actually is being reviewed currently since I've made
&gt;     a pull request to the trunk. Pull request is not only to improve
&gt;     handshake but also to add IPv6 support, so it takes some time.
&gt;     I've mistakenly pressed Reply instead of Group-reply so it went to
&gt;     you only, otherwise feel free to comment your experience on the
&gt;     list or I can repeat the reply to keep the thread consistent.
&gt;     Glad it helped.
&gt;     Regards,

&gt;         Hello Ruslan,
&gt;
&gt;         first I want to thank you for your help.
&gt;         To answer your question, slave is not multihomed, only master is.
&gt;         I have installed jackd2 (only on the master) from your repo
&gt;         and it worked with a "-a" flag (on slave) that pointed to the
&gt;         master.
&gt;
&gt;         So if anybody else has the same problem with the "waiting for
&gt;         the master..." state, get yourself a "copy" of
&gt;          (*ppa:rufferson/snd*) ppa and save ~15h of torcher.
&gt;
&gt;         one more time ... thx for the help :)

&gt;                 Hello,
&gt;
&gt;                 I have a small problem with NetJack2 setup with two
&gt;                 Ubuntu boxes.
&gt;                 It seems that whatever I do i can not establish
&gt;                 master-slave
&gt;                 connection between these two boxes. I tried to follow
&gt;                 various
&gt;                 tutorials but in all cases the end goal could not be
&gt;                 reached and it
&gt;                 always stops at "Waiting for master..."
&gt;
&gt;                 By default ubuntu ships with 1.9.9 version that
&gt;                 through the process of
&gt;                 hope i updated to 1.9.9.5 and then to 1.9.10 (git)
&gt;                 version. In all
&gt;                 cases the outcome was the same.
&gt;
&gt;                 Just to be clear i did the following things on the
&gt;                 master and slave
&gt;                 boxes to initiate the connection:
&gt;
&gt;                 $master&gt;jackd -d alsa &amp;
&gt;                 $master&gt;jack_load netmanager
&gt;                 $slave&gt;jackd -d net
&gt;
&gt;                 # Then i tried  on the slave, (10.125.113.194) is ip
&gt;                 of the master
&gt;                 $slave&gt;jackd -d net  -a 10.125.113.194 # this does not
&gt;                 succeed either
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;                 The important thing is that when I try to add net
&gt;                 agent locally it
&gt;                 works on both machines.
&gt;                 $master&gt;jackd -d alsa&amp;;
&gt;                 $master&gt;jack_load netmanager
&gt;                 $master&gt;jackd -n test -d net -a 127.0.0.1 # it works
&gt;
&gt;                 My current understanding is that the there is some
&gt;                 kind of issue with
&gt;                 network since it works locally. But the weird thing is
&gt;                 that I am
&gt;                 working with the slave remotly over the SSH which
&gt;                 should imply that
&gt;                 the boxes are reachable.
&gt;                 Also I flushed all iptables (filter, nat and
&gt;                 masquerade on both
&gt;                 machines), so there shouldn't be an issue of fw.
&gt;
&gt;                 Also master can see broadcast packets sent from the slave
&gt;                 $master&gt; tcpdump udp port 19000 # or tcpdump multicast
&gt;
&gt;                 .. and I am using linux bridge interface that bridges
&gt;                 linux slave box
&gt;                 and mikrotik internet gateway. netstat -gn lists that
&gt;                 netmanager has
&gt;                 registered multicast ip address  on that bridge interface.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;             That could be the problem. Is slave multihomed btw?
&gt;             The thing is that handshake implementation currently is a
&gt;             bit naive and fails whenever more complex network setup
&gt;             occurs.
&gt;             As I'm always saying in this cases - you can try out the
&gt;             build from my ppa (ppa:rufferson/snd) and explicitly
&gt;             specify interface you want to work on (-f br0).
&gt;             It also has more debug entries in various network related
&gt;             points so may shed more light on where the problem is exactly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;                 It seems that everything I do is not relevant and it
&gt;                 always stops at
&gt;                 that night haunting message:
&gt;                 "*Waiting for the master...*"
&gt;
&gt;
