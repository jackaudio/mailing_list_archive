In-Reply-To: Adrian Knoth [Jack-Devel] jackd1: watchdog problems (+patch) (1371216568.27113_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jackd1: watchdog problems (+patch)

The reporter is making at least one valid point (a race condition when
existing freewheeling), but I don't believe that his patch is really
correct.

Nothing should hold the graph lock for 5 seconds, and if it is held for
that long, then it is pretty much precisely the scenario the watchdog
is/was intended to intervene in by killing JACK.

Whether we really need a watchdog at all anymore is a more important
question. JACK can no longer lock up the system because of cpu limits ...
