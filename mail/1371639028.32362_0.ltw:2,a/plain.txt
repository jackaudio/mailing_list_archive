Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Streaming JACK over broadband internet?

Hi Jack-Devel, I'm new to this list but have been using JACK for computer
music and speech research for about 5 years.

I'm looking for a nice way to stream audio over the internet -- from my
house (on 2Mb BT home broadband) to my office (fast UK academic internet
connection).

Latency is not important (up to, say 10 seconds is fine) but I do care
about having as few dropouts as possible to keep a good quality audio
signal.

I've looked briefly at netjack, which AFAICT is focussed more on
now-latency applications on an intranet;   and jack.trip, which is
described as for 'internet2' WANs, which is perhaps still requiring faster
wired than I have here.

So I'm currently thinking about writing my own little JACK client that will
just read in audio, then write it out of a TCPIP socket, to be picked up at
the other end.    I'm wondering if anyone out there has already written one
of these somewhere that I could use?    Or if anyone has experience of
using netjack or jack.trip to get the desired behaviour of high audio
quality with allowed high latency.

Any tips would be really useful!

Thanks,
Charles Fox
