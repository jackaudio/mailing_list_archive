Hi Charles!

I've yet to try it myself but the original netjack (or netone backend under
J2) allows for JACK over regular broadband internet, allegedly. As you
correctly state, the newer versions of netjack require a LAN connection.

&gt; Hi Jack-Devel, I'm new to this list but have been using JACK for computer
&gt; music and speech research for about 5 years.
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking for a nice way to stream audio over the internet -- from my
&gt; house (on 2Mb BT home broadband) to my office (fast UK academic internet
&gt; connection).
&gt;
&gt; Latency is not important (up to, say 10 seconds is fine) but I do care
&gt; about having as few dropouts as possible to keep a good quality audio
&gt; signal.
&gt;
&gt; I've looked briefly at netjack, which AFAICT is focussed more on
&gt; now-latency applications on an intranet;   and jack.trip, which is
&gt; described as for 'internet2' WANs, which is perhaps still requiring faster
&gt; wired than I have here.
&gt;
&gt; So I'm currently thinking about writing my own little JACK client that
&gt; will just read in audio, then write it out of a TCPIP socket, to be picked
&gt; up at the other end.    I'm wondering if anyone out there has already
&gt; written one of these somewhere that I could use?    Or if anyone has
&gt; experience of using netjack or jack.trip to get the desired behaviour of
&gt; high audio quality with allowed high latency.
&gt;
&gt; Any tips would be really useful!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Charles Fox
