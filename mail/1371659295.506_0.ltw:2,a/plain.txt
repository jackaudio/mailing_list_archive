Thanks very much for all the useful comments so far.

Looks like I will take a look at netJack1 then, as well as see how far I
can get with a really simple DIY client that just spits all its input into
a TCPIP socket.

Other media streamers could also be a possibility then, however my system
on the home machine is all JACK-based so it seems to make sense to do the
streaming also in JACK, even though I don't need sample synchrony or low
latency.  So I'd still need a JACK interface to icecast/GStreamer/VLC, and
I'd need to learn a new API to read the data at the receiving end.  I see ices,
muse, darkice, savonet,mentioned as icecast servers that will take JACK
input, I wonder if any of these are any good?

Charles
