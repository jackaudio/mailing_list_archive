Maybe it would be good to clarify what you are trying to stream.
Live output generated from application?  Audio from a midi driven soft
synth?  Mix output from ardour?

I was assuming that you were talking about streaming audio files, in which
case the application streaming the audio would just read the files from
disk and stick the data in TCP/IP packets.

&gt; I'd need to learn a new API to read the data at the receiving end.

More realistically you would probably just use an application that knows
how to do that, like VLC, or Firefox.

Again, it might be useful to clarify exactly what you are trying to
achieve.  Do you want to play the music files on your home computer at
work?  Since you said high latency was acceptable, I assume you aren't
doing something like trying to use an application remotely, and you want
audio from that application routed along with the graphics (in which case
I assume you would just use RDP or NX or some other remote desktop style
protocol which supports routing audio along with the video).

For that matter, do you even need an application at the house end?  VLC
supports playing files from FTP and HTTP, could you just tunnel FTP or
HTTP traffic over SSH and play the files from your home computer with VLC
on your work computer?  No need to make things really complicated if just
picking a file or directory from the menu will do what you want.
That is assuming that just playing your library of files at home on your
work machine is what you actually want, as opposed to some other use case.
