Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Fwd: Bug#712484: [jackd2] "Cannot create shm registry segment (Permission denied)"

Hi!


Here's a Debian bug report we've recently received. The /run/shm issue
is not critical, it's certainly working for most people, so somebody
will figure out why /run/shm wasn't mounted. /dev/shm is just a symlink
to /run/shm on Debian systems these days.

More importantly: do we care about the aspect mentioned in the wiki? It
says:

   If you're using /dev/shm directly, then your package is broken. You
   should only be accessing it via the eglibc shm_* and sem_* functions
   implementing the POSIX SHM and SEM features. If we do eventually
   deprecate /dev/shm in favour of /run/shm, eglibc will need
   configuring to use /run/shm directly. In consequence, if you are
   using the standard interfaces such as shm_open, sem_open etc., no
   transition is required.


The same more or less holds true for jackd1. I'm perfectly happy to keep
the status quo and do a downstream package transition instead of
changing code upstream. However, if you prefer to go the shm_* way, I
can give it a shot.


WDYT?

Package: jackd2
Version: 1.9.8~dfsg.4+20120529git007cdc37-5
Severity: minor

--- Please enter the report below this line. ---
Since few time i'm was unable to launch jackd with the following message
: « Cannot create shm registry segment (Permission denied) »

I found this is mostly due to /run/shm which wasn't mounted as tmpfs
(btw i don't know were to report this bug).

However it seems jackd is also guilty because it tries to access
/dev/shm instead of /run/shm. According to release notes of /run
migration (
http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/RunDirectory#Packages_using_.2Fdev.2Fshm
) this shall be done with shm_* and sem_*. Could you correct this ?

Thanks
