Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fwd: Bug#712484: [jackd2] "Cannot create shm registry segment (Permission denied)"

currently in jack1 the choice between sysv and posix shm APIs was/is made
on the basis of one of them not working. i personally prefer the posix one
(shm_open, etc), but it has to actually work correctly to be useful.

now you're going to ask me what was broken about it ...
