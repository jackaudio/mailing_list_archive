Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Rust Bindings

Hi everyone,
    I've been playing around with writing Rust bindings to Jack recently
despite limited experience with the API.  For the most part everything has
gone very smoothly but I do have some high level questions regarding normal
operation.

1)I have noticed that if create a jack_ringbuffer of say size 4096 and then
immediately query the initial write space available with
jack_ringbuffer_write_space, I get 4095 back. Is there some kind of
preferences for odd numbers here?

2)Another interested behaviour I have observed is that Jack will 'mute' my
client if I attempt to push very large floats into my port buffer from
within my callback.  Is this expected behaviour?  Are there any other
conditions that might trigger it?  And is there some kind of callback which
I can use to subscribe to messages from the Jack Server letting me know
when such an event has occurred?

Thanks,
-Paul SC
