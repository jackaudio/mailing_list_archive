Are there any other conditions that might trigger it?  And is there some kind of callback which I can use to subscribe to messages from the Jack Server letting me know when such an event has occurred?

Sure, that makes sense. I was just assuming that jack would somehow alert my client of its improper behaviour. Does such mechanism exist(even for general purpose errors) and if so what is the nescessary API call to establish subscription to these notifications?

Thanks,
