Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Rust Bindings

Gotcha.  Thanks for your patience, Mr. Davis. :)


The api documentation lists several callbacks which were seem to be related
to error conditions: jack_on_shutdown, jack_on_info_shutdown, and
jack_set_xrun_callback.  Regarding the first two, which conditions would
cause the Jack server to shutdown my client thread?

Xruns, as I understand it, are the result of Jack server having
insufficient time to process its entire call graph and thus result in a
loss of audio.  Does the server take any action in the event of an xrun?
 Would it, for instance, penalize a long running client thread by removing
it from the processing graph?

Thanks,
-Paul SC
