I don't think there is *any* impact on sound quality: the audio data on
both sides is binary identical: hence no loss by transmission.

So perceptually they're identical (netjack uses float as sample format, at
the same samplerate: so just like an normal JACK patchbay connection,
nothing is lost ). For details on encoding etc on netjack checkout this
page http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack
Using certain encodings / bit-depths will cause reduction in sound quality:
as defaults I think its binary identical... perhaps don't quote me though,
I'm not an author of any of the implementations...

> Question that come to mind are,
The questions that will show the difference between netjack, netjack2 and
JackTrip are how jitter / packet loss / latency are handled / compensated
for.

HTH, -Harry
