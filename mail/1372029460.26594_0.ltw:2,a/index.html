Thanks Harry, Ralf for your suggestions.

I agree it's important to check by listening and trust the ears! It can
fool you though, just try to do the 'pepsi' test with a song as original
wave and the same as 256kbit/s mp3. You probably won't hear the difference
but it's there. :)

Another suggestion i got for testing is to route host A -&gt; host B -&gt; host
A, phase-invert signal and see what remains.

I learned jacktrip is lossless so if the network link is ok, the data
should be identical (except for rounding errors if using different bit
depth).

Cheers,
Thomas

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to find out the impact on signal quality when using

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't think there is *any* impact on sound quality: the audio data
&gt;&gt; &gt; on both sides is binary identical: hence no loss by transmission.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; So perceptually they're identical (netjack uses float as sample
&gt;&gt; &gt; format, at the same samplerate: so just like an normal JACK patchbay
&gt;&gt; &gt; connection, nothing is lost ). For details on encoding etc on netjack
&gt;&gt; &gt; checkout this page
&gt;&gt; &gt; http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Using certain encodings / bit-depths will cause reduction in sound
&gt;&gt; &gt; quality: as defaults I think its binary identical... perhaps don't
&gt;&gt; &gt; quote me though, I'm not an author of any of the implementations...
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Question that come to mind are,
&gt;&gt; &gt; The questions that will show the difference between netjack, netjack2
&gt;&gt; &gt; and JackTrip are how jitter / packet loss / latency are handled /
&gt;&gt; &gt; compensated for.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; HTH, -Harry
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Audacity enables to show a spectrum. When I heard something that nobody
&gt;&gt; else was able to hear, for something that should be a 1:1 digital copy,
&gt;&gt; I could show that the spectrum did differ. It must be somewhere in the
&gt;&gt; Qtractor devel archive. It was a Jack connection from Qtractor out to
&gt;&gt; Qtractor in to mix down the recordings. However, I always wonder that
&gt;&gt; people want to measure things, when they don't hear a difference. Why?
&gt;&gt; If we can't hear it, than it's not an issue. Some time ago I read that
&gt;&gt; somebody wanted to verify by _watching_, if his music has the Katz
&gt;&gt; dynamic and not a loudness war dynamic. It's irrelevant what a meter
&gt;&gt; does tell us, important is what we're able to hear.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My advice is to use the ears. If the OP can't hear a difference there's
&gt;&gt; no need to check it with a tool. If a difference is audible where no
&gt;&gt; difference should be, than tools are needed for troubleshooting.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2 Cents,
&gt;&gt; Ralf
&gt;
&gt; PS: Sending the signal several times from A to B and B to A or just from
&gt; A to B and than a recording done with B again from A to B, would
&gt; increase eventually existing loss by rounding errors, jitter, bad cables
&gt; or what ever in what ever analog or digital signal chain might be
&gt; possible.
