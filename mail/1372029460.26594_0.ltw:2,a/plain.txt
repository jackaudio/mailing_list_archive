Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Network Audio Transmission - Quality

Thanks Harry, Ralf for your suggestions.

I agree it's important to check by listening and trust the ears! It can
fool you though, just try to do the 'pepsi' test with a song as original
wave and the same as 256kbit/s mp3. You probably won't hear the difference
but it's there. :)

Another suggestion i got for testing is to route host A -> host B -> host
A, phase-invert signal and see what remains.

I learned jacktrip is lossless so if the network link is ok, the data
should be identical (except for rounding errors if using different bit
depth).

Cheers,
Thomas
