If I couldn't hear a difference between an original .wav file and a 256kb/s
mp3 I'd repair my monitoring equipment. In my experience mp3 encoding at
256kb/s can even change the perceived balance between elements in a mix,
sometimes requiring a remix if that is the main release format.

Back on topic, a simple null test is a good way of showing differences
between two audio files, particularly if your monitoring equipment has
insufficient resolution to reveal them when played normally. If there is
any difference over the network, something is broken.
