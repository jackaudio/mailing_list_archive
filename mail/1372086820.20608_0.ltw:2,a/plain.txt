Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Network Audio Transmission - Quality

Hi,
well it depends on encoding quality too..
Looking at uncompressed and mp3 side by side in baudline, one of the most
obvious differences is that mp3 cuts off at say 18khz. We can hear up to
20khz it's said. When you try with closed earphones, and someone plays a
sine at 16khz (say in jaaa), i would be surprised if anyone can
consciously hear it (easy to test). But some people have very sensitive
ears indeed.
Greetings,
Thomas
