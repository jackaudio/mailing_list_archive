Interesting theory. I can definitely hear the difference quite clearly between even
a 320kb/s mp3 and the original .wav file. That's using lame on the highest quality
setting, so it isn't as if I'm using a broken encoder. It becomes less distinguishable
if the playback system is bad enough, but it doesn't take esoteric equipment to reveal
it.

Most of the other audio engineers and many musicians I work with can hear the same
thing. That's quite interesting as it covers many styles of music like classical and
acoustic folk, not just loud stuff.

I'm more inclined to believe that those who use critical listening skills in their
work can develop the ability to hear these things through constant practice.
