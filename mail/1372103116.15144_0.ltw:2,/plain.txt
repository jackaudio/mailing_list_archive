Have you ever actually tried this double blind? I know at least a dozen
folks who SWORE that they could tell the difference, and indeed, in
non-blind tests, they could accurately identify certain "artifacts" in the
mp3. in double blind testing, they all lost the ability to do better than
50% ....

There is no evidence that acoustic perception can be trained There may be
specific characteristics of compressed (or even just digitally sampled
audio) that one can learn to look for. The problem is that every time some
"golden eared" listener attempts to explan what they are, double blind
testing suggests that they are wrong.
