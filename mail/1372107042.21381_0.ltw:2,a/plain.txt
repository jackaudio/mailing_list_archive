I haven't done a formal double blind test, but I regularly test colleagues
(and vice versa) by playing mp3s and wav files without telling the listener
which is which. The success rate with certain listeners is close to 100%.

Double blind tests prove that a particular set of listeners in a particular
set of circumstances can or can't hear something. The circumstances are
important. I know that if I'm tired or stressed I find it more difficult to
concentrate well enough to hear subtle differences, for example.

I agree that physical perception of sounds can not be trained, but I do
believe that the ability to distinguish certain elements in what we are
hearing can be improved by training.
