Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack2 send 16bit samples

Hi,

I'm using Jack2 to send and receive audio between a big amount of devices,
most of them ARMs. I compiled Jack2 with this patch:
http://jack-audio.10948.n7.nabble.com/Jack-Devel-jack2-on-ARM-patch-td15962.html

I will like to send the mic signal at 22050Hz and 16bit and receive audio at
44100Hz and 16bit. At the moment, I can only make it work with 32bit and the
network traffic is too high. I'm going to have over 100 devices in a group
call and I need to keep the network traffic low with a decent sound quality.

I have tried to set jackd with --shorts, jack_netsource with -n 512 -c 100,
tried to change the alsa driver to sample at 16bits,.... but I either get
errors with sample too long or short or a core dump... and many others.

Is it even possible to send 16bit with Jack2?
Is there any other way to lower the network traffic?

Thanks for you help,
Katu
