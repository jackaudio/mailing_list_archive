&gt;&gt; Many years ago when I worked on AMS Neve's AudioFile DAW, our R&amp;D guys  
&gt;&gt; came up with a new design to improve the phase response of its  
&gt;&gt; brick-wall filters, after countless complaints from BBC sound mixers.   
&gt;&gt; Subtleties in phase are notoriously difficult to detect and the guys  
&gt;&gt; were pretty confident that no-one would be able to hear the difference,  
&gt;&gt; even though the phase response was measurably more linear - but I could  
&gt;&gt; hear it.  In testing, I could tell with 100% reliability whether the old  
&gt;&gt; filter or the new filter was being used.  The tests were (literally)  
&gt;&gt; double-blind in the sense that I was forced to wear a blindfold AND to  
&gt;&gt; wear headphones, so that I couldn't be influenced by knowing which  
&gt;&gt; system was playing - nor by the direction or acoustic characteristics of  
&gt;&gt; the sound coming from different loudspeakers.  What's interesting is  
&gt;&gt; that out of an R&amp;D dept of over 40 people, I was the only one who could  
&gt;&gt; hear the difference!
&gt; 
&gt; And it was quite likely a difference in the level of some side effect like
&gt; pre-echo that you could hear, rather than the difference in phase response
&gt; itself. That's what makes it so hard to convince those that don't hear the
&gt; problem. The theory says something is inaudible, but they aren't looking
&gt; at what else is going on.
&gt; 

Exactly.  Too many people believe that if the frequency response is adequate to cover the range of human hearing and the dynamic range is similarly adequate, that's enough - whereas in fact, things can be audible without them being related to either of those things.  In this particular case the new filters gave a much more "defined" stereo image, instead of the slightly "muddy" image produced by our original filters.  I found it so easy to detect that I was genuinely surprised at how few others could hear it.
