Exactly.  Too many people believe that if the frequency response is adequate to cover the range of human hearing and the dynamic range is similarly adequate, that's enough - whereas in fact, things can be audible without them being related to either of those things.  In this particular case the new filters gave a much more "defined" stereo image, instead of the slightly "muddy" image produced by our original filters.  I found it so easy to detect that I was genuinely surprised at how few others could hear it.
