Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows 8

Hi Chad,

There are some permission issues that all Windows users need to deal
with when using JACK for Windows, primarily that the JACK server and
the Client applications need to be all running at the same permissions
level...

If you can describe what your 'issues' are then we can perhaps help with them.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
