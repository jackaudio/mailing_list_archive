&gt; can convey depth - and yet I always perceive depth when listening to  
&gt; stereo material.  Out of all the sound mixers, only me and one other  
&gt; person could hear the lack of depth.  Nobody else could detect it.

I've had similar listening experiences. I believe the causes of these
things are measurable, if only we knew what to measure!

&gt; In truth, the perception of depth was probably inside our brains - but  
&gt; something about those speakers wasn't stimulating whatever it was that  
&gt; produced that effect in us.  What this proves is that psychoacoustics  
&gt; are very real.  Hearing isn't (simply) a mechanical transmission  
&gt; process.

Yes, and given the variation between humans, everybody's psychoacoustic
processing will be slightly different. In the case of a lossy codec, it's
unrealistic to expect that everybody will conform equally to the
psychacoustic profile on which it is based.
