Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Cannot use real-time scheduling (RR/89)(1: Operation not permitted)

I'm trying to start jackd with a systemd script on Arch Linux but I'm 
having a problem with RT scheduling.

When I start jack from the command line it works fine:

$ /usr/bin/jackd -R -P89 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p128 -n3

But if try to start it with a systemd script that contains the same 
command it runs, but with the following error (which makes it sound 
really bad!):

$ sudo systemctl status jack

It is run as a user that is assigned to the audio group, not as root. 
Also, the user has the following permissions in 
/etc/security/limits.d/99-audio.conf:

@audio - rtprio 99
@audio - memlock unlimited

How can I enable real-time scheduling from a systemd script?

thanks
James
