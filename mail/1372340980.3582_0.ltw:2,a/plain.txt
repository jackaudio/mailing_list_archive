Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jackdmp 1.9.10 stops running after some hours on BBB

Hello,

i have a problem with jack, and i don't know how to fix (it might be
unrelated to jack).

Jack and jack applications run fine, but after some hours the applications
are gone and only jack remains there as a process in a strange state.

Jack is starded like this:
$ jackd -R --timeout 5000 -v -d alsa -r44100 -n3 -p1024 -d hw:1,0 >
~/log/jackd.log 2>&1 &

jackdmp 1.9.10

JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10

Jack: playback device hw:1,0
Jack: capture device hw:1,0
Jack: apparent rate = 44100
Jack: frames per period = 1024
....


after some hours (roughly 6 hours), the log file is filled up (100s of MB)
with these lines (it keeps filling until jack killed):

Jack: **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 0.117 msecs
Jack: ALSA XRun wait_status = 0

Jack: JackEngine::ClientNotify: no callback for notification = 3
Jack: **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 0.166 msecs
Jack: ALSA XRun wait_status = 0
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 1 fd = 8
Jack: JackRequest::Notification
Jack: JackEngine::ClientNotify: no callback for notification = 3

...

When the system is in that state, it can be operated (for instance tail
the log) etc. but i need to restart jack and start all audio apps again. I
have tried with different apps (once with jacktrip, once with darkice) and
got multiple times the same result after over-night run.

An observation is that the load is quite high when it runs as expected,
but CPU seems not to be at limit, /dev/shm has space left, iotop looks
good.

Thanks for any suggestions,

Thomas
