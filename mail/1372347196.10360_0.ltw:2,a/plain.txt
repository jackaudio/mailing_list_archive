I'm not sure what the problem is, but that in itself is partially my
fault.  I wrote the WinMME driver, but don't own a Windows box and have
never actually used the driver.

What you've posted above points to an error in the code I wrote, that being
that the exceptions are being caught by value instead of by reference.  If
they had been caught by reference, then you'd likely see proper error
messages in place of "std::exception".

@Stephane: Can you change the code such that the exceptions are caught by
reference, and verify that the code prints error messages after the fix?  I
don't have time to submit a patch at the moment.
