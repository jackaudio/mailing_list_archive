That reminds me....

When we first started using Jack on Windows we had a situation where it's log files would eventually grow so big (both in size and in number) that they'd eventually fill up the user's C:\ drive.  This left absolutely no more space available and it would pretty much prevent anything from running properly.  With my particular drive it would take several days to reach that stage though.  Sooner, I guess, for a smaller drive.

Tom - it's a long shot as I haven't seen that problem for over a year now but maybe you should check to see if your disk space is mysteriously depleting whenever this happens.
