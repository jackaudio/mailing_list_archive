In my opinion the best option so far is for libopus to enable custom 
modes: Primary aim in Debian is to enable most possible features - being 
fastest possible has lower priority so can wait until done properly.

...and convenience code copies is explicitly discouraged in Policy, so 
range far lower on the list!

That would obviously be most elegant if upstream could offer both 
concurrently.
