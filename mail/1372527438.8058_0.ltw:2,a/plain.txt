Ron, what do you think about the following?

Instead of using embedded copies in jackd1/2, let's build two flavours
of OPUS from a single source package.

Just sketching now:

libopus0 will provide /usr/lib/libopus.so.0 (business as usual)
libopus-custom-0 will provide /usr/lib/libopus-custom.so.0

In addition, we'll keep libopus-dev and introduce libopus-custom-dev
containing the additional files and a dependency on libopus-custom-0.

All packages will be co-installable, since no file conflict will occur.

In jackd1/2, we'll build-depend on libopus-custom-dev and link against
libopus-custom instead of libopus.


It's certainly a bit of work on your side (building two binary sets from
the same source). OTOH, at least CDBS supports flavours out of the box,
we use it in ardour to build ardour (generic), ardour-i686 (SSE) and
ardour-altivec.


How does this sound to you?
