Hi,

So the background (that's been missing from the BTS up until now) is
that shortly after Robin initially reported this bug, he also contacted
us upstream and we had a fairly detailed discussion on IRC about all the
various issues.  Since Debian was in freeze there wasn't much going to
happen with the package right then, and it wasn't clear at the end of
the discussion whether netjack was still going to use the custom modes
after all.

But it is time now to decide on this soon, so I got in touch with Robin
again yesterday to see what constraints we really have to work with.

My understanding of the background prior to that is that Robin had some
discussion with some of the developers at FOMS, who at the time suggested
the custom modes probably would be appropriate for the use described to
them.

The later discussion on IRC however (including the developers who were
at FOMS) was much less conclusive, and it wasn't at all clear after that,
that the need to do this outweighed the costs, both in general, and to
jack specifically.

The custom modes are not interoperable with anything else, nor are they
a part of the codec standard, but they do exist in the code for people
with very specialised needs in 'closed' applications, where the need for
oddball frame sizes strongly outweighs any other considerations of
interoperability, or codec performance (the latter being both in the
sense of processing resources *and* more importantly audio quality).


My understanding at present is that the primary (only?) reason that
netjack is using custom modes is so that it can use 64 sample frames
which shaves ~1ms of latency off the usual 2.5ms (120 sample) minimum
frame size for normal opus modes.  We didn't quite get to the bottom
of all of that before Robin had to leave, so at present my only
understanding of the reason for that is that "pro audio equipment"
can operate with lower latencies than normal sound cards which makes
this desirable.

What I still don't understand though is why if you are using Pro audio
equipment the degradation in audio quality that this would bring (which
is significant) would be acceptable for that use?  You'd need to stream
at much higher bitrates than normal to recover even some of that, and
even then there are many quality enhancements in the encoder that only
apply to the normal modes, which are completely bypassed in the custom
modes.  And even without those, quality will still suffer compared to
the more normal analysis frame sizes used by this codec, just by virtue
of the tiny window size.  Even 2.5ms frames have notably lower quality
than the default 20ms ones do.  Non-standard 1.3ms frames are at a
considerable disadvantage here for high fidelity reproduction.

The 'normal' latency of Opus is orders of magnitude lower than anything
which can even approach it for quality, but even it has both hands tied
behind its back when it only has 64 samples to work its magic on.

Which basically makes the question become: "If you are using Pro audio
equipment and ~1ms of latency does make a difference to you, then
wouldn't a lossless transport mode be more appropriate for that anyway?"


Which isn't exactly the original question that we need to answer here,
but it is relevant to that, since netjack is the only thing that I'm
aware of that's likely to want support for custom modes from the distro
packages.  So the question of whether it's actually gaining any real
benefit from this is the key to knowing whether we even need to consider
supporting custom modes in the distro in the foreseeable future. 

The upstream developers have reaffirmed that they definitely do not
want to enable the custom modes by default in what they release, so
even if we do override that here for the .debs, there'll still be a
question of our compatibility with other distros and users.


Re Jonas's remarks:

&gt; In my opinion the best option so far is for libopus to enable custom
&gt; modes: Primary aim in Debian is to enable most possible features - being
&gt; fastest possible has lower priority so can wait until done properly.
&gt;
&gt; ...and convenience code copies is explicitly discouraged in Policy, so
&gt; range far lower on the list!

I concur with this, which is why I revisited the question of whether
we would even need to with Robin.  And the other upstream developers
agree that should we really need to, enabling this for the packages
is probably the preferred option (unless we really can think of some
better way instead).

There isn't really a "wait until done properly" about this though,
the penalties are largely inherent in the extra complexity this adds.

Part of the catch here is that while enabling this will not break
ABI, disabling it again will, so this is very much a one-way decision
which I'd like to not make until we are certain there will be no
turning back from it, or second thoughts, or regrets over mistakes
that could be remedied now in better ways instead.

&gt; Ron, what do you think about the following?
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of using embedded copies in jackd1/2, let's build two flavours
&gt; of OPUS from a single source package.

We discussed this option upstream to try and find a solution that might
work like this, but it's not simple.  Mainly because the custom modes
are not a simple superset of the normal builds.  They add some API
functions, but it also changes the behaviour of some existing functions.

&gt; Just sketching now:
&gt; 
&gt; libopus0 will provide /usr/lib/libopus.so.0 (business as usual)
&gt; libopus-custom-0 will provide /usr/lib/libopus-custom.so.0

The big problem with this is that both of those will provide all of
the functions that libopus.so.0 does, only some of the symbols with
the same names will have different implementations in the -custom one.

Which means that when jack links to -custom, and jill links to -vanilla,
and then some high level audio app or desktop environment or whatever
links to both jack and jill ...   hilarity is likely to ensue.

&gt; In addition, we'll keep libopus-dev and introduce libopus-custom-dev
&gt; containing the additional files and a dependency on libopus-custom-0.
&gt; 
&gt; All packages will be co-installable, since no file conflict will occur.

There can be no file conflict, but there will be symbol conflicts.

&gt; In jackd1/2, we'll build-depend on libopus-custom-dev and link against
&gt; libopus-custom instead of libopus.
&gt; 
&gt; It's certainly a bit of work on your side (building two binary sets from
&gt; the same source). OTOH, at least CDBS supports flavours out of the box,
&gt; we use it in ardour to build ardour (generic), ardour-i686 (SSE) and
&gt; ardour-altivec.

I'm not worried about the work (it's not much), or being able to package
multiple flavours (I've done this before for various things too).

Mostly I'm worried that we don't make a decision that could later blow up
in our faces and/or be very difficult to unwind, for reasons that turn out
to never have been warranted at all.  And that we will be 'forking' away
incompatibly for other distros, at least for a while if not forever.

So right now I'm basically interested in 2 questions:

 - Can jack really make a case for needing this in a way that actually
   delivers real benefits to jack users.  (Robin has said that this is
   also 'complicated', but I still don't fully understand why yet).
   Or would it be better off only using Opus in cases where 2.5ms of
   latency is acceptable (or even more where quality is more important
   than the lowest possible latency) - and providing lossless transport
   where extreme low latency is required (which I know it already does).

 - And if the answer to the above is yes, the custom modes really are a
   clear advantage for some particular use case, what the least worst way
   to do that in the distro may be.


Good answers to all of my uncertainties above are most welcome :)
I would like to resolve this fairly quickly once we are all sure we
have a firm grip on the relevant facts and do actually know the best
result to be aiming for here.


  Thanks!
  Ron
