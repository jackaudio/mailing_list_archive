Subject:     [Jack-Devel] constant freezes with netadapter/audioadapter

hello everyone,
I am trying to get the soundcard on the client to work (using
"audioadapter") along with the net backend, and I also try the opposite,
i.e. to start with alsa backend and startup "netadapter".
both plugins load fine and they appear on the other jack end fine as well.

The problem is when I try to connect the adapter ports to the system ports.
qjackctl freezes.
I tried from the command line and jack_connect returns:

jack_connect netadapter:capture_1 system:playback_1
Cannot open jack_connect client
JACK server not running?


it dosn't look like it has been discussed  much.
System is slackware 14 43bits, jack2 is 1.9.9.5

Thank you in advance for your help.
