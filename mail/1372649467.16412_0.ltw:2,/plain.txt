Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] latest version of jack

absolutely NOT.

You can have only a single version of JACK installed at one time. You can
switch back and forth without any other changes, but you cannot have both
versions installed at the same time. This applies whether you are talking
about two different releases of (e.g.) jack2, or releases of jack1 and
jack2.
