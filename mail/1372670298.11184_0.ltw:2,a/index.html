&gt; My understanding of the background prior to that is that Robin had some
&gt; discussion with some of the developers at FOMS, who at the time suggested
&gt; the custom modes probably would be appropriate for the use described to
&gt; them.

correct. derf aka Tim Terriberry in this case.

[..]

&gt; The custom modes are not interoperable with anything else, nor are they
&gt; a part of the codec standard, but they do exist in the code for people
&gt; with very specialised needs in 'closed' applications, where the need for
&gt; oddball frame sizes strongly outweighs any other considerations of
&gt; interoperability, or codec performance (the latter being both in the
&gt; sense of processing resources *and* more importantly audio quality).

jack in particular was one of the use-cases for opus-devs to justify
custom modes.

&gt; My understanding at present is that the primary (only?) reason that
&gt; netjack is using custom modes is so that it can use 64 sample frames
&gt; which shaves ~1ms of latency off the usual 2.5ms (120 sample) minimum
&gt; frame size for normal opus modes.  We didn't quite get to the bottom
&gt; of all of that before Robin had to leave, so at present my only
&gt; understanding of the reason for that is that "pro audio equipment"
&gt; can operate with lower latencies than normal sound cards which makes
&gt; this desirable.

not quite.

netjack is using opus custom modes so that jack can use the same
period-size across the complete jack system.

Adding buffering on either side (sender + receiver) to align jack + opus
buffers will always result in additional latency.

For large jack buffersizes or long-distance communication that
additional latency may be negligible, but it still is more latency.

Furthermore, aligning non-audio jack-data (transport + MIDI) with sample
accuracy to those opus-audio-buffers is far from trivial.

It's not impossible, but it is quite complex because jack is not
designed to cater for that case.


&gt; What I still don't understand though is why if you are using Pro audio
&gt; equipment the degradation in audio quality that this would bring (which
&gt; is significant) would be acceptable for that use? 

a) because some users demand it :)
b) because celt is no longer available on most distros

low, fixed latency is most important.

There are countless solutions for high-quality streaming - where latency
and jitter is irrelevant, but basically only netjack that provides
synchroneous low latency.

[..]

&gt; Which basically makes the question become: "If you are using Pro audio
&gt; equipment and ~1ms of latency does make a difference to you, then
&gt; wouldn't a lossless transport mode be more appropriate for that anyway?"

on a LAN, yes lossless. Over Wifi it may make sense to compress lossy to
accommodate more channels. On WAN there are e.g. remote jam-sessions,
phone relays, live monitoring,.. - none of which requires high quality,
but all require fixed low latency.

[..]

&gt; The upstream developers have reaffirmed that they definitely do not
&gt; want to enable the custom modes by default in what they release, so
&gt; even if we do override that here for the .debs, there'll still be a
&gt; question of our compatibility with other distros and users.

yes, the solution for that would be to add opus as git-submodule to jack
and statically link netjack against it. That'd also accommodate windows,
OSX and *BSD builds of jackd.

[..]

&gt;  - Can jack really make a case for needing this in a way that actually
&gt;    delivers real benefits to jack users.  (Robin has said that this is
&gt;    also 'complicated', but I still don't fully understand why yet).

see above. Sample-sync alignment with other data-types is not easy.
Asynchronous (buffered) communication is orthogonal to everything else
in jack. It will likely be rejected upstream. jack does not aim to do
everything. JACK tries to address 95% and do that right and not care
about the last 5% edge-cases.

On top of of that, there are currently no volunteers to implement
"vanilla opus" on netjack2 (and also no volunteer to implement that in
netjack1). I was scratching my own itch with netjack2+opus. works for me.

The only case for non-custom modes would be:
 1) interoperability with other opus apps
 2) higher quality encoding

(1) is never going to work out. netjack consists of N audio-channels, M
midi-channels. Both include per-port latencies (min,max). And netjack
also comprises transport information (timecode, tempo, bar-beat-tick,
audio-frames per video-frame, etc). It is not a data stream that will be
consumed by non-jack.

(2) if a user chooses lossy encoding s/he does not really care about
quality anyway. jack's main features is no-copy zero-latency with local
clients, being able to include remote clients on the network that align
sample-sync and respond reliably is the main use-case.


ciao,
robin
