I've seen colliding symbols with ardour via indirect linking, and it's
really a PITA to diagnose.

But here it seems to be very unlikely: only the jack server links
against libopus(-custom), and this server is a standalone binary that's
not linking or linked to anything else.

All the clients link against libjack, and even if they do link against
libopus, they're not interfering with the server's libopus-custom, since
client-server communication is done via /dev/shm.

So I think we can ignore the symbol aspect for all practical cases.
(Correct me if I'm wrong).
