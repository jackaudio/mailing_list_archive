&gt; &gt; My understanding of the background prior to that is that Robin had some
&gt; &gt; discussion with some of the developers at FOMS, who at the time suggested
&gt; &gt; the custom modes probably would be appropriate for the use described to
&gt; &gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; correct. derf aka Tim Terriberry in this case.

Right, and it was Tim who ran through the math in the IRC discussion to
point out that this might not have been the best suggestion after all.

&gt; &gt; The custom modes are not interoperable with anything else, nor are they
&gt; &gt; a part of the codec standard, but they do exist in the code for people
&gt; &gt; with very specialised needs in 'closed' applications, where the need for
&gt; &gt; oddball frame sizes strongly outweighs any other considerations of
&gt; &gt; interoperability, or codec performance (the latter being both in the
&gt; &gt; sense of processing resources *and* more importantly audio quality).
&gt; 
&gt; jack in particular was one of the use-cases for opus-devs to justify
&gt; custom modes.

Greg was probably the one who most often raised oddball cases that might
use this, but even he was now scratching his head somewhat at what you
are actually trying to achieve with using it for netjack as you are.

Which is why I wanted to try to get to the bottom of your rationale here.

&gt; &gt; My understanding at present is that the primary (only?) reason that
&gt; &gt; netjack is using custom modes is so that it can use 64 sample frames
&gt; &gt; which shaves ~1ms of latency off the usual 2.5ms (120 sample) minimum
&gt; &gt; frame size for normal opus modes.  We didn't quite get to the bottom
&gt; &gt; of all of that before Robin had to leave, so at present my only
&gt; &gt; understanding of the reason for that is that "pro audio equipment"
&gt; &gt; can operate with lower latencies than normal sound cards which makes
&gt; &gt; this desirable.
&gt; 
&gt; not quite.
&gt; 
&gt; netjack is using opus custom modes so that jack can use the same
&gt; period-size across the complete jack system.

What gets to pick the period here?  Even custom modes still limit you to
some discrete number of choices, it isn't continuously variable, so there
will surely still be cases where some part of the system needs to adapt
to suit other parts if this is to be true, won't there?

&gt; Adding buffering on either side (sender + receiver) to align jack + opus
&gt; buffers will always result in additional latency.
&gt; 
&gt; For large jack buffersizes or long-distance communication that
&gt; additional latency may be negligible, but it still is more latency.

You realise that we are talking about a latency that is equivalent to
moving your head approximately 15 inches from your speakers, right?

Or in the case of a 'jam session', two players standing about a foot
from each other ...  with their instruments held a foot from each
others chins.  If they are any further apart than that, in the same
room, then the latency difference that you are worrying over here
becomes insignificant by comparison.

If they stand a guitar length apart and put headphones on, even the
normal mode of opus will get the sound to their ears faster than the
air between them would.

It doesn't take large buffer sizes or long distances to make this
negligible.  We're not talking coarse yak hairs here, it's the finest
angora.

&gt; Furthermore, aligning non-audio jack-data (transport + MIDI) with sample
&gt; accuracy to those opus-audio-buffers is far from trivial.

Elastic stores really are trivial.  So I'm still not really sure what
showstopper complexity you are worried about there.


&gt; &gt; What I still don't understand though is why if you are using Pro audio
&gt; &gt; equipment the degradation in audio quality that this would bring (which
&gt; &gt; is significant) would be acceptable for that use? 
&gt; 
&gt; a) because some users demand it :)

What exactly are users demanding here?  They surely aren't demanding that
members of the band stand on each others toes and play their guitars with
their teeth.  If they want to use oxygen free copper that's fine, but what
_real_ gain are they demanding to get here?  That's the important question
we need to answer.

&gt; b) because celt is no longer available on most distros

It arguably should have never been available on them in the first place :)
But that was a learning experience for us too!

&gt; low, fixed latency is most important.
&gt; 
&gt; There are countless solutions for high-quality streaming - where latency
&gt; and jitter is irrelevant, but basically only netjack that provides
&gt; synchroneous low latency.

You can still have low latency with standard opus modes.  If you take one
small step toward your speaker it can even be lower than the custom mode
you are currently using :)

&gt; &gt; Which basically makes the question become: "If you are using Pro audio
&gt; &gt; equipment and ~1ms of latency does make a difference to you, then
&gt; &gt; wouldn't a lossless transport mode be more appropriate for that anyway?"
&gt; 
&gt; on a LAN, yes lossless. Over Wifi it may make sense to compress lossy to
&gt; accommodate more channels.

On WIFI it's pointless to talk about even the highest latency modes of
opus being a problem.  The potential (and common) latencies there are
orders of magnitude larger.

&gt; On WAN there are e.g. remote jam-sessions,
&gt; phone relays, live monitoring,.. - none of which requires high quality,
&gt; but all require fixed low latency.

And these are all _exactly_ the applications that the normal modes of
opus were specifically designed for.  They are point 1. of the chartered
objectives for the standardisation work that took place.

&gt; &gt; The upstream developers have reaffirmed that they definitely do not
&gt; &gt; want to enable the custom modes by default in what they release, so
&gt; &gt; even if we do override that here for the .debs, there'll still be a
&gt; &gt; question of our compatibility with other distros and users.
&gt; 
&gt; yes, the solution for that would be to add opus as git-submodule to jack
&gt; and statically link netjack against it. That'd also accommodate windows,
&gt; OSX and *BSD builds of jackd.

Until someone links an application to both jack and another lib using the
normal opus builds.  At which point kaboom?

Doing this correctly and safely really isn't easier than a simple elastic
store that lets you adapt any frame size to any other.  Or than just
picking 2.5ms as your minimum latency for lossy modes.


&gt; &gt;  - Can jack really make a case for needing this in a way that actually
&gt; &gt;    delivers real benefits to jack users.  (Robin has said that this is
&gt; &gt;    also 'complicated', but I still don't fully understand why yet).
&gt; 
&gt; see above. Sample-sync alignment with other data-types is not easy.

Is is, really.  You can write a trivial wrapper around the normal opus
I/O methods iff you really need to adapt to something &lt; 2.5ms.  But it's
still not clear what less than 2.5ms gains you except poorer audio and
higher bitrates.

&gt; Asynchronous (buffered) communication is orthogonal to everything else
&gt; in jack. It will likely be rejected upstream. jack does not aim to do
&gt; everything. JACK tries to address 95% and do that right and not care
&gt; about the last 5% edge-cases.

An elastic store does not make this asynchronous.

&gt; On top of of that, there are currently no volunteers to implement
&gt; "vanilla opus" on netjack2 (and also no volunteer to implement that in
&gt; netjack1). I was scratching my own itch with netjack2+opus. works for me.

Well, there's currently no volunteers to make building with the custom
modes sane and compatible between distros either.  And I'm pretty sure
that fixing netjack would be easier than that.

Scratching your own itch is fine, but we're talking here about what is
suitable for a distro release.  And one way or another, what you've
currently got is going to need some work to be suitable for that.

&gt; The only case for non-custom modes would be:
&gt;  1) interoperability with other opus apps
&gt;  2) higher quality encoding
&gt; 
&gt; (1) is never going to work out. netjack consists of N audio-channels, M
&gt; midi-channels. Both include per-port latencies (min,max). And netjack
&gt; also comprises transport information (timecode, tempo, bar-beat-tick,
&gt; audio-frames per video-frame, etc). It is not a data stream that will be
&gt; consumed by non-jack.

And it's also not incompatible with using an elastic store.  I'd be kind
of surprised if at least some parts of this chain don't already have one,
whether that is in your code or not.

&gt; (2) if a user chooses lossy encoding s/he does not really care about
&gt; quality anyway. jack's main features is no-copy zero-latency with local
&gt; clients, being able to include remote clients on the network that align
&gt; sample-sync and respond reliably is the main use-case.

You can't have either of no-copy or zero-latency if you're going through
a windowed codec as your transport stream.  Laws of physics and all that.
You can still however care about quality.  Opus at just ~128kbs is pretty
much transparent for all but the hardest audio, to even the best of ears.
But not with 1.3ms packets.  If a user cares about lossy, then they have
more to gain from the bitrate improvement which would come with this than
from an imperceptible change in the latency.

All the ideals you have here are wonderful, and I don't want to discourage
you from them, or limit you in any real way from achieving them to the
closest degree that you can.

But I am asking you to do the (fairly simple) math to quantify the _actual_
gains which people might see, and explain how they justify the extra work,
complexity, and potential for real problems that they will cost.


If all you're left with at the end of that is "this was easier to port
from what we did for celt", then that really is the bug we should be fixing
and it really shouldn't be hard to fix it, or nearly as ugly as any of the
alternatives that I'm seeing so far, once everything is added up.


I'm not taking any options off the table here yet, but the more we talk
about this, the less I see what tangible advantage the custom modes are
really giving you here.  They really are meant only for the most oddball
of exceptions, and what you're doing here really isn't that sort of odd.
At least from what I'm able to understand from your descriptions so far.

I'm willing to accept I'm missing something here still, but I'd like to
know what it is before we open a can of worms we can't close, only to
find out that we really never needed to at all.


  Cheers,
  Ron
