Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows XP - unable to load winmme driver

Hi Dan,

It seems that the rtpMIDI for linux drivers are working in RaspberryPi
but are not generally available for other distributions (yet) :(

So the next answer to look at is the Lan MIDI available via JAVA that
is integrated with jOrgan (which runs on Windows, OS-X and Linux), or
the ipMIDI (Windows) / multimidicast (Linux) or QmidiNet (Linux)

Kind regards,
GrahamG
