Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows XP - unable to load winmme driver

Thanks Graham. I've tried a number of combinations of the latter, but
haven't been able to get any communication (even though I can get Jack to
return audio to the master successfully). I'm going to try the jOrgan/Java
approach to see if that works.
