&gt; &gt; So I'm still not really sure what
&gt; &gt; showstopper complexity you are worried about there.
&gt; 
&gt; Sample accurate alignment of buffered netjack streams with the rest of
&gt; jack. updating port-latencies,.. Sounds easy, but it's not.

You do know that you've _already_ got to deal with this if you care about
it when using Opus right?  The first few samples out of the decoder aren't
the first few samples that you put into the encoder, whatever mode you use.

And yeah, I'm not saying it's a one-liner, but it's not squaring the circle
either, it is a fairly normal part of anything dealing with windowed codecs.

&gt; The realshowstopper there is lack of manpower.
&gt; No one volunteered to implement it.

Ok, that's fine.  There are no answers here that don't involve work that
still needs to be done, which hasn't been done yet and that someone will
need to do if they want this to happen.

There's still no answer to a sensible way to distribute -custom builds
in a shared environment yet either.  Upstream is very much focussed on
just the standardised modes, and custom is still a hack, that people
with total control over a closed system can use if they really need it,
and if they are prepared to deal with taking full responsibility for
anything that may get broken with it (or be completely untested) over
subsequent releases.  That's not really a state of affairs that we want
if we're going to expose it in general purpose distro libraries (either
from the libopus package or embedded in other public libs).  Sooner or
later some change will bite people badly.  So this needs to be resolved
if there ever is anything that's to go in the distro that uses them.
But while there isn't, it can also wait until more urgent things are
completed too, and everything just settles down a bit in general and
stops changing as rapidly as it currently is.

What I'm concerned about here is that we figure out what the _best_
answer is, so that when someone does have time to do it, they don't
waste it chasing up the wrong tree.

Right now, it really is sounding like the best answer for what we have
at present is for someone to look at the jack code and do the work that
is needed there, to account for the initial padding and window latency.
If that's the real showstopper, that's what people should focus on
fixing first.

I'm still open to suggestions for good ways to manage the how we might
enable custom problem, but that seems orthogonal to also fixing jack
in the way that will work with best results there, and less pressing
until there is a definite need for it.

  Cheers,
  Ron
