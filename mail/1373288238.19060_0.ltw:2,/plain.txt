Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Rust bindings

Hi everybody,
   For my weekend hobby project, I have begun working on  Rust bindings for
the Jack API.  So far the crate only supports the bare minimum set of
functionality that I have required for audio playback(creating jack
clients, ringbuffers etc).  If anyone has suggestions regarding either
additional functionality they believe I should support OR  stylistic coding
issues, please chime in and let me know what's up.  I was tentatively
planning on tackling MIDI next, but I'm sure there are holes in the audio
API I should address.

Thanks,
