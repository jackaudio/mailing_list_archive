Hi!

Debian is at gcc-4.8.1 and libc 2.17, and we haven't received such bug
reports, neither in the past nor recently.

Which more or less eliminates toolchain issues. Or we patch/configure
our toolchain in a certain way that prevents the bug from showing up.

That said, I'm not aware of similar bugs reported by Fedora or SuSE
users, thus leaving your Slackware installation as the only occurrence
for now.

I vaguely remember a discussion on jack-devel and Paul saying "You must
never ever rely on pthread cancellation, it's broken." Maybe you're just
seeing this.

Or maybe your toolchain got some weird patching. There is an easy way to
figure out: borrow stuff from Debian. You could download Debian's
libffado:

   http://packages.debian.org/experimental/libffado2


Last not least: Check the svn for the commit that fixed a similar issue
we had some months ago. Patch was by David Henningsson from Canonical, I
guess it was svn r1999.
