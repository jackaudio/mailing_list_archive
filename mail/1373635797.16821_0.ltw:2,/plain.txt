A web search was surprisingly thin on results.  The general gist of Paul's
point (according to the only post I could find quickly) appears to stem from
the significant restrictions that are placed on the thread functions being
called.  If those functions are doing purely computational tasks with no
system calls then you can get away with it.  If system calls are involved
then all bets are apparently off because the rollback can't be done reliably.

In the present case, the segfault occurs in the _Unwind_Resume() function
having interrupted SystemTimeSource::SleepUsecRelative().  The latter
function definitely consists of syscalls, which would make the entire thread
unsuitable for pthread_cancel().  Add to this that the watchdog threads are
set with a cancellation type of PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS (which places
even more restrictions on the thread) and we have a significant issue.  Note
however that changing this to the more conventional PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED
doesn't fix the problem.

Removing the calls to SleepUsecRelative() and replacing them with a crude
loop delay resolves the segfault for me, which pretty much proves the point.
This all makes sense except for the fact that a segfault has taken so long
to appear due to all this - and even not it's only affecting a specific
distribution.  We must have just been lucky.

I'm working on a patch to fix this.  We can't just Stop() the PosixThreads
because the sleep time can be quite lengthy.  Libffado would therefore take
quite a few seconds to clean up typically, which is inconvenient.  I expect
the solution to involve some combination of Stop() and pthread_signal() (to
interrupt a system call and hopefully speed up the thread exit) but I'm
still working through various issues (for example, the global nature of
signal handlers, even if execution context is by thread).

As far as I can tell, only the watchdog uses pthread_cancel() on its
threads; all other FFADO threads are stopped using PoxixThread::Stop(). 
Therefore this problem only affects the watchdog object.
