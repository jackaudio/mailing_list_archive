Say again? Does this mean that jack2 mlocks the entire process memory,
including giant GUI libraries like QT and GTK? Or is some other mechanism
in place? Are clients perhaps expected to lock their own critical memory in
JACK2? If so, I think that's a reasonable, but people certainly need to be
made aware of it--maybe the JACK API should even include a wrapper function
for the purpose.
