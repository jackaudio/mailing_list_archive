&gt;&gt; AFAIR --unlock was never really implemented in jack2

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I've just upgraded my debian/sid system, that include a jackdmp update
&gt;&gt; to version 1.9.10 (from 1.9.8)
&gt;&gt; &gt; Usually I use the -u option --unlock, but now jackd refuse to start
&gt;&gt; with that option enabled. It say's
&gt;&gt; &gt;  unknown option character
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I just wonder, is the -u --unlock commandline option removed from
&gt;&gt; jackdmp 1.9.10?
&gt;&gt; &gt; If so, is there a special reason for that?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Or is it debian specific?
&gt;&gt; &gt; However, the -u option is still mention in the debian man page, so
&gt;&gt; there is at least a bug somewhere which needs to be addressed and solved.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; greets
&gt;&gt; &gt; hermann
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Say again? Does this mean that jack2 mlocks the entire process memory,
&gt; including giant GUI libraries like QT and GTK?
&gt;

jack1 has a whitelist of things to not lock. i thought that jack2 had
inherited this. my recollection is that the lock/unlock option only affects
the global question "do i pin memory to physical RAM". even if it is turned
on, libjack will try (certainly for jack1 and probably for jack2) to unlock
stuff related to X and GUIs.

note that unix provides no clean way to do this, so don't expect to be
impressed by the way this is implemented.



&gt; Or is some other mechanism in place? Are clients perhaps expected to lock
&gt; their own critical memory in JACK2?
&gt;

from what i could see of the original change, it almost appeared accidental
that the lock/unlock options were removed, because none of the
implementation was modified. there has certainly never been an expectation
that the client should take care of this.
