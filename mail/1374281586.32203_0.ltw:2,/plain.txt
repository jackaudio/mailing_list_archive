jack1 has a whitelist of things to not lock. i thought that jack2 had
inherited this. my recollection is that the lock/unlock option only affects
the global question "do i pin memory to physical RAM". even if it is turned
on, libjack will try (certainly for jack1 and probably for jack2) to unlock
stuff related to X and GUIs.

note that unix provides no clean way to do this, so don't expect to be
impressed by the way this is implemented.

from what i could see of the original change, it almost appeared accidental
that the lock/unlock options were removed, because none of the
implementation was modified. there has certainly never been an expectation
that the client should take care of this.
