Using packed data structures is a common approach for network protocols. Main 
purpose is not saving memory space or transmission bandwidth, but rather 
preserving compatibility among various different architectures, i.e. an amd64 
server communicating with an arm32 client. Non packed C(++) data struct 
declarations might result in actually different data structures on different 
systems, since the compiler usually tries to optimize the members of the 
structure to be memory aligned for fast access (i.e. adding non used bytes in 
between members), which however is dependent to the word size of the system.

I doubt that the crash you got is caused by packed data structures. Disabling 
the packed attributes most probably just moved the symptoms.
