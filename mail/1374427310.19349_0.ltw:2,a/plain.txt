Well, the Nexus 7 provides an ARMv7 CPU with hardware supported non-aligned 
access. But on the other hand, I just figured that there are still 
instructions like double word (64 bit) access which raise an alignment fault 
(section A3.2.1 in the ARM Architecture Reference Manual). So far I thought 
those alignment faults would be caught & processed correctly by the OS 
(similar like software implemented unaligned simple loads/saves on ARMv6 
systems), but I must admit I am not sure if that's always the case.
