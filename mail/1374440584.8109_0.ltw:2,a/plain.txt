Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack on a Nexus 7

Just to clarify, the bus error occurred in the initialization of
engine->control->frame_timer in jack_engine_new. I apologize that that I
lost track of the exact line of code.after I diagnosed the problem as an
ARM alignment issue and corrected it by unpacking the structure.
