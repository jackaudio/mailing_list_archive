Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Hardware jack + linux

Hello folks,

first of all my appologies, since this is a bit OT, but I need some 
information about hardware which works fluently in a linux/jack/ardour 
environment and I hope to find some experts here.

So here's my issue:
I'm doing some recording/mixing for a bunch of local musicians; at the moment 
I'm using a Mackie Onyx Blackjack as interface. This is just fine, since the 
recordings are mostly guitar and vocals and I can add additional tracks by 
overdubbing.

But now I'm facing the task to record a band with drums and the Blackjack is 
not suitable to fit my needs for this task anymore.

I was thinking about an interface with PCIe bus and at least 8 (better would 
be 16) channels input and at least 4 channels back for monitoring. I know of 
digital mixers having the ability to directly connect the input channels to a 
PC, but I don't know how well they work in my environment. Another thing I 
know of are some RME soundcards (I only found cards with 8 channels) which 
should work well with alsa, but I don't know how well they work with 
jackd/ardour. 

Is anybody here having some experience in linux audio recording who can give 
me some hints what exactly to look for?

Ah, forgot to mention: a samplerate of 96kbit would be preferred, but at the 
moment I could live with 48kbit, too.

Thanks a lot and greetings from Germany.
