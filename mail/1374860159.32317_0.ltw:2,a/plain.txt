Hi Jan,

RME sound cards generally perform really really well under Linux. I've had a couple (an old Hammerfall 9636, a HDSP9632 and a HDSP9652) and they've been great. None of their PCI/PCIe offerings, however, feature microphone preamps, and their higher-channel-count cards tend to be all-digital. As such, to record a drum kit + extras, I suggest that you will need an external multichannel mic preamp and A/D box. Many products exist which do both jobs, some with ADAT I/O and others with AES/EBU I/O.

ADAT tends to be cheaper than AES, and each ADAT channel transports 8 audio channels instead of 2. But it is limited to 48kHz operation (some kit will do something called S/MUX, whereby a 96kHz audio channel can be transported in place of two 48kHz ones, so that an ADAT channel will transport 4 audio channels at the high rate). At the cheapest end, a Behringer ADA8000 will give you 8 microphone preamps and A/D conversion (to ADAT), and 8 D/A converters (from ADAT) with balanced analogue outputs. But, of course, limited to 48lHz. Higher-end ADAT units exist all over the place (and RME do make some as well), so have a read around.

If you go with an ADAT converter, you'll almost certainly be well-served by either the RME HDSPe AIO (1x ADAT I/O + 1 AES/EBU I/O + some analogue extras) or the HDSPe RayDAT (4x ADAT I/O only). Only the latter will be capable of getting 16, or even 8, channels at 24/96 over the ADAT.

If you go with an AES/EBU converter, the natural choice of card would be the RME HDSPe AES, which features 8 AES/EBU digital inputs and outputs (so, 16 channels each way, all at up to 24/192).


I'm sure many manufacturers' sound cards will work well for your application, but under Linux, the RMEs have a great reputation.
