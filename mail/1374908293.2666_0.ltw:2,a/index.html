&gt; Hello folks,
&gt;
&gt; first of all my appologies, since this is a bit OT, but I need some
&gt; information about hardware which works fluently in a linux/jack/ardour
&gt; environment and I hope to find some experts here.
&gt;
&gt; So here's my issue:
&gt; I'm doing some recording/mixing for a bunch of local musicians; at the moment
&gt; I'm using a Mackie Onyx Blackjack as interface. This is just fine, since the
&gt; recordings are mostly guitar and vocals and I can add additional tracks by
&gt; overdubbing.
&gt;
&gt; But now I'm facing the task to record a band with drums and the Blackjack is
&gt; not suitable to fit my needs for this task anymore.
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking about an interface with PCIe bus and at least 8 (better would
&gt; be 16) channels input and at least 4 channels back for monitoring. I know of
&gt; digital mixers having the ability to directly connect the input channels to a
&gt; PC, but I don't know how well they work in my environment. Another thing I
&gt; know of are some RME soundcards (I only found cards with 8 channels) which
&gt; should work well with alsa, but I don't know how well they work with
&gt; jackd/ardour.
&gt;
&gt; Is anybody here having some experience in linux audio recording who can give
&gt; me some hints what exactly to look for?
&gt;
&gt; Ah, forgot to mention: a samplerate of 96kbit would be preferred, but at the
&gt; moment I could live with 48kbit, too.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks a lot and greetings from Germany.
&gt;
Hi Jan

a similar discussion is going on at the Fedora music list with a lot of 
success stories [1]. I also live in Germany and most cards mentioned in 
this thread are available from thomann.de. Good luck and please let us 
know how you get on.

For firewire cards, checking your device against the FFADO support 
matrix is your best bet [2]. For USB, PCI(e) etc the ALSA device matrix [3].

good luck!
