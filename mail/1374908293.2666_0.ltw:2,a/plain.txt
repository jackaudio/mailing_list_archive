Hi Jan

a similar discussion is going on at the Fedora music list with a lot of 
success stories [1]. I also live in Germany and most cards mentioned in 
this thread are available from thomann.de. Good luck and please let us 
know how you get on.

For firewire cards, checking your device against the FFADO support 
matrix is your best bet [2]. For USB, PCI(e) etc the ALSA device matrix [3].

good luck!
