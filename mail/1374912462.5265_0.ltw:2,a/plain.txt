PCI(e) RME is a safe bet, but as noted, cards tend to be all digital
these days, so you need an external ADC/DAC. Which is the better setup
anyway, since it decouples conversion from getting the signal into
whatever box you use. IOW, if you switch to a different machine, at
least your converters can be reused.

Your options are RME RayDAT, RME MADI and RME AES(32). If you go MADI,
the Marian Seraph cards might be an option, too. Linux drivers by
faberman, and a bit less heavy on the price tag.

Speaking of which: If you don't want to spend a fortune on converters
and you don't need analogue gains, check out directout.eu's andiamo.
You could wire it to an anlogue 32in/32out console. Of course, if you
only need 16ins, the RayDAT and two ADAT converters would still be
cheaper.



Cheers
