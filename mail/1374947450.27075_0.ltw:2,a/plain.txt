I cannot speak highly enough of the RME HDSP 9652. I want a RayDat but 
can't afford one yet.

The ADA8000's go bad after a couple of years in my experience, or with 
any degree of mishandling. I found a couple of refurbished Presonus 
Digimax FS preamps that are much better; unfortunately they're not 
making them anymore.

If money were no object, I'd get a MADIface and a bunch of Micstacy 
preamps and some high-end DACs... but money is an object, so :-(
