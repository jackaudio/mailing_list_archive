I use the Behringer X32 with jack all the time, it works great. Since 
jack also handles midi you can do control over the same jack connection. 
I'm even running using netjack to do remote control with a little 8 
channel fader pack pluged into a laptop running netjack. I can even run 
the studio monitor over netjack so I can do soling from the remote 
location. Having both midi as well as audio in jack is quite a powerful 
combination.
