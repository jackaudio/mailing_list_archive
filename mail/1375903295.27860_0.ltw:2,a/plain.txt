Subject:     [Jack-Devel] get_number_of_xruns

Hey,

what do you think of adding a function to report the number of xruns to the
API?

I would propose:

    int jack_get_number_of_xruns (jack_client_t * client);
    void jack_reset_number_of_xruns (jack_client_t * client);

which echoes the existing functions from statistics.h:

    float jack_get_max_delayed_usecs (jack_client_t * client)
    void jack_reset_max_delayed_usecs(jack_client_t * client)

I recently made functions to report these two statistics for mod-host and
actually pulled in jack2 so I could use JackAtomic.h.

See
https://github.com/kasbah/mod-host/commit/5ab81dc54f6bbe1f9ffeddecdb5b95477359d8d3

Also, any comments about the code in general and the use of atomic
operations are appreciated.

Cheers,

Kaspar
