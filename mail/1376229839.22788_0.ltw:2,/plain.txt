You should know that almost all audio software on almost every platform
these days using floating point. Even platforms that used to use fixed
point (e.g. protools DSP boxes) now use floating point.

Adding a new data type to JACK is not particularly hard if it is intended
only for client-to-client communication. Adding a new data type to JACK
that involves the backends is a major undertaking.

You really should try to get over your attachment to integers - they are
fundamentally inappropriate for working with audio, something it has taken
the industry 10-20 years to realize but is now accepted by almost everyone.
