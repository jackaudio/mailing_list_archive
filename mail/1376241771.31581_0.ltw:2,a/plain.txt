Subject:     [Jack-Devel] starting jack from an ssh session - dbus problem

hello everyone,
I am on a ubuntustudio64 - 13.04 system.
I would like to be able to start the jack daemon from an ssh on occasions.
I stumble upon DBUS though.

nass@starkill:~$ jackd -S -dalsa -dhw:1,0 -r44100 -p128 -n2
jackdmp 1.9.10

Failed to connect to session bus for device reservation Unable to

jackd: ../dbus/reserve.c:391: rd_acquire: Assertion `0' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)


is there a switch to disable dbus? can I (and should I) compile a version
of jack in another folder without dbus and run this instead?

Thank you for your help
