Reading the documentation, it doesn't appear that there's a command-line 
switch to disable dbus support. I didn't check the source code, though, 
so there may be one that's just undocumented.

Since you're running Ubuntu Studio, I'm guessing you have X running. 
That is, the machine on which you're trying to run JACK has a graphical 
interface. You just don't have DISPLAY set because your shell is being 
started by sshd and not in the process tree of a graphical session. If 
you have a logged in session under X you should be able to connect to it 
by setting DISPLAY yourself:
     $ export DISPLAY=:0.1

If that doesn't help, or if you don't have an active X session, you can 
start the dbus daemon manually:
     $ dbus-daemon --session

Once you have the dbus daemon running JACK should no longer need X to 
auto-start it (I think). For more information on dbus-daemon see:

http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/en/man1/dbus-daemon.1.html
