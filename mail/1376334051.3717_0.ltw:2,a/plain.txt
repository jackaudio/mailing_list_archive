Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] ASIO i/o Latency functionality?

I see, I'm using jack to connect two or more asio capable DAW applications ( ProTools, bidule, & sonar). Gluing them together with the jackroute ASIO driver. Jack is also allowing me to get around the ProTools limitation of only allowing access to the first 32 sequential input/outputs of your hardware interface, and the lack of VST support . Each Jackroute instance seems to introduce the system buffer latency without compensation. So I was experimenting with the latency offset options. The ultimate goal is just to be able to track a live instrument and have it appear in time on the timeline without manually compensating. I don't monitor through software so high latencies are fine.
