Hi,

addtional remarks are perhaps interesting. If I'm running jackd under a
specific user and other users are in the group
of this jackd user, there are still connection problems. The reason is that
the group of the jackd user isn't the primary group
of that specific user and the client application - like qjackctl - creates a
server socket, which isn't accessible by the
jackd daemon (I'am regarding a debian environment here). Therefore "umask
0000" also works in such a situation more or less . Beside the assumption
that this is a conceptual problem, a simple solution could be: 

JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER=jackd 

Setting the environment variable to the group of the jackd daemon. According
to the patches handling the  JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER environment variable it
is not very difficult to change the ownership of the server-socket file to
that group and the access rights 0770 - posix/JackSocket.cpp.

Another variant:
Create a subdirectory /run/shm/jackd (debian) with the jackd permissions and
"chmod g+s /run/shm/jackd". All
files created in that directory will get the right ownership but the
permissions 0770 for server sockets are still necessary.

Perhaps it's better to provide the idea than a patch in this situation
because of a lack of experiences.

Cheers
Matthias
