Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] ASIO i/o Latency functionality?

JACK isn't going to export any of that information to ASIO, as far as I
know, because I am fairly certain that portaudio provides no way to do so.

Despite the steadily growing number of users of JACK on windows, there has
been an almost complete lack of developers for that platform getting
involved in the project. It would be fantastic if we had a "real" ASIO
backend and/or a "real" WDM/winRT backend for windows. But that is not
going to happen without someone who really knows and cares about windows
stepping up to do the work, and as far I know, nobody has expressed any
interest in doing this sort of thing.
