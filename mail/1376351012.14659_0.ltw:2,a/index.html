&gt; Despite the steadily growing number of users of JACK on windows, there

I'm decidedly interested in working with JACK on Windows. You may have 
seen the earlier question from me about how the JACK build process for 
the official Windows installers works. I had assumed that using 
PortAudio was a design choice and that native Windows drivers were not 
wanted. I've been trying unsuccessfully to get WASAPI exclusive mode 
working through PortAudio and would be delighted to contribute a native 
driver for it.

I have a couple other projects I need to get out of the way first, but I 
hope to resume working with JACK in the next month or so. I'll keep the 
list apprised of how things go.
