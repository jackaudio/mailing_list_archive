I'm decidedly interested in working with JACK on Windows. You may have 
seen the earlier question from me about how the JACK build process for 
the official Windows installers works. I had assumed that using 
PortAudio was a design choice and that native Windows drivers were not 
wanted. I've been trying unsuccessfully to get WASAPI exclusive mode 
working through PortAudio and would be delighted to contribute a native 
driver for it.

I have a couple other projects I need to get out of the way first, but I 
hope to resume working with JACK in the next month or so. I'll keep the 
list apprised of how things go.
