Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Windows compilation - me too

Hi Amir,

MSVC++ is supported for some parts of the JACK for Windows code base,
as I use it for compiling the drivers to link to in Fluidsynth for
Windows.

I would certainly support your efforts to document and get a windows
'waf' build chain created. If you create the steps I can follow them
and provide feedback. I'm not a programmer, but a user who has learned
enough to compile...

Kind regards,
GrahamG
