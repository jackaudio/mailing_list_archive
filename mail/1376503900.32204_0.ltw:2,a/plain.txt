i,

sorry if this is not the right list.

is this supposed to work: i have a jack server running on ubuntu 12.04
which plays back locally just fine. i then do

> jack_netsource -H nmba.local -i 2 -o 0 -I 0 -O 0 -n 10
Not Connected

on the slave machine nmba (mac os 10.8) i start

> jackd -R -d netone  -I 0 -O 0 -n 10
jackdmp 1.9.10

JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10
NetOne driver started
AutoConfig Override !!!
AutoConfig Override: Master JACK sample rate = 96000
AutoConfig Override: Master JACK period size is 256
AutoConfig Override: capture_channels_midi = 0
AutoConfig Override: playback_channels_audio = 2
AutoConfig Override: playback_channels_midi = 0
MTU is set to 1400 bytes
netxruns... duration: 2ms

also, the master says Connected.

but playback does not happen. instead i get many xruns like this on
the slave:

JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
JackEngine::XRun: client = REAPER was not finished, state = Running

i tried both with 96kHz, 256 cycles latency on the master and with
48kHz, 1024 cycles.

this is over a wireless N LAN. roundtrip latency for ping between
master and slave is 5 ms on average.

can this ever work?

(also tried netjack2, but that keeps waiting for a master ...)

thanks for any hints!

n.
