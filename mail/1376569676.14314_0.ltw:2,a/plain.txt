Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Stopping jack from callback

Hi all,

I'm counting how many times I have been in the process_callback and I would
like to stop immediately after the, say, 100th visit.

At the moment I increment a variable and a while loop in the main function
checks it every second. The problem is that jack keeps going to the
callback until I check and see that the variable has gone above 100. So I
may get into the callback 103, 114, or something else, times depending on
my buffer length.

Some code says more than a thousand lines of words:
...
int process (jack_nframes_t nframes, void *arg) {
   DPOAE *dpoae = (DPOAE *)arg;
   dpoae->m++;
}
...
int main (void) {
   ...
   jack_set_process_callback (client, process, &dpoae);
   ...
   while(dpoae.m<100) sleep (1);
   jack_client_close (client);
   ...
}

And this code does _not_ do what I want. What is the right way to make it
stop right after the 100th call of process.

Best, Anders
