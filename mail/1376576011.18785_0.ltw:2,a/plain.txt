Nope. JACK does its audio thing, and threading is left to the client. I've
been digging around in RT safe threading mechanisms for audio programs for
a while now... and decided on one system that works for me.

Tutorial style code for passing "Event" classes through a ringbuffer:

More in-depth search for the right method of RT messaging / memory handling:

Also I'm collecting audio programming example code using JACK / linux in
the following repo:
