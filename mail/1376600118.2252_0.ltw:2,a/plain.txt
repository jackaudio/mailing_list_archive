Its not a problem if you are purely writing in one thread and purely
reading in the other. When you increment in one thread (read+write) and
read in the other you might get the usual problems. But if you are okay
with a certain uncertainty, even incrementing in one thread and pure
reading in the other thread will not be bad.
Problems only start to arise when you want to write from more then one
thread into a single variable...
