&gt;  But let's put that aside as well. What is your opinion on trying to move
&gt;&gt; the windows build process to 'waf' as well? And in the process of doing
&gt;&gt; this transition, I will also document all the necessary compilation
&gt;&gt; steps (which is currently lacking) /or the sake of future generations.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm very much in favor of getting the waf build working, either under
&gt; MinGW+MSYS or Cygwin with the MinGW cross toolchain. If waf supports
&gt; building under Windows natively with MSVC++ that would be fine too. Any of
&gt; those three will give us a nice, repeatable build environment.
&gt;
&gt;
There were some patches committed to the jack2 repository a few weeks ago
that support building with the MinGW compiler using waf. I have been using
them for a while to cross compile jack2 from linux. I have not tried using
waf to compile jack2 on windows before but after mucking about in cygwin
for a bit this morning I believe it should be fairly straight forward with
the right setup. I had trouble getting portaudio configured/installed so I
gave up on it for the moment.

I imagine it would be much easier just to use Code::Blocks and have a guide
if there is additional configuration required etc.
