There were some patches committed to the jack2 repository a few weeks ago
that support building with the MinGW compiler using waf. I have been using
them for a while to cross compile jack2 from linux. I have not tried using
waf to compile jack2 on windows before but after mucking about in cygwin
for a bit this morning I believe it should be fairly straight forward with
the right setup. I had trouble getting portaudio configured/installed so I
gave up on it for the moment.

I imagine it would be much easier just to use Code::Blocks and have a guide
if there is additional configuration required etc.
