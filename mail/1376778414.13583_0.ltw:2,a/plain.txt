I do not recommend JACK exposing this API. Atomic interfaces are hard to
maintain and test across a wide range of processor architectures and OS
platforms.

Ten years ago, I sought other alternatives before introducing some internal
functions needed for certain multi-threading situations, but I could not
find anything suitable.

Now there are better alternatives which are fully maintained, such as the
boost atomic implementation, and the new std::atomic feature in C++11.

JACK should not take the responsibility for maintaining things like that.
