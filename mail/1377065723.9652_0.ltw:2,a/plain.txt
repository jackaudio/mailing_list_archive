Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack beginner question

Greetings,

I am just beginning to look at Jack.  I am running Ubuntu 13.04 and I installed the binaries and QJackCtrl seems to work just fine.  That makes me think that so far I have the deamon running as it should.

I want to compile just the simplest of your example clients programs to get started. 
 I download the Jack sources and put them in my user space.  There I find metro.c.  In a terminal window I try to compile and I run into path problems.

Here is what is reported:

val@zar:~/JackFiles/jack-1.9.9.5/example-clients$  gcc -o metronome `pkg-config --cflags --libs jack` metro.c

Package jack was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `jack.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'jack' found
metro.c:30:23: fatal error: jack/jack.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.


I guess my question is what should PKG_CONFIG_PATH point to?

I would appreciate any suggestions.
