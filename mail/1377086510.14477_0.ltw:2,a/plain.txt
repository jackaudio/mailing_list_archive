Like some other people mentioned, you need the -dev packages for 
libjack. But the metro client should be available in the (some) jack 
package. It's called jack_metro. You could also try tools like jack_lsp 
to check if the daemon is running fine..

But just to answer your question: pkg-config looks in some default paths 
for .pc files. One of them should be /usr/lib/pkgconfig. If you want it 
to search additional paths, then you can point it to e.g. 
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig, this is where the .pc files of packages are 
often put when you build the packages yourself from source and leave the 
default prefix /usr/local unchanged. Installing libjack-dev (or whatever 
it's called) should give you /usr/lib/pkgconfig/jack.pc. So no need to 
adjust the PKG_CONFIG_PATH..

Have fun,
