&gt; First, "Thank you" to Pawel and Flo for helping me as I try to compile 
&gt; anything with jack.
&gt;
&gt; I have now installed libjack-dev and one result seems to be that I now 
&gt; have a path and file:
&gt; /usr/include/jack/jack.h
&gt; which I take to be a good thing.
&gt; When I try to compile, now the compiler now finds jack.h but none of 
&gt; its references resolve.  I now need to be linked into some jack 
&gt; library(s) that either I don't yet have or I have them in one or more 
&gt; wrong locations.
&gt; Compiling metro.c yields:
&gt; val@zar:~/JackFiles/jack-1.9.9.5/example-clients$ gcc -o metronome 
&gt; `pkg-config --cflags --libs jack` metro.c
&gt; /tmp/ccnO5ZRZ.o: In function `signal_handler':
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0x16): undefined reference to `jack_client_close'
&gt; /tmp/ccnO5ZRZ.o: In function `process_silence':
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0x81): undefined reference to `jack_port_get_buffer'
&gt; /tmp/ccnO5ZRZ.o: In function `process_audio':
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0xc3): undefined reference to `jack_port_get_buffer'
&gt; /tmp/ccnO5ZRZ.o: In function `process':
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0x214): undefined reference to `jack_transport_query'
&gt; /tmp/ccnO5ZRZ.o: In function `main':
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0x6e2): undefined reference to `jack_client_open'
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0x736): undefined reference to `jack_set_process_callback'
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0x75c): undefined reference to `jack_port_register'
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0x772): undefined reference to `jack_get_sample_rate'
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0xb31): undefined reference to `sin'
&gt; metro.c:(.text+0xbaf): undefined reference to `jack_activate'
&gt; collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
&gt;
&gt; I looked to see if Flo's suggested path to jack.pc existed and found 
&gt; that my jack.pc is one directory farther down at: 
&gt; /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
&gt;
&gt; I tried setting:
&gt;   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig; export 
&gt; PKG_CONFIG_PATH
&gt; and confirmed that this setting worked:
&gt;   printenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH
&gt; /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
&gt;
&gt; But, compiling again did not change the failure to find the needed 
&gt; links to the jack.h entry points (jack_client_close etc.)
&gt;
&gt; I have messed with jack so much now that I may have made it impossible 
&gt; to get a working combination of files and paths and libraries.
&gt;
&gt; But, I so much need further advice!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,

&gt;&gt; Greetings,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am just beginning to look at Jack.  I am running Ubuntu 13.04 and I 
&gt;&gt; installed the binaries and QJackCtrl seems to work just fine.  That 
&gt;&gt; makes me think that so far I have the deamon running as it should.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I want to compile just the simplest of your example clients programs 
&gt;&gt; to get started.
&gt;&gt;    I download the Jack sources and put them in my user space.  There 
&gt;&gt; I find metro.c.  In a terminal window I try to compile and I run into 
&gt;&gt; path problems.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here is what is reported:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; val@zar:~/JackFiles/jack-1.9.9.5/example-clients$ gcc -o metronome 
&gt;&gt; `pkg-config --cflags --libs jack` metro.c
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Package jack was not found in the pkg-config search path.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps you should add the directory containing `jack.pc'
&gt;&gt; to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
&gt;&gt; No package 'jack' found
&gt;&gt; metro.c:30:23: fatal error: jack/jack.h: No such file or directory
&gt;&gt; compilation terminated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I guess my question is what should PKG_CONFIG_PATH point to?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would appreciate any suggestions.
&gt; Like some other people mentioned, you need the -dev packages for
&gt; libjack. But the metro client should be available in the (some) jack
&gt; package. It's called jack_metro. You could also try tools like jack_lsp
&gt; to check if the daemon is running fine..
&gt;
&gt; But just to answer your question: pkg-config looks in some default paths
&gt; for .pc files. One of them should be /usr/lib/pkgconfig. If you want it
&gt; to search additional paths, then you can point it to e.g.
&gt; /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig, this is where the .pc files of packages are
&gt; often put when you build the packages yourself from source and leave the
&gt; default prefix /usr/local unchanged. Installing libjack-dev (or whatever
&gt; it's called) should give you /usr/lib/pkgconfig/jack.pc. So no need to
&gt; adjust the PKG_CONFIG_PATH..
&gt;
&gt; Have fun,
&gt; Flo
