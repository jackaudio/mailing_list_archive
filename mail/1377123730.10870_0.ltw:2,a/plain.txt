Just running the following command should print the line after it:
$ pkg-config --cflags --libs jack
-ljack -lpthread -lrt

If it doesn't print that your PATH is set wrong, and pkg-config can't find
you .pc file.
A hacky workaround is to just use the following to compile:
gcc -o metronome -ljack -lpthread -lrt metro.c

Unrelated advice: please send "plain text" instead of HTML emails to the
mailing list, they're easier to read :)

Hope that helps, -Harry
