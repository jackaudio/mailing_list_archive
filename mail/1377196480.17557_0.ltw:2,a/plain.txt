Right, buffer size as such is irrelevant here.

Just to make sure theres no confusion stemming from my original
question: can i expect Jack to do its next call for my callback-func at
a certain frame offset since the previous call?

Aim here is to use jacks frame-accurate timing to schedule events at
'some_future_frame' by tagging with that frame's
'period_boundary_frame_no + 'frame_offset_inside_buffer - and as periods
fly by lookup the current buffers worth of events using
'period_boundary_frame_no.

It seems to work great in the client im building atm., perhaps im just
being lucky.
