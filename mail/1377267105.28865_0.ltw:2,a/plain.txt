i see, im just being lucky, better not depend on frame-time for some
future event then.  (Havent been able to break it yet though, but taking
your word for it it will.)

But im still trying to get right what the various jack_*_frame_time()
provides or not vs. relative timing.

Various Jack-docs say my callback will be called 'at the right time' by
the server - whats 'the right time' here?  Some time which makes my data
come through at the other end before its needed?  A promise to callback
exactly one period after the previous call?

Ill have a look at the transport things.
