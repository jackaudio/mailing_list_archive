Hi, I had until yesterday a working jack setup between my laptop and
server using netone. While trying to troubleshoot why the audio
was so out of sync while playing videos in mplayer, I tried playing
with my iptables firewall script. (The sync problem seemed to have
started when I connected a new router.)

Well, I don't know exactly how I've done it but now I get no networked
sound at all unless I stop the master firewall completely.

I'm guessing that I took out a line allowing access to a certain port.
Google doesn't help much except that I've found that UDP 3000 and UDP
on 19000 may be involved but allowing those hasn't helped. I also 
tried playing with ICMP echo settings, but also to no avail.

So my question is, what ports should be set on the master firewall to
fix this problem? I tried looking at netstat but only found some
random ports in use, which isn't very helpful.

Incidentally, I also tried using -d net instead of -d netone, but then
I get no sound at all, even with firewalls on both machines off.

Hoping someone can help
