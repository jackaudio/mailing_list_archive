&gt;&gt; &gt;Hi, I had until yesterday a working jack setup between my laptop and
&gt;&gt; &gt;server using netone. While trying to troubleshoot why the audio
&gt;&gt; &gt;was so out of sync while playing videos in mplayer, I tried playing
&gt;&gt; &gt;with my iptables firewall script. (The sync problem seemed to have
&gt;&gt; &gt;started when I connected a new router.)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Well, I don't know exactly how I've done it but now I get no networked
&gt;&gt; &gt;sound at all unless I stop the master firewall completely.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I'm guessing that I took out a line allowing access to a certain port.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Google doesn't help much except that I've found that UDP 3000 and UDP
&gt;&gt; &gt;on 19000 may be involved but allowing those hasn't helped. I also
&gt;&gt; &gt;tried playing with ICMP echo settings, but also to no avail.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;So my question is, what ports should be set on the master firewall to
&gt;UDP/19000. At the same time you need to make sure you're allowing local
&gt;musticats to get out of your firewall to your broadcast segment. Or you
&gt;need to use unicast peering instead of default multicast discovery.

I think that unicast would be OK for my purposes at the moment, so
I'll look into that.

&gt;&gt; &gt;fix this problem? I tried looking at netstat but only found some
&gt;&gt; &gt;random ports in use, which isn't very helpful.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Incidentally, I also tried using -d net instead of -d netone, but then
&gt;&gt; &gt;I get no sound at all, even with firewalls on both machines off.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well I solved the netone problem by specifying a -r port with
&gt;&gt; jack_netsource.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'd still like to know why using -d net doesn't work for me though.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;First you need to understand the difference between netjack and netone.
&gt;
&gt;From jackdmp perspective netjack(2) is Jack2 networking stack, while
&gt;netone is jack(1) networking. Protocols are pretty different, as well as
&gt;daemons themselves.
&gt;
&gt;Then the difference between master and slave.
&gt;
&gt;Master is the one how has access to hardware and listens (passively)
&gt;for slaves to connect while genrating beacons for them to discover itself.
&gt;
&gt;You can think of it as who is the clocking master - master is its own master
&gt;(having clocks from underlying hardware) and slave is using master clocks.
&gt;But slave is actively performing attempts to connect to the master (it is
&gt;active from network perspective - initates connection).
&gt;
&gt;So when you say -d net - you're creating network slave - i.e. jack2 daemon
&gt;who is expecting to connect to the master and be driven by that.
&gt;Network slave  - unless instructed to use unicast master - is waiting for
&gt;master's beacons on the BMA network to initiate connections. Once it
&gt;discovers master's beacon - it connects to it and becomes a part of the loop
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Ruslan

Thanks for the info. I'll see how I get on with this.
