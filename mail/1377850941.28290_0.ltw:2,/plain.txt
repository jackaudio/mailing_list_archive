Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Migrating to JACK2

Hey,
It's been a while since I've been posting questions.
I'm interested on starting over with my project I started a few years back,
and I want to migrate my audio handling from JACK1 to JACK2.
Unfortunately, the main site doesn't provide information regarding API, or
a "getting started" guide (or is it...).
What do you suggest I do?
I have installed jack on my machine (sudo jackd --version => 1.9.9.5), and
as I can see (due to the errors I get...) the API had several changes.

Thnx!
