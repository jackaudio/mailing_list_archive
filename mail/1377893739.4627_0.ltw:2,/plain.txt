In-Reply-To: Ben Eggehorn [Jack-Devel] Using Jack to route ASIO audio over Remote Terminal session (1377892893.3296_0.ltw:2,)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack to route ASIO audio over Remote Terminal session

Hi Ben,

See http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows

Looks like you are missing the final '-d' option and the quotes around
the ASIO driver string

%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files
(x86)\Jack\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2"

See if that helps...

Kind regards,
GrahamG
