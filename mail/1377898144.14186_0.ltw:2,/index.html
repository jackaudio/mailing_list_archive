Hi GrahamG,
 
Thanks for the reply.
 
I double checked my Jack PortAudio target settings and it is actually:
 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2"
 
Not sure why the info I copied and pasted from my custom cmd shortcut with the /k switch was missing those details (?!).
 
At any rate, I think I realized the problem. When I was trying to start Jack PortAudio first and then select Jack Router from my audio setup within the ASIO app. 
 
I just now tried starting my app first, then selected ASIO4ALL and THEN starting Jack PortAudio and the cmd window stays open and I am able to select "connect" within Jack Control.
 
I'm still not out of the woods at this point as I'm still not getting audio over through Remote Desktop. Any tips on this next step?
 
In the Jack Control app, I can see available readable/writable clients and have made connections between capture 1/2 and playback 1/2 but am still not getting audio. Opening the system sounds mixer, I see "Remote Audio", "System Sounds" and "Jack Audio Con..." but no audio signal is present when I trigger sounds on my ASIO virtual instrument. I've also experimented in the Patchbay and added Input and Output sockets/plugs and hit "connect" but still nothing...

&gt; Hi Ben,
&gt; 
&gt; See http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like you are missing the final '-d' option and the quotes around
&gt; the ASIO driver string
&gt; 
&gt; %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files
&gt; (x86)\Jack\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2"
&gt; 
&gt; See if that helps...
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; GrahamG

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm looking into finding a solution that will allow me to route audio from
&gt; &gt; an ASIO audio application (ASIO4ALL) through an internet based Windows
&gt; &gt; Remote Desktop connection.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My audio host is Avid ProTools running ASIO4ALL as the playback engine. I
&gt; &gt; had limited success using Virtual Audio Cable in that it worked fine over
&gt; &gt; LAN but did not pass audio over a Remote Terminal session (known limitation
&gt; &gt; of the software).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've just discovered Jack and am trying to wrap my head around the
&gt; &gt; configuration. Here is my current installation and setup:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Windows 7x64
&gt; &gt; ASIO4ALL 2.10 installed
&gt; &gt; Jack 1.9.9 installed and 64bit .dll has been registered successfully
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After running Jack Port Audio, I get the message in the command window that
&gt; &gt; "Jack Server started in realtime mode with priority 10" however the command
&gt; &gt; window does not stay open as detailed in the Using Jack on Windows FAQ. It
&gt; &gt; appears as though something is failing at this stage? I used the following
&gt; &gt; command  to keep the cmd window open so I could try to find more info about
&gt; &gt; the possible error:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\jackd.exe" -R
&gt; &gt; -S -d portaudio ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (the /k switch simply forces the cmd window to stay open after executing the
&gt; &gt; command)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After running this command, the window displays this information:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At this point I can't figure out how to get past this issue.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Even though the command windows closes I do see JackRouter listed in *one*
&gt; &gt; of my ASIO apps audio setup pages. I have several ASIO based audio apps on
&gt; &gt; my system but so far the only one that shows the Jack Router is GForce MTron
&gt; &gt; Pro (my desired application, ProTools, does not show the Jack Router as an
&gt; &gt; option). Regardless, trying to select Jack Router as the playback device
&gt; &gt; fails with the message:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Couldn't load the ASIO Driver because the device is not connected"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd appreciate any help you can offer me into getting this properly
&gt; &gt; configured. Thanks so much!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;
