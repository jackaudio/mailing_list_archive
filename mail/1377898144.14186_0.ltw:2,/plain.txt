Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack to route ASIO audio over Remote Terminal session

Hi GrahamG,
 
Thanks for the reply.
 
I double checked my Jack PortAudio target settings and it is actually:
 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\jackd.exe" -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2"
 
Not sure why the info I copied and pasted from my custom cmd shortcut with the /k switch was missing those details (?!).
 
At any rate, I think I realized the problem. When I was trying to start Jack PortAudio first and then select Jack Router from my audio setup within the ASIO app. 
 
I just now tried starting my app first, then selected ASIO4ALL and THEN starting Jack PortAudio and the cmd window stays open and I am able to select "connect" within Jack Control.
 
I'm still not out of the woods at this point as I'm still not getting audio over through Remote Desktop. Any tips on this next step?
 
In the Jack Control app, I can see available readable/writable clients and have made connections between capture 1/2 and playback 1/2 but am still not getting audio. Opening the system sounds mixer, I see "Remote Audio", "System Sounds" and "Jack Audio Con..." but no audio signal is present when I trigger sounds on my ASIO virtual instrument. I've also experimented in the Patchbay and added Input and Output sockets/plugs and hit "connect" but still nothing...
 
Ben
