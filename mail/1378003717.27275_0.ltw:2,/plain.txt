Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] FW: Jack beginner question - which files are Jack's library files?

I'm a beginner myself but:

Have you tried separating the compile and link steps?

gcc -c -o metro.o metro.c
gcc -o metronome metro.o -ljack

BTW I believe "-L" should point to the include path (e.g., 
/usr/include/jack) rather than to the libraries (/usr/lib/...).
You can check the pkg-config with 
pkg-config --cflags jack
pkg-config --libs jack

hope this helps
