In-Reply-To: Royi Freifeld [Jack-Devel] Migrating to JACK2 (1377850941.28290_0.ltw:2,)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Migrating to JACK2

there's really no "migration". jack1 and jack2 are binary-compatible,
API-compatible replacements for each other. there are no changes for you to
think about. i'm not sure where you got any other ideas.

there are some very minor changes to the API. very, very minor. when it
doubt, do not use the jack2 versions since in general it is the only
version that has added calls.
