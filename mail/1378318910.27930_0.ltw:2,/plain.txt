Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Trouble with command line arguments to jack in qjackctl under windows

Hi,

I got this error message from a user of Radium on Windows:

"
Hi,

When I start Radium and get this message:

The "-S" parameter is mandatory to make the jack server work correctly.

The jackd argument line can be set in QJackCtl ("Jack Control") under Setup
-> Settings -> Server Prefix. The line should look like this:

jackd -S

Then, if I follow the instructions Jack crash and I get this message:

15:13:59.146 Patchbay deactivated.
15:13:59.151 Statistics reset.
15:14:01.968 JACK is starting...
15:14:01.971 jackd -dportaudio -r48000 -p512 jackd -S
15:14:01.996 JACK was started with PID=35362840.
15:14:02.058 JACK has crashed.
15:14:04.064 Could not connect to JACK server as client. - Overall
operation failed. - Unable to connect to server. Please check the messages
window for more info.

If I ignore the first error message and press OK and go on, Radium works.
"

I said I didn't know what the problem could be and asked if he could
upgrade to
the latest version of jack. But that didn't make a difference.

Anyone idea?
