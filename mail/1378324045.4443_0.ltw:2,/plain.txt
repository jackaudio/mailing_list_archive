Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [jack2] netone backend crashes at startup on x86_64 back to version 1.9.7

I've filed an issue a while back on github about this issue, maybe it 
was the wrong channel, so I'll try here:
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/issues/38

jack2 version 1.9.7 is the last one that has a working netone backend on 
my current system, all later versions up to git HEAD crash at startup. 
It works fine though on my other (i686 machine)
jackd -d netone >> CRASH

uname -a >> Linux melamori 3.10.10-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Aug 30 
11:30:06 CEST 2013 x86_64 GNU/Linux

That's how jack2 is built on ArchLinux:
https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/jack2 


There are others a part from me having this problem on ArchLinux (most 
probably only on x86_64).
So chances are high that it's not only my system which is to blame.

I've tried to build the sources with debug symbols to get a hint from 
gdb where the problem may be, but they were not included;-(
Is there some additional hook needed apart from './waf configure 
--debug'? (I'm not used to waf...)

Funny enough, it starts up fine when started within valgrind.

Any ideas where the problem may be or where I should look further?
