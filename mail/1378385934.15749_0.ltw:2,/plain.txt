Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Suddenly Nuendo doesnt work with JACK

Hello!
For a long time I have successfully used Jack in combination with Nuendo with any problem. However, since yesterday something really strange  happens.
Step 1. I start Jack server and then Nuendo.
step 2. Select JackRouter as the Audio Device.
this is the usual routine that always worked.
The problem I am facing is that when I play a music track in Nuendo, the player cursor moves but no signal is displayed on the Nuendo volume meter.
However, when I select another audio device the signal meter in Nuendo does show audio signal. It looks like Jack did a muting on the audio tracks on Nuendo. 
What can be this problem due to? I didn't change the set up. I'm sure the problem is located in Jack because for other audio devices, Nuendo works properly.
 
Thank u very much.
