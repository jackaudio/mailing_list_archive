Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Bluez with JACK?

Hi,

I have some possible commercial interest for adding support for the bluez
API/Protocol/Stack directly to JACK.

- http://www.bluez.org/

Apart from giving direct access to bluetooth devices for i/o it would also
allow for controlling JACK transport using handsfree or remote bluetooth
devices and I'm sure there are other technological/artistic benefits too.

There are two ways that I can see to go about this process.

1: Leverage and further integrate PulseAudio support
2: Add direct support for bluez to JACK


Does anyone have any technical concerns or feedback/suggestions on this
topic?


Cheers
