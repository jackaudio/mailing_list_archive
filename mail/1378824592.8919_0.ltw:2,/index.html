AFAIR the jack_cycle_wait function is supposed to fail (and so properly quit the thread) if the server is shutdown. On which OS are you testing?

Can you send me tour jack_cycle_wait/jack_cycle_signal based code?

Thanks.

Le 10 sept. 2013 &#xE0; 16:35, Wolfgang Lorenz &lt;[hidden]&gt; a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently trying to create a JACK-based backend for an already
&gt; existing audio processing software. The software creates multiple
&gt; RT-threads and at the end of each cycle hands the control to the audio
&gt; driver, which does the communication to whatever interface is chosen.
&gt; So far, nothing new... Using the callback free API, the communication
&gt; to the jack server went well, until the point where I shut down the
&gt; jack server and the jack client blocked unrecoverably in the
&gt; jack_cycle_wait() call.
&gt; 
&gt; Some studies of the jack2-sources showed, that jack_cycle_wait() is
&gt; waiting 0x7FFFFFFF microseconds (about 2147.4836 seconds) for the
&gt; signal to wake up, and afterwards kills the thread, if the signal
&gt; didn't arrive. I guess that it is expected, that jack_cycle_wait() is
&gt; solely called from the callback function provided by
&gt; jack_set_process_thread(). I'm guilty, because this is, what I am not
&gt; doing. Since I am already operating in a RT thread, I just call
&gt; jack_client_wait() from the thread my method is called on. Using the
&gt; JACK-provided thread would only mean to introduce yet another
&gt; synchronization point -- which by the way would be the same as in the
&gt; callback API.
&gt; 
&gt; Thinking about it, I don't really understand why the thread has to be
&gt; killed, after the time out. Even if jack_cycle_wait() was called from
&gt; the callback function, a return value of 0 should suffice to signal the
&gt; jack client, to please return from the function -- the thread would
&gt; close down automatically afterwards.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the maximum time out duration is somewhat impractical, especially
&gt; in audio processing terms, as it leaves the system hanging with no
&gt; possibility to correctly handling any anomalies. I think the best way
&gt; here would be to leave it to the user, what time is adequate.
&gt; 
&gt; As a conclusion, I can't use this API, though it looked very promising,
&gt; and I will have to implement the callback way with some means of
&gt; synchronization. (Even if this was "fixed" in any way now, I need to
&gt; stay compatible with some older versions.)
&gt; 
&gt; But what I wanted to know is: Is this really the way the callback-free
&gt; API is supposed to work? Does anybody else see this as a problem or bug
&gt; that should be fixed?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;  Wolfgang Lorenz
