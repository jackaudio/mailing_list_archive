(1) for reference, ardour has used the "callback free API" for years
without issues (including server shutdown)
(2) your use of JACK sounds odd. whether you use the callback API or the
callback-free one, audio processing
       needs to be driven by the audio interface, not your code. the way
you have described doesn't make it
      clear to me that this is the case.
