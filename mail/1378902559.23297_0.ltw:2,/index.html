Thanks St&#xE9;phane and Paul for your replies.

&gt; AFAIR the jack_cycle_wait function is supposed to fail (and so properly
&gt; quit the thread) if the server is shutdown. On which OS are you
&gt; testing?

I'm on Linux (mainly Fedora) with the current stable version of JACK,
built from the sources. (JACK 1.9.9.5, that is.)
http://www.jackaudio.org/downloads/jack-1.9.9.5.tar.bz2

&gt; Can you send me tour jack_cycle_wait/jack_cycle_signal based code?

I've attached an example file, with a setup similar to the project, I'm
working on. But not quite: For simplicity I only create one thread, as
the synchronization with other threads is not my problem ;-). Also, in
this example I don't require RT threads. As I am currently operating
only in user space (for testing purposes), I don't have the permissions
anyway: The same applies to the JACK server.

The program simply sets up one thread, in which a loop is run, that
uses jack_cycle_wait() and jack_cycle_signal(), to synchronize the
reading and writing of audio data.

&gt; Thanks.

&gt; &gt; But what I wanted to know is: Is this really the way the callback-free
&gt; &gt; API is supposed to work? Does anybody else see this as a problem or bug
&gt; &gt; that should be fixed?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; (1) for reference, ardour has used the "callback free API" for years
&gt; without issues (including server shutdown)

I had a look at the sources: Ardour is using the JACK-provided thread.
That's what I wanted to avoid, as I could simply have used the callback
API. I've tried to start it to see how it behaves, but the current
git-version crashes instantly SIGSEGVs at startup. I currently don't
have the time to investigate much further, but thank you for the hint.

&gt; (2) your use of JACK sounds odd. whether you use the callback API or the
&gt; callback-free one, audio processing
&gt;        needs to be driven by the audio interface, not your code. the way
&gt; you have described doesn't make it
&gt;       clear to me that this is the case.

Please, have a look at the attached file, for an example, of how I
wanted to use it.


Greetings,
  Wolfgang
