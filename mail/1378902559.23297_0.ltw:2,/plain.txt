I'm on Linux (mainly Fedora) with the current stable version of JACK,
built from the sources. (JACK 1.9.9.5, that is.)
http://www.jackaudio.org/downloads/jack-1.9.9.5.tar.bz2

I've attached an example file, with a setup similar to the project, I'm
working on. But not quite: For simplicity I only create one thread, as
the synchronization with other threads is not my problem ;-). Also, in
this example I don't require RT threads. As I am currently operating
only in user space (for testing purposes), I don't have the permissions
anyway: The same applies to the JACK server.

The program simply sets up one thread, in which a loop is run, that
uses jack_cycle_wait() and jack_cycle_signal(), to synchronize the
reading and writing of audio data.

I had a look at the sources: Ardour is using the JACK-provided thread.
That's what I wanted to avoid, as I could simply have used the callback
API. I've tried to start it to see how it behaves, but the current
git-version crashes instantly SIGSEGVs at startup. I currently don't
have the time to investigate much further, but thank you for the hint.

Please, have a look at the attached file, for an example, of how I
wanted to use it.
