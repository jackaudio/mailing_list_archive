JACK provides a thread primarily in the interest of a uniform
cross-platform model. if you try this on OS X or windows, you will find
that the APIs there also provide a thread in which your callback will run.

what you're doing is adding another layer of buffering between your own RT
thread(s) and JACK - this is contrary to the entire purpose and intent of a
pull-mode audio API. it adds to your latency and increases the complexity
of your code design.

realtime audio is always implemented, ultimately, around a pull model (the
hardware defines when transfer takes place). if you want to ignore that and
somehow imagine that you can do your own scheduling, then you just need to
add a ringbuffer between your other threads and the one that runs the
callback. the only cases i know where this is important is when running
FFT's or other similar algorithms which have significant internal latency
due to their window-based model of accumulating a certain amount of data
before being able to process. you can always wrap a pull model as a push
model simply by adding buffering, but the normal case for doing this is
where the audio generation code is running in a non-RT context and needs to
be "isolated" from the demands of RT processing. it doesn't appear that
your program fits into this category.

&gt; &gt; AFAIR the jack_cycle_wait function is supposed to fail (and so properly
&gt; &gt; quit the thread) if the server is shutdown. On which OS are you
&gt; &gt; testing?
&gt;
&gt; I'm on Linux (mainly Fedora) with the current stable version of JACK,
&gt; built from the sources. (JACK 1.9.9.5, that is.)
&gt; http://www.jackaudio.org/downloads/jack-1.9.9.5.tar.bz2
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you send me tour jack_cycle_wait/jack_cycle_signal based code?
&gt;
&gt; I've attached an example file, with a setup similar to the project, I'm
&gt; working on. But not quite: For simplicity I only create one thread, as
&gt; the synchronization with other threads is not my problem ;-). Also, in
&gt; this example I don't require RT threads. As I am currently operating
&gt; only in user space (for testing purposes), I don't have the permissions
&gt; anyway: The same applies to the JACK server.
&gt;
&gt; The program simply sets up one thread, in which a loop is run, that
&gt; uses jack_cycle_wait() and jack_cycle_signal(), to synchronize the
&gt; reading and writing of audio data.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But what I wanted to know is: Is this really the way the callback-free
&gt; &gt; &gt; API is supposed to work? Does anybody else see this as a problem or bug
&gt; &gt; &gt; that should be fixed?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (1) for reference, ardour has used the "callback free API" for years
&gt; &gt; without issues (including server shutdown)
&gt;
&gt; I had a look at the sources: Ardour is using the JACK-provided thread.
&gt; That's what I wanted to avoid, as I could simply have used the callback
&gt; API. I've tried to start it to see how it behaves, but the current
&gt; git-version crashes instantly SIGSEGVs at startup. I currently don't
&gt; have the time to investigate much further, but thank you for the hint.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; (2) your use of JACK sounds odd. whether you use the callback API or the
&gt; &gt; callback-free one, audio processing
&gt; &gt;        needs to be driven by the audio interface, not your code. the way
&gt; &gt; you have described doesn't make it
&gt; &gt;       clear to me that this is the case.
&gt;
&gt; Please, have a look at the attached file, for an example, of how I
&gt; wanted to use it.
&gt;
