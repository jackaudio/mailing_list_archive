Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using the callback free API with self-created RT-threads

JACK provides a thread primarily in the interest of a uniform
cross-platform model. if you try this on OS X or windows, you will find
that the APIs there also provide a thread in which your callback will run.

what you're doing is adding another layer of buffering between your own RT
thread(s) and JACK - this is contrary to the entire purpose and intent of a
pull-mode audio API. it adds to your latency and increases the complexity
of your code design.

realtime audio is always implemented, ultimately, around a pull model (the
hardware defines when transfer takes place). if you want to ignore that and
somehow imagine that you can do your own scheduling, then you just need to
add a ringbuffer between your other threads and the one that runs the
callback. the only cases i know where this is important is when running
FFT's or other similar algorithms which have significant internal latency
due to their window-based model of accumulating a certain amount of data
before being able to process. you can always wrap a pull model as a push
model simply by adding buffering, but the normal case for doing this is
where the audio generation code is running in a non-RT context and needs to
be "isolated" from the demands of RT processing. it doesn't appear that
your program fits into this category.
