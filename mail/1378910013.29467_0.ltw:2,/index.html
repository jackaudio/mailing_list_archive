The better way would be to use the JACK RT thread and implement the real code in the function given with jack_set_process_thread. (so in your case in  JackDriver::threads). This function would use the  jack_cycle_wait/jack_cycle_signal API. Then you can create additional workers threads, and add the proper synchronization mechanism between the JACK RT "master" thread at the worker threads.

&gt; Thanks St&#xE9;phane and Paul for your replies.

&gt;&gt; AFAIR the jack_cycle_wait function is supposed to fail (and so properly
&gt;&gt; quit the thread) if the server is shutdown. On which OS are you
&gt;&gt; testing?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm on Linux (mainly Fedora) with the current stable version of JACK,
&gt; built from the sources. (JACK 1.9.9.5, that is.)
&gt; http://www.jackaudio.org/downloads/jack-1.9.9.5.tar.bz2
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can you send me tour jack_cycle_wait/jack_cycle_signal based code?
&gt; 
&gt; I've attached an example file, with a setup similar to the project, I'm
&gt; working on. But not quite: For simplicity I only create one thread, as
&gt; the synchronization with other threads is not my problem ;-). Also, in
&gt; this example I don't require RT threads. As I am currently operating
&gt; only in user space (for testing purposes), I don't have the permissions
&gt; anyway: The same applies to the JACK server.
&gt; 
&gt; The program simply sets up one thread, in which a loop is run, that
&gt; uses jack_cycle_wait() and jack_cycle_signal(), to synchronize the
&gt; reading and writing of audio data.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But what I wanted to know is: Is this really the way the callback-free
&gt;&gt;&gt; API is supposed to work? Does anybody else see this as a problem or bug
&gt;&gt;&gt; that should be fixed?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; (1) for reference, ardour has used the "callback free API" for years
&gt;&gt; without issues (including server shutdown)
&gt; 
&gt; I had a look at the sources: Ardour is using the JACK-provided thread.
&gt; That's what I wanted to avoid, as I could simply have used the callback
&gt; API. I've tried to start it to see how it behaves, but the current
&gt; git-version crashes instantly SIGSEGVs at startup. I currently don't
&gt; have the time to investigate much further, but thank you for the hint.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; (2) your use of JACK sounds odd. whether you use the callback API or the
&gt;&gt; callback-free one, audio processing
&gt;&gt;       needs to be driven by the audio interface, not your code. the way
&gt;&gt; you have described doesn't make it
&gt;&gt;      clear to me that this is the case.
&gt; 
&gt; Please, have a look at the attached file, for an example, of how I
&gt; wanted to use it.
