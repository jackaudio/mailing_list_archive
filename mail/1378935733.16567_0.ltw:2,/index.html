&gt; &gt; The better way would be to use the JACK RT thread and implement the real
&gt; &gt; code in the function given with jack_set_process_thread. (so in your case
&gt; &gt; in  JackDriver::threads). This function would use the
&gt; &gt;  jack_cycle_wait/jack_cycle_signal API. Then you can create additional
&gt; &gt; workers threads, and add the proper synchronization mechanism between the
&gt; &gt; JACK RT "master" thread at the worker threads.
&gt; 
&gt; precisely.

I've run some tests, with your suggested (and the supposed, as I
understand it) way of implementation and indeed, the jack_cycle_wait()
call no longer blocks. I guess, that internally the timed wait returns
after some signal is thrown at the "correct" process thread, when the
server shuts down. Subsequently this thread is killed (and the created
threads are left dangling around).

Unfortunately, that is still not what I hoped for. After all, the thread
creation and scheduling is already existing, working and tested in the
project. All I'm doing is provide the driver (the equivalent to the
JackDriver class in my example file) for the JACK connection.

I've had a look at the existing ALSA driver. This one writes the output
and then waits for a block of input samples, effectively achieving a
two buffer latency in the system -- the same as if I would be using the
proposed approaches from the JACK API. This should also be possible to
achieve by writing the output buffers before calling jack_cycle_wait()
and reading the input buffers afterwards. After all, this would kind of
wrap the whole callback around the rest of the program. I should test
this...

Anyway, I just will have to synchronize the reading and writing stuff,
and live with one buffer additional latency (if the above idea fails).
It's not too bad, as the JACK driver was intended for
easy-to-use-testing-desktop-setups (I'm making up words here... ;-) I
hope you nevertheless know what I mean.) Production systems still will
use the ALSA driver.


Thanks again,
  Wolfgang


PS: Still, wouldn't it be good to be able to use some kind of
    jack_cycle_timedwait(client, timeout) from foreign threads?
