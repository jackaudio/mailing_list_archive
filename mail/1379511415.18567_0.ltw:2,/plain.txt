Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Testing JACK and PA latency

there isn't any way to separately compute the "outbound" and "inbound"
latency. in fact, jack_iodelay's message about the value to use for -I and
-O is based on the not-entirely-defensible but somewhat reasonable
assumption that the outbound and inbound latencies are symmetric.

put differently, i don't think there is any way to do what you want.
someone may prove me wrong.
