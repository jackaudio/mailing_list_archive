Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Testing JACK and PA latency

you're trying to measure the time between A and B where you have access to
A (or specifically, a way to carry out measurements there) but no access to
B.

i don't see how this can work. it is a bit like asking "how long does it
take to get from paris to brussels" but when you are unable to cross the
border between france and belgium, and cannot talk to anyone in brussels.
