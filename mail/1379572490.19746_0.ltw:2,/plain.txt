Yes, exactly. It's a conundrum :-)

Can anyone suggest an app that will provide a round trip back into jack
via pulse sink/source?

Perhaps I need to write something specifically for that task that will
communicate with jack and pulse at the same time? Or at least be able to
retrieve useful information...
