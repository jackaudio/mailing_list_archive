Indeed very few cards support that low buffer size: apparently one of the
Creative SoundBlaster series starts on -p8 but xruns internally...
I've heard that some RME gear is capable of running at such low latencies
too. No experience with those RME interfaces (the PCI-E stuff IIRC).

Yes it does: and in doing so creates conciderable DSP overhead. That said,
I've ran jack at -r96000 -p16 -n2. That's an output latency of 0.3ms...
pretty good!

I'll leave this to more experienced hands: I'm not sure.

Nope, but I would be interersted in results / experiences if you do decided
to go that route.

My background is my final-year-college project, investigating real-time
threading / messaging for audio-applications.
Code available: https://github.com/harryhaaren/fypRealtimeCppPrograming

A system had to be tuned to handle these latencies without Xruns: perhaps
interesting to see what I had to do to get a 6 year old laptop running
0.3ms reliably :)

Interesting project idea, I'll keep an eye on it! -Harry
