i should have said "burst transfer" which is pretty much all you want to
use for low audio i think.

interrupts are a totally separate issue. *something* has to wake user space
periodically to initiate audio data generation/processing, and i'm not
aware of how you would do that without an interrupt from something (whether
it is an hrtimer or the audio interface is not really relevant).

&gt;  you start to see the inefficiency as you approach back-to-back transfers
&gt; -&gt; 1 usec (at least on current CPUs &#133; some 6+ yr old laptop its probably in

&gt; The current state of the art for low-latency **anything** is to avoid
&gt; interrupts (as an interrupt itself is ~1-2 usec of processing latency) &#150;
&gt; either in-kernel (e.g. 3.11&#146;s low-latency sockets) or in user space.****

&gt;
&gt; note that the lower limit for PCI burst transfer is 64 bytes, which means
&gt; that if you are only schlepping around two channels worth of 16 bits each,
&gt; you need 16 samples minimum to be able to launch a DMA transfer.
&gt;
&gt; obviously higher channel counts reduce or eliminate this problem.****

&gt; Hello,****
&gt;
&gt; ** **
&gt;
&gt; On my netbook, I was able to start jackd with****
&gt;
&gt; jackd -P62 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p16 -n2****
&gt;
&gt; but the hardware driver didn't support -p8 or -p4.****
&gt;
&gt; ** **
&gt;
&gt; -p16 already requires a lot of fast interrupts, so I assume that to use
&gt; this reliably, I would have to be very careful about setting all of the
&gt; kernel switches, etc.****
&gt;
&gt; ** **
&gt;
&gt; Is there any hope for getting -p8 or -p4 working, even if I have to write
&gt; my own custom device driver? Or has anyone done any work in connecting
&gt; xenomai to jack? Would I be better off writing a xenomai application and
&gt; then find a way to connect it to an ALSA driver directly?****
&gt;
&gt; ** **
&gt;
