Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Very low latency audio

i should have said "burst transfer" which is pretty much all you want to
use for low audio i think.

interrupts are a totally separate issue. *something* has to wake user space
periodically to initiate audio data generation/processing, and i'm not
aware of how you would do that without an interrupt from something (whether
it is an hrtimer or the audio interface is not really relevant).
