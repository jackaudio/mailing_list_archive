Weak linkage will be removed in an upcoming version of the JACK API.

I have also announced on IRC in a discussion wtih Filipe and others that I
plan to implement a version of the meta-data API that has been discussed on
#jack several times in the last year or two. I plan to do so next week.

If successful, this will provide the functionality of Filipe's proposal and
more, including the long sought port meta-data stuff.
