There is this rumour of a 3d extension for JACK that would allow 3d
applications such as Blender, Make Human, etc.. to share realtime 3d
modelling data with other 3d engines such as source, tesseract, ogre,
unigine, etc...

IIUC, it is similar to the jack-video extension that salsaman provided but
for 3d modelling data instead.

Given that JACK is the defacto standard for open source multimedia (audio,
midi, session, network), data sharing it makes sense to me that video and
3d data can be part of the API too.

If you are going to go to the effort of adding support for arbitrary data
formats it might be useful to know of this other project too.
