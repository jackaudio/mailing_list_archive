Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK custom-data API

Meta-data is not data.

Adding new port types is a totally separate task, and the jack-video stuff
was rejected because it didn't add new ports types in the way that we
intended when the API was designed.

This is about adding meta-data to existing objects (clients, ports) within
JACK, not new types of port-transferrable data.
