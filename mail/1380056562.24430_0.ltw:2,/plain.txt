Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Help! Using pipe() before jack_client_open() makes Jack crazy

Hello all,

I'am now debugging some application, some times ago working perfectly 
with Jack. Now I have found, that if an application calls pipe() before 
jack_client_open(), some strange bugs appear. First, the message "jackd: 
wait for startup process exit failed" is printed to a console from which 
an application was run. Looking at Jack sources, I've found out, that 
this is a code of starting jackd. But it has already started from 
another console. In general, the behaviour of an application becomes 
unpredictable at this point, including hang-ups and writes of some trash 
to opened pipes, not initiated by an application itself. So I have no 
idea (and nothing is found in the internet) what is the reason of this 
thing and what should I do to avoid it?

Thanks in advance,
Yury.
