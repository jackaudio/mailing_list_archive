Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Does the Callback Thread ID change ?

Hello everyone,

the subject is almost the complete question.

In detail:

Supposing the server is properly started and all clients are connected - can one be sure the thread on the server side which calls the process function registered by jack_set_process_callback() is always the same ?

and just in case it is not, for what reason would it be stopped and restarted unless there is no configuration change on the server side - which isn't possible in running state anyway, right ?

Best Regards,

Mario Sieck
