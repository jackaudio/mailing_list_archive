Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK custom-data API

The "uuid" branch of JACK1 now contains a functioning but not necessarily
finished API and implementation for arbitrary meta-data for JACK clients
and ports. The implementation uses the Berkeley DB routines to painlessly
deal with interprocess issues including data sharing, locking and so forth.
It has been designed to be very fast for looking up or deleting specific
metadata, less efficient for looking or deleting multiple metadata (e.g.
all metadata associated with a given client).

There is a new tool in the (theoretically shared) tools/ folder called
jack_property which can be used to set/list/delete metadata. It not
finished and there is no man page for it yet.

Work continues. I promised that this would be fully functional by the end
of this week.
