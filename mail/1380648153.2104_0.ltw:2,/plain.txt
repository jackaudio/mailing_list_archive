How many and how large metadata values can the system be expected to
handle? It could be very useful for sequencers to have metadata
associated with MIDI ports that describe the various MIDI programs that
are available on that port and the controllers that are relevant for
them, as well as which programs are currently active on which channels,
but that could easily be hundreds or thousands of values for every port.
