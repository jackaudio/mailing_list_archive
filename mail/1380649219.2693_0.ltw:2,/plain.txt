two followups:

  1) they do have to be representable as null-terminated strings. The API
documentation
      provides the example of "image/png;base64", which uses a convention
from CSS
      on how to "encode" an image as a string

  2) although there is no semantics imposed on metadata keys and values, it
is much
      less useful to use it to associate highly structured data with a port
(or client), since
      this then implies the need for some (presumably library-based) code
to parse
      the structure and be able to use it. the real goal of the metadata
API is to be able
      to tag ports (and clients) with small amounts of data that is outside
of the core
      JACK API but nevertheless useful (such as my WKM examples)
