Thanks very much for this!
I was waiting for jack to have some sort of custom/meta-data API for a 
long time, glad to see it's finally taking shape.

I recommend the following new meta keys:
1. original-client-name (set by jack itself and never changed by the user)
2. port-is-cv (for audio ports that are actually control voltage)

The build system doesn't detect DB and fails, it just continues.
Please add a pkg-config check for libdb.

Finally, because my setup requires jackdbus, I have updated the jack1 
dbus patch (from nedko) for this new updated 0.124 version.
See attachements.

Thanks again!
I'll be using this JACK version in the next days and report any issues I 
find.
