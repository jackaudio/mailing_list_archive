Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK and HDMI out

Hi all,

I'm starting JACK using alsa devices in one of my systems and I'm having
trouble adding in my hdmi's sound channels to it. It's an Nvidia GeForce
210. Basically, whenever I add it to JACK using alsa_out, it only registers
two channels (stereo) instead of the 6 (5.1 surround) or 8 (7.1 surround)
that I know it's capable of. I've read in a few places that it might be an
issue with the way the card stores it's channels and nmap not finding them
but I'm not really sure what to do with that information. Anyone have any
wisdom on how to get all the channels added to JACK audio?
