Thanks for the heads up! Nice work.

Paul, does this mean Jack1 and Jack2 are becoming
 more alike? Or are there still advantages of one over the other?

That is, might (or should) the distros begin to swing
 back in favour of Jack1?

Most seem to be Jack2 - centric at the moment.



people who want:
  

    * multiple cores for parallel data flow

    * interfacing with PulseAudio

    * interfacing with D-Bus

    * click-free connections (and don't mind the larger latency that this 
causes)

will prefer jack2 for some time to come. but perhaps not forever.



Ah yes. Of course, got it thanks.

Also a great big thanks for the configuration instructions 
 on the Jack site concerning making Jack work with PA.

Happy to report everything just works here - I can watch YT,
 run my DAW, play along or record, play a CD, all at the same time.
The distro didn't come like that.

Interesting how, with those configuration instructions, Jack now runs  
 all the time automatically. In fact seems like it can't be stopped easily.

One improvement would be a handy PA/Jack control panel or better
 control with QJackCtl to allow easy changing of, for example,
 sample rate or period size. Because any changes I attempt in QJackCtl 
 are ignored, instead it seems I have to change those PA configuration lines
 or the .jackdrc file directly and restart.

PA is still a bit of a magical mystery to me :)

Tim.
