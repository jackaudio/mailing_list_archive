Again, again, again, and again : click-free connections connections are *nothing* to do with larger latency.

jack2 has one more buffer latency in the so called "asynchronous mode", when the server does the wait for graph end in a given cycle, and write the output buffers from the previous cycle, and is absolutely similar to jack1 regarding latency in the so called "synchronous mode", where the server waits for graph end in a given cycle and write the output buffers produced by the graph in the given cycle

This was explained like 8 years ago in this paper:  http://www.grame.fr/ressources/publications/Jackdmp-lac2005.pdf

History is *not* going to be rewritten. ((-;
