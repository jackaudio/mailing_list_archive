Actually I don't understand the overall situation. For a while JACK2 was 
advertised by main JACK developers as (upcoming) successor of JACK1. But now 
it seems like as major development efforts are once again solely put on JACK1. 
Were there some personal disputes that caused this? Because from technical 
point of view I cannot find good reasons to continue maintaining JACK1.

Besides some of the already mentioned major advantages of JACK2 (IIRC I would 
also add "lower idle CPU load" to that list), there were bugs in JACK1 (i.e. 
dead locks) which by language &amp; design could not even happen in JACK2. Plus, 
adding new features to JACK2 can be achieved in far less time (and higher 
quality) than adding them to JACK1.

Sorry, not intended to step on anybody's toes here. I just have the impression 
that non rational, emotional reasons are involved in current overall situation 
rather than constructive ones. But who knows, maybe I missed something.

&gt; 
&gt; Again, again, again, and again : click-free connections connections are
&gt; *nothing* to do with larger latency.
&gt; 
&gt; jack2 has one more buffer latency in the so called "asynchronous mode",
&gt; when the server does the wait for graph end in a given cycle, and write
&gt; the output buffers from the previous cycle, and is absolutely similar to
&gt; jack1 regarding latency in the so called "synchronous mode", where the
&gt; server waits for graph end in a given cycle and write the output buffers
&gt; produced by the graph in the given cycle
&gt; 
&gt; This was explained like 8 years ago in this paper: 
&gt; http://www.grame.fr/ressources/publications/Jackdmp-lac2005.pdf
