&gt; Actually I don't understand the overall situation. For a while JACK2 was
&gt; advertised by main JACK developers as (upcoming) successor of JACK1.


We discussed this about 18 months to 2 years ago. For better or for worse,
the people who have more recently worked on Jack1's codebase (mostly myself
and Torben Hohn, who is now largely out of Linux audio development) are not
really interested in working on the Jack2 codebase, and obviously Jack2 was
started because of similar feelings regarding Jack1. Torben did in fact
work on a new version of Jack1 that has the same click-free capabilities as
Jack2 (Tschak) but this never landed due to some hard-to-track down bugs.

To try to minimize the amount of duplicated work, a git repository (or
rather, several git repositories) were setup on github so that things that
could be shared between the two implementations would be shared. This
includes headers, example clients, and utility clients. Jack1 has used
these submodules since it landed on github, but nobody has stepped up to
enable Jack2 to share them (Filipe/falktx recently did a couple of small
push requests to move this along, but that is all). So this effort seems
largely wasted at this point in time, which is frustrating.

But now
&gt; it seems like as major development efforts are once again solely put on
&gt; JACK1.
&gt; Were there some personal disputes that caused this? Because from technical
&gt; point of view I cannot find good reasons to continue maintaining JACK1.
&gt;

It is more stable at lower latencies. Jack2 in sync mode has often had
quirks that Jack1 (which only has sync mode) doesn't seem to suffer from.
From my perspective, the major feature that Jack2 has is that it has
Windows support and better OS X support than Jack1, and a developer
(Stephane) who has some reason(s) to be willing to support these to some
extent at least. It is hard to imagine who is going to bring Windows
support to Jack1, or the many improvements and fixes in CoreAudio support
that Stephane has added to Jack2.


&gt; Besides some of the already mentioned major advantages of JACK2 (IIRC I
&gt; would
&gt; also add "lower idle CPU load" to that list), there were bugs in JACK1
&gt; (i.e.
&gt; dead locks) which by language &amp; design could not even happen in JACK2.


Are there bug reports for these dead locks? I am on #jack on IRC 24/7 and I
have not seen reports of deadlocks or lower CPU idle load for years, if
ever. Deadlocks were a problem with Tschak, which is why it did not land.
Jack2 continues to have problems with freewheeling from time to time.
Neither code base is free of bugs, that is clear. Linux distributions have
preferred Jack2 partly because the name suggests that it is the "new"
version of JACK (which is a misunderstanding) and because of its use of
D-Bus to integrate with PulseAudio.


&gt; Plus,
&gt; adding new features to JACK2 can be achieved in far less time (and higher
&gt; quality) than adding them to JACK1.
&gt;

This is a matter of opinion. Torben and myself found the Jack2 code to be
complex and coded in a rather different idiom of C++ than we are used to -
there is nothing wrong with this, but it has a real world effect of meaning
that we didn't want to work on it. I just added a whole new API to Jack1 in
a couple of days. I didn't run into any real problems (though I can
certainly understand that other developers may have the same kind of
response to the Jack1 codebase that I do to Jack2's).

That said, I am not particularly interested in maintaining Jack1 either,
but would like to move forward with a new implementation that attempts to
combine the best of both worlds. I have no idea if I (or anyone else) will
find the time to do this. The idea would be to code something in C++,
utilize something like boost for cross-platform portability, and re-use
lots of code from both jack1 and jack2 while also applying some of the
design lessons that we've learned along the way which are too fundamental
to be usefully applied to either Jack1 or Jack2 (though they could be if
someone was going to put in the time).

My recent work on Jack1 was triggered by the "threat" that an overly
specific new API would get added to JACK2 in spite of years of calling for
a more generic approach (metadata). There have been discussions for several
years about a metadata API for JACK, and significant discussion on IRC from
time to time. An API for this has now been implemented (which also covers
the very same overly specific API that you added for Jack on iOS). My
implementation took account of the fact that it would be sensible to make
it relatively easy to re-use within Jack2 (though it does require the
fundamental addition of UUIDs for clients and ports). I have no idea
whether anyone will ever step up to do that.

Of course, the situation with netjack is even worse, so lets not go there.

In summary, back when I was willing to endorse Jack2 as the successor to
Jack1 rather than an alternate implementation (which is how it started
life), I wasn't aware of the extent to which the different coding idioms it
uses would block the only thing that really matters from a development
perspective: developer involvement. Jack2 has its own development "group"
who are happy with its code structure and who have done some great stuff
(Devin's work on MIDI drivers is really fantastic). But there's no getting
around the fact that for some of us, it just doesn't feel like the right
path to do what we'd like to see happen with JACK. That isn't necessarily a
logically defensible position, but it is reality. Jack1 has already
vanished as the default JACK used by most people, so if you're upset about
continued work on Jack1, rest assured that it will likely take place in
obscurity given Linux distribution's decisions to adopt Jack2 as "jack".
