First off, I appreciate the compliment.  A lot. :)  Thanks.

I wouldn't say that I am "happy with [JACK 2's] code structure".  I
strongly dislike the architecture and design patterns used in JACK 2.
I find the coding style confusing and frustrating (CamelCase function
names are gross).  The overuse of inheritance and underuse of
component architecture makes it very difficult to track down function
definitions.  There are virtual functions that are pointlessly defined
(never used).  I could go on, but I think you get the point.

The reason I chose to add code to JACK 2 is because C++ afforded me
the path of least resistance.

I prefer the architecture and code structure of JACK 1.
