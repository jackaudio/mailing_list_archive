True. But we are not fighting. We just don't all work on the same code :)

Truth is, I am pretty pissed off that Jack2 isn't using the
headers/tools/example-clients repositories, but I realize as well as anyone
else that if you want something done in the open source world, you
generally need to step up and make it happen rather than wishing it will
happen. It is just a shame that this relatively small step toward active
cooperation hasn't been completed.
