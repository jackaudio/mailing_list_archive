You will never like it, even not after 2030. The C++ language is only 
extended, but existing parts of the language are not revised, due to backward 
compatibility reasons. The C++ committee is very strict on that policy. What 
you are asking for is a new language.

I don't mind about how many "leaders" there are, nor do I care about preferred 
code style, naming conventions, internal topology decisions or the programming 
language being used. Those things are too much connected with personal tastes, 
which almost never match. Only people with a *lot* of time or money can enjoy 
that luxury. ;-)

I am just directly comparing use case benefits and future potential of 
implementation JACK1 vs. implementation JACK2 and see no single (rational) 
advantage in JACK1 in that direct comparison.

And with distros it's a nightmare. Some distros use JACK1, some JACK2, some 
ship both, but then they are not optimally packaged, which regularly causes a 
newly compiled app to crash, because it compiled and linked against JACKx, 
while accessing server JACKy at runtime, which sometimes is hard to resolve. 
And if you want to switch from one JACK to the other, you might need to 
recompile half of your system.

Short: this open source diversity is in this particular case of JACK simply 
annoying and unnecessary.

The notion of - let's say emotional involvement - easily comes when you just 
lurk on IRC and wait for a user question about JACKx, and the first reply will 
actually be a question: "Why are you using JACKx, not JACKy?".

I am stunned about how strong the positions are about those two, considering 
that JACK is "just" a sound server, not a desktop environment. I would rather 
like to see that energy being used for JACK to finally supersede PulseAudio as 
default server on major systems.
