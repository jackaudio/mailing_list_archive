Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] major change in jack1 MIDI handling

It is very easy to gripe about the situation.

It is much harder to change it. We've had these discussions before. Nobody
has come up with anything. The closest we have come is the (accepted)
proposal to share headers/tools/example-clients, and even that appears to
be beyond the JACK development community's ability to accomplish (for now).

Although all of that pales in comparison to what would be involved in JACK
"superseding" PulseAudio as a default desktop audio server, a task it was
never designed for and is in many ways entirely unsuited for.
