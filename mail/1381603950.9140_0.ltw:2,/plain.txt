I've never known this to be the case.  Yes some distros break Jack and
have been doing it for years.  Other related problems are/have been
pulse audio interaction and realtime patched kernels.

But afaik jack1 and jack2 are api and abi compatible, and I've switched
between the two on numerous occasions with no bigger problem than
having to restart programs.  Never have I had to recompile software for
use with one or the other.
