This is completely FALSE.

Jack1 and Jack2 remain API and ABI compatible unless an app has used
features of one that are not present in the other (which is rare).

I have routinely switched between Jack1 and Jack2 without recompiling any
of my JACK clients. I have interacted with many individuals on IRC who have
done the same, sometimes many times in one day.

If it doesn't work on distro X, then that is because distro X has
mispackaged things, and not in a JACK-specific way, but in way that relates
to a generic mistake with linking.
