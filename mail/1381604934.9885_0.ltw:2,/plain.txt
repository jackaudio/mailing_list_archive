No, this is also wrong.

They can never co-exist as installed packages (and thankfully no distro
tries that).

But they can be freely interchanged without recompilation, relinkage or
anything at all, in fact.

The mistake  that debian made was to create linkage to an explicit version
of libjack.so rather than the high level (version-less) soname. They have
subsequently fixed that mistake.
