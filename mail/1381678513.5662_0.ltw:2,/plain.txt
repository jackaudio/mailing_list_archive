In Fedora we package only jack2. The only thing we play around with is 
the optflags (packing issue in latest g++ compiler). However, if there 
is active development in jack1 then I feel I have a responsiblity to 
give users that option also (via an opt-in repo or whatever). Its a 
pain, but I think RPM can handle it. As long as can get assurance that 
the headers provided by either will work with dependandant packages I'm 
OK with it.

Also take note that distros do listen to upstream and if we have 
packaged something poorly, please let us know.
