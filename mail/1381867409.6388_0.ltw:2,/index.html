Patrick, with the greatest respect, I think that you are totally barking up
the wrong tree here. And I mean, really the wrong tree. Everything you are
talking about doing seems to add up to a set of band-aids that all fail to
address the core problems with audio on Android. Audio on Android is just
fine unless you care about latency. None of these proposed integrations
with PA are going to make it a platform that can begin to compare with iOS
for music/pro-audio apps.

Ironically, I was talking to a guy at Google who was trying to hire me
yesterday and I (mostly joking) said "the only thing I'd want to do at
Google is fix audio on Android". He then tried to convince me that he could
make that happen.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Recently there have been discussions about the viability of getting
&gt; official JACK support into the mobile audio stack. Currently JACK is left
&gt; out of the mix and Pulse Audio is the default audio system layer.
&gt;
&gt; For most consumer mobile use cases this is not a problem but when it comes
&gt; to professional audio and some specific cases with very hard time limits
&gt; for the audio graph JACK can actually be preferable over the PA API and
&gt; logic.
&gt;
&gt; A few things have been identified that make it hard to just drop JACK into
&gt; the mobile audio stack at this point.
&gt;
&gt; 1: Bluetooth support especially for hands free audio
&gt; 2: "Murphy" system daemon support
&gt; 3: Dealing gracefully with apps that use the PA api
&gt;
&gt; On the PA mailing list we have identified several optimisations that can
&gt; be done to PA that would allow PA and JACK to coexist peacefully and cause
&gt; minimal system disruption from the developer/user perspective.
&gt;
&gt; However, they are mostly required to allow JACK to run and that is not a
&gt; core priority for the PA developers. On the other hand it seems that JACK
&gt; developers are not going to be interested in spending time on optimising
&gt; PA.
&gt;
&gt; So this leads to a slight issue. Is it likely that JACK will be able to
&gt; support both the Bluez and Murphy API's in order to be a drop in
&gt; replacement for PA while it is running on a mobile OS? Or is it better to
&gt; put the time into optimising PA so that we don't have to double up on
&gt; development efforts considering that the PA developers already provide
&gt; Bluez and Murphy support and are funded to work on that part of the audio
&gt; layer?
&gt;
&gt; The optimisations that would enable PA to work better with JACK are not
&gt; trivial and will require some pretty heavy thought and a fair sized chunk
&gt; of time commitment to make them happen.
&gt;
&gt; Its possible that we could get some assistance from the Linux Foundation
&gt; for the development process if we have a good plan and they agree that it
&gt; is an important project. In addition several of the PA developers work at
&gt; Intel and Ubuntu so there might be some support from those areas to
&gt; provide a fully professional and highly optimised audio stack for Linux
&gt; based mobile OS's.
