Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK on mobile

Patrick, with the greatest respect, I think that you are totally barking up
the wrong tree here. And I mean, really the wrong tree. Everything you are
talking about doing seems to add up to a set of band-aids that all fail to
address the core problems with audio on Android. Audio on Android is just
fine unless you care about latency. None of these proposed integrations
with PA are going to make it a platform that can begin to compare with iOS
for music/pro-audio apps.

Ironically, I was talking to a guy at Google who was trying to hire me
yesterday and I (mostly joking) said "the only thing I'd want to do at
Google is fix audio on Android". He then tried to convince me that he could
make that happen.
