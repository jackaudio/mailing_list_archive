&gt; Patrick, with the greatest respect, I think that you are totally barking
&gt; up
&gt; the wrong tree here. And I mean, really the wrong tree. Everything you are
&gt; talking about doing seems to add up to a set of band-aids that all fail to
&gt; address the core problems with audio on Android. Audio on Android is just
&gt; fine unless you care about latency. None of these proposed integrations
&gt; with PA are going to make it a platform that can begin to compare with iOS
&gt; for music/pro-audio apps.
&gt;
&gt; Ironically, I was talking to a guy at Google who was trying to hire me
&gt; yesterday and I (mostly joking) said "the only thing I'd want to do at
&gt; Google is fix audio on Android". He then tried to convince me that he
&gt; could
&gt; make that happen.
&gt;

Actually this has nothing at all to do with Android. Google do not support
Pulse Audio and they have made it clear that they do not support JACK
either. I think it is a dead end trying to get Google to change their
position on that. They have proven with both Android and Chrome that they
care very little for the work that has been done on JACK for professional
audio.

This is about getting JACK onto the *other* Linux mobile platforms that
already support PA by default.

Tizen, Ubuntu Mobile, HP WebOS, Jolla, etc...

The only way to make that happen is to address the various issues outlined
in this thread.

I know for a fact that I am not the only person in the whole world who
wants to see JACK running on mobile platforms other than iOS.

JACK is a very powerful and flexible solution for professional audio. If
you think that it is actually inferior to coreaudio I will have to
politely disagree with you.

We have two choices.

1: Add support to JACK so that it can be a drop in replacement for PA
2: Optimise PA so that it can provide the most efficient combination while
JAK is running

Which is the preferred option and who is going to do the work?

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Recently there have been discussions about the viability of getting
&gt;&gt; official JACK support into the mobile audio stack. Currently JACK is
&gt;&gt; left
&gt;&gt; out of the mix and Pulse Audio is the default audio system layer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For most consumer mobile use cases this is not a problem but when it
&gt;&gt; comes
&gt;&gt; to professional audio and some specific cases with very hard time limits
&gt;&gt; for the audio graph JACK can actually be preferable over the PA API and
&gt;&gt; logic.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A few things have been identified that make it hard to just drop JACK
&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt; the mobile audio stack at this point.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1: Bluetooth support especially for hands free audio
&gt;&gt; 2: "Murphy" system daemon support
&gt;&gt; 3: Dealing gracefully with apps that use the PA api
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On the PA mailing list we have identified several optimisations that can
&gt;&gt; be done to PA that would allow PA and JACK to coexist peacefully and
&gt;&gt; cause
&gt;&gt; minimal system disruption from the developer/user perspective.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; However, they are mostly required to allow JACK to run and that is not a
&gt;&gt; core priority for the PA developers. On the other hand it seems that
&gt;&gt; JACK
&gt;&gt; developers are not going to be interested in spending time on optimising
&gt;&gt; PA.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So this leads to a slight issue. Is it likely that JACK will be able to
&gt;&gt; support both the Bluez and Murphy API's in order to be a drop in
&gt;&gt; replacement for PA while it is running on a mobile OS? Or is it better
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; put the time into optimising PA so that we don't have to double up on
&gt;&gt; development efforts considering that the PA developers already provide
&gt;&gt; Bluez and Murphy support and are funded to work on that part of the
&gt;&gt; audio
&gt;&gt; layer?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The optimisations that would enable PA to work better with JACK are not
&gt;&gt; trivial and will require some pretty heavy thought and a fair sized
&gt;&gt; chunk
&gt;&gt; of time commitment to make them happen.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Its possible that we could get some assistance from the Linux Foundation
&gt;&gt; for the development process if we have a good plan and they agree that
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; is an important project. In addition several of the PA developers work
&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; Intel and Ubuntu so there might be some support from those areas to
&gt;&gt; provide a fully professional and highly optimised audio stack for Linux
&gt;&gt; based mobile OS's.
