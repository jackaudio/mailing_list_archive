Actually this has nothing at all to do with Android. Google do not support
Pulse Audio and they have made it clear that they do not support JACK
either. I think it is a dead end trying to get Google to change their
position on that. They have proven with both Android and Chrome that they
care very little for the work that has been done on JACK for professional
audio.

This is about getting JACK onto the *other* Linux mobile platforms that
already support PA by default.

Tizen, Ubuntu Mobile, HP WebOS, Jolla, etc...

The only way to make that happen is to address the various issues outlined
in this thread.

I know for a fact that I am not the only person in the whole world who
wants to see JACK running on mobile platforms other than iOS.

JACK is a very powerful and flexible solution for professional audio. If
you think that it is actually inferior to coreaudio I will have to
politely disagree with you.

We have two choices.

1: Add support to JACK so that it can be a drop in replacement for PA
2: Optimise PA so that it can provide the most efficient combination while
JAK is running

Which is the preferred option and who is going to do the work?
