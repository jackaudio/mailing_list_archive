&gt;&gt; Patrick, with the greatest respect, I think that you are totally barking
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt; the wrong tree here. And I mean, really the wrong tree. Everything you are
&gt;&gt; talking about doing seems to add up to a set of band-aids that all fail to
&gt;&gt; address the core problems with audio on Android. Audio on Android is just
&gt;&gt; fine unless you care about latency. None of these proposed integrations
&gt;&gt; with PA are going to make it a platform that can begin to compare with iOS
&gt;&gt; for music/pro-audio apps.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Ironically, I was talking to a guy at Google who was trying to hire me
&gt;&gt; yesterday and I (mostly joking) said "the only thing I'd want to do at
&gt;&gt; Google is fix audio on Android". He then tried to convince me that he
&gt;&gt; could
&gt;&gt; make that happen.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually this has nothing at all to do with Android. Google do not support
&gt; Pulse Audio and they have made it clear that they do not support JACK
&gt; either. I think it is a dead end trying to get Google to change their
&gt; position on that. They have proven with both Android and Chrome that they
&gt; care very little for the work that has been done on JACK for professional
&gt; audio.
&gt; 
&gt; This is about getting JACK onto the *other* Linux mobile platforms that
&gt; already support PA by default.
&gt; 
&gt; Tizen, Ubuntu Mobile, HP WebOS, Jolla, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; The only way to make that happen is to address the various issues outlined
&gt; in this thread.
&gt; 
&gt; I know for a fact that I am not the only person in the whole world who
&gt; wants to see JACK running on mobile platforms other than iOS.
&gt; 
&gt; JACK is a very powerful and flexible solution for professional audio. If
&gt; you think that it is actually inferior to coreaudio I will have to
&gt; politely disagree with you.
&gt; 
&gt; We have two choices.
&gt; 
&gt; 1: Add support to JACK so that it can be a drop in replacement for PA
&gt; 2: Optimise PA so that it can provide the most efficient combination while
&gt; JAK is running
&gt; 
&gt; Which is the preferred option and who is going to do the work?
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Recently there have been discussions about the viability of getting
&gt;&gt;&gt; official JACK support into the mobile audio stack. Currently JACK is
&gt;&gt;&gt; left
&gt;&gt;&gt; out of the mix and Pulse Audio is the default audio system layer.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; For most consumer mobile use cases this is not a problem but when it
&gt;&gt;&gt; comes
&gt;&gt;&gt; to professional audio and some specific cases with very hard time limits
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the audio graph JACK can actually be preferable over the PA API and
&gt;&gt;&gt; logic.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; A few things have been identified that make it hard to just drop JACK
&gt;&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt;&gt; the mobile audio stack at this point.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1: Bluetooth support especially for hands free audio
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2: "Murphy" system daemon support
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3: Dealing gracefully with apps that use the PA api
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; On the PA mailing list we have identified several optimisations that can
&gt;&gt;&gt; be done to PA that would allow PA and JACK to coexist peacefully and
&gt;&gt;&gt; cause
&gt;&gt;&gt; minimal system disruption from the developer/user perspective.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, they are mostly required to allow JACK to run and that is not a
&gt;&gt;&gt; core priority for the PA developers. On the other hand it seems that
&gt;&gt;&gt; JACK
&gt;&gt;&gt; developers are not going to be interested in spending time on optimising
&gt;&gt;&gt; PA.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; So this leads to a slight issue. Is it likely that JACK will be able to
&gt;&gt;&gt; support both the Bluez and Murphy API's in order to be a drop in
&gt;&gt;&gt; replacement for PA while it is running on a mobile OS? Or is it better
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; put the time into optimising PA so that we don't have to double up on
&gt;&gt;&gt; development efforts considering that the PA developers already provide
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bluez and Murphy support and are funded to work on that part of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; audio
&gt;&gt;&gt; layer?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The optimisations that would enable PA to work better with JACK are not
&gt;&gt;&gt; trivial and will require some pretty heavy thought and a fair sized
&gt;&gt;&gt; chunk
&gt;&gt;&gt; of time commitment to make them happen.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Its possible that we could get some assistance from the Linux Foundation
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the development process if we have a good plan and they agree that
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is an important project. In addition several of the PA developers work
&gt;&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt; Intel and Ubuntu so there might be some support from those areas to
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide a fully professional and highly optimised audio stack for Linux
&gt;&gt;&gt; based mobile OS's.
