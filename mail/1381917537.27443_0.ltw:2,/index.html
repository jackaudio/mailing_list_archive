&gt; Hi St&#xE9;phane,

&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason I chose to add code to JACK 2 is because C++ afforded me

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Which is by itself quite a real argument&#x85; ((-;
&gt; 
&gt; Sure.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; At that time, my feeling was that your C++ MIDI backend architecture
&gt;&gt; was quite elegant and could be inserted quite easily in the global
&gt;&gt; backend model.
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate the compliment.  Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I prefer the architecture and code structure of JACK 1.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; You preferred JACK1 code structure, but you coded in C++. So why
&gt;&gt; in the first place?
&gt; 
&gt; JACK 1 has a simpler codebase.  In my experience, when I've wanted to
&gt; understand how any particular thing works in JACK 1 vs. how it works
&gt; in JACK 2, I've had a much easier time figuring out how things work in
&gt; JACK 1.  However, my own designs are generally object-oriented, so if
&gt; I want to add a significant amount of code to a project, I'm less
&gt; inclined to do so if the project itself isn't object-oriented.
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't to say that JACK 1 doesn't have anything resembling
&gt; object-oriented architecture.  It's driver system, for example, is
&gt; basically object-oriented, even though the bindings are modular
&gt; because C is in use.  Speaking of the driver design ...
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyway this discussion is again coming to an end: the result of all
&gt;&gt; this years is that people generally criticize, but *never* provide any
&gt;&gt; real significant re-structure/improvement ideas, new code design&#x85;
&gt;&gt; etc&#x85;
&gt; 
&gt; A few years ago, I would have had more to say (and did, at times,
&gt; IIRC).  I'm not as familiar with the JACK 2 codebase as I used to be.
&gt; 
&gt; And you're right - it's not fair for me to express my dislike of the
&gt; JACK 2 architecture, design, etc. and not give some specifics.
&gt; 
&gt; One problem I remember trying to wrap my head around was the Open
&gt; functions in the JACK 2 driver system.  Let's take a brief look at
&gt; those now.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.) The JackDriverInterface class has three pure virtual Open()
&gt; functions.  IIRC, there isn't one driver I've seen that implements all
&gt; three of these functions.  That's confusing.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.) Then there's the JackDriver class that extends the
&gt; JackDriverInterface class.  The class is meant to be a base class, but
&gt; it implements all three of the virtual functions.  These
&gt; implementations are meant to be called by subclasses that override the
&gt; JackDriver virtual functions, which is an ugly anti-pattern.  If
&gt; JackDriver's Open functions are called without the overriding wrapper
&gt; function, then hilarity may ensue when the underlying JackDriver part
&gt; of the class thinks the driver has been successfully opened.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.) There's also JackThreadDriver, which also extends the
&gt; JackDriverInterface class (not JackDriver!).  It also provides
&gt; implementations for the three Open functions, one of which just fails
&gt; by returning -1.  If the JackThreadDriver class doesn't need some of
&gt; the API from the JackDriverInterface class, then either
&gt; JackDriverInterface should be changed, or JackThreadDriver shouldn't
&gt; extend JackDriverInterface.

I agree that the Driver class architecture is far from simple&#x85; "historical" reasons for the main part...

&gt; 
&gt; 4.) Speaking of returning -1 for non-realtime errors, I'm of the
&gt; opinion that throwing exceptions is a fantastic way to handle errors.

Here this is a kind of legacy of the pure C approach, C++ exception came after that, thus this "ugly" mix of the two approaches.

&gt; It's okay to write data to stderr and to indicate that some sort of
&gt; error happened, but it's even better to throw an exception containing
&gt; a reason for the error occurring so that it can be handled at an
&gt; appropriate place for handling errors.  Also, not checking return
&gt; values for error codes again and again is a good thing.  Note that
&gt; JACK 1 also has this problem; however, given that it's written in C,
&gt; I'm a little more forgiving.
&gt; 

&gt; 5.) I said before that there isn't one driver I've seen that
&gt; implements all three of the Open() functions.  Looking through the
&gt; Linux-specific drivers, I see that JACKAlsaDriver and
&gt; JackALSARawMidiDriver (I wrote that one) implement only one Open()
&gt; function each.  Here's a bit of a curve ball - JackFreebobDriver and
&gt; JackFFADODriver each define an Open function with a completely
&gt; different signature!

Not my fault actually, I did not wrote this code&#x85;.

&gt;  So, why does JackDriverInterface have a public
&gt; definition for Open() functions that may never be used, and aren't
&gt; meant to be used at all at times?
&gt; 
&gt; So, there's an example.  It's likely too little, too late, but
&gt; hopefully you can generalize some of what I'm talking about to the
&gt; rest of the code, because the problems above can be found in more
&gt; places than just the Open() functions of Jack drivers.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
