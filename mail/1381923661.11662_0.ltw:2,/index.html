&gt; 
&gt; A few years ago, I would have had more to say (and did, at times,
&gt; IIRC).  I'm not as familiar with the JACK 2 codebase as I used to be.
&gt; 
&gt; And you're right - it's not fair for me to express my dislike of the
&gt; JACK 2 architecture, design, etc. and not give some specifics.
&gt; 
&gt; One problem I remember trying to wrap my head around was the Open
&gt; functions in the JACK 2 driver system.  Let's take a brief look at
&gt; those now.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.) The JackDriverInterface class has three pure virtual Open()
&gt; functions.  IIRC, there isn't one driver I've seen that implements all
&gt; three of these functions.  That's confusing.
&gt; 
OK, I've just remove one of the Open method that was not really necessary (pushed on GIT)


&gt; 2.) Then there's the JackDriver class that extends the
&gt; JackDriverInterface class.  The class is meant to be a base class, but
&gt; it implements all three of the virtual functions.  These
&gt; implementations are meant to be called by subclasses that override the
&gt; JackDriver virtual functions, which is an ugly anti-pattern.

Well the point is to have JackDriver implement *common* cases, and sub-classes possibly re-implement the Open methods, calling the *generic* case and then adding their specific stuff. 


&gt;  If
&gt; JackDriver's Open functions are called without the overriding wrapper
&gt; function, then hilarity may ensue when the underlying JackDriver part
&gt; of the class thinks the driver has been successfully opened.

Yes right, this is a pattern I had already seen elsewhere, what would you suggest as a better model?

&gt; 
&gt; 3.) There's also JackThreadDriver, which also extends the
&gt; JackDriverInterface class (not JackDriver!).

Yes the JackThreadDriver class is meant as a decorator kind of pattern, so implementing the "interface", so JackDriverInterface class

&gt;  It also provides
&gt; implementations for the three Open functions, one of which just fails
&gt; by returning -1.

Removed.


&gt;  If the JackThreadDriver class doesn't need some of
&gt; the API from the JackDriverInterface class, then either
&gt; JackDriverInterface should be changed, or JackThreadDriver shouldn't
&gt; extend JackDriverInterface.

The decorator pattern redirects call on the decorated object, and possibly implement specific stuff in some method.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.) Speaking of returning -1 for non-realtime errors, I'm of the
&gt; opinion that throwing exceptions is a fantastic way to handle errors.
&gt; It's okay to write data to stderr and to indicate that some sort of
&gt; error happened, but it's even better to throw an exception containing
&gt; a reason for the error occurring so that it can be handled at an
&gt; appropriate place for handling errors.  Also, not checking return
&gt; values for error codes again and again is a good thing.  Note that
&gt; JACK 1 also has this problem; however, given that it's written in C,
&gt; I'm a little more forgiving.

What would you suggest as a was to better use exceptions in the backend class hierarchy?
&gt; 
&gt; 5.) I said before that there isn't one driver I've seen that
&gt; implements all three of the Open() functions.  Looking through the
&gt; Linux-specific drivers, I see that JACKAlsaDriver and
&gt; JackALSARawMidiDriver (I wrote that one) implement only one Open()
&gt; function each.  Here's a bit of a curve ball - JackFreebobDriver and
&gt; JackFFADODriver each define an Open function with a completely
&gt; different signature!  So, why does JackDriverInterface have a public
&gt; definition for Open() functions that may never be used, and aren't
&gt; meant to be used at all at times?

The Open(&#x85;.) is supposed to be used by subclasses to do the *generic* Open. Some subclasses (JACKAlsaDrivee, JackFFADODriver, JackFreebobDriver) have chosen a different prototype for their specific version, but sill use the generic Open one. I don't se that as a real problem

&gt; 
&gt; So, there's an example.  It's likely too little, too late, but
&gt; hopefully you can generalize some of what I'm talking about to the
&gt; rest of the code, because the problems above can be found in more
&gt; places than just the Open() functions of Jack drivers.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
