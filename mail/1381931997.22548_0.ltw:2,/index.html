&gt; I know for a fact that I am not the only person in the whole world who
&gt; wants to see JACK running on mobile platforms other than iOS.
&gt;

You're not. I'd be very happy to see Android be a suitable platform for
music creation and pro-audio applications. That isn't going to happen given
the current underlying technology in Android.

Regarding other mobile technologies, I would direct you to one of Brian
Lunduke's talks

(remember there is a companion video to this one).


&gt;
&gt; JACK is a very powerful and flexible solution for professional audio. If
&gt; you think that it is actually inferior to coreaudio I will have to
&gt; politely disagree with you.
&gt;

It isn't inferior to any native audio API because it relies on them all and
does something different. However, what CoreAudio does do (which neither
ALSA nor ASIO do) is provide a native API that works very well for both
consumer, mobile and pro-audio/music creation apps that all have widely
differing needs. ALSA can be used to get close, but to do things right,
ALSA needs to be involved and to be modified/extended.


&gt;
&gt; We have two choices.
&gt;
&gt; 1: Add support to JACK so that it can be a drop in replacement for PA
&gt; 2: Optimise PA so that it can provide the most efficient combination while
&gt; JAK is running
&gt;

3. Provide a proper native API on the platform.

Coming up with a solution to the PulseAudio/JACK situation ought to be the
goal of a well-funded Linux-wide project because it also involves ALSA and
the desktop. To do it properly requires a lot more than hacks to either PA
or JACK.
