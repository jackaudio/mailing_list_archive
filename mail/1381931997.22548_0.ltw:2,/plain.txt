You're not. I'd be very happy to see Android be a suitable platform for
music creation and pro-audio applications. That isn't going to happen given
the current underlying technology in Android.

Regarding other mobile technologies, I would direct you to one of Brian
Lunduke's talks

(remember there is a companion video to this one).

It isn't inferior to any native audio API because it relies on them all and
does something different. However, what CoreAudio does do (which neither
ALSA nor ASIO do) is provide a native API that works very well for both
consumer, mobile and pro-audio/music creation apps that all have widely
differing needs. ALSA can be used to get close, but to do things right,
ALSA needs to be involved and to be modified/extended.

3. Provide a proper native API on the platform.

Coming up with a solution to the PulseAudio/JACK situation ought to be the
goal of a well-funded Linux-wide project because it also involves ALSA and
the desktop. To do it properly requires a lot more than hacks to either PA
or JACK.
