&gt; I do have a question regarding iOS and audio latency. Does anyone on this
&gt; list have reliable metrics? I have seen some low figures reported on
&gt; Internet postings. However, figures I have encountered from individuals who
&gt; actually measured it seem out of range for pro audio.

JACK iOS (RIP) was configurable down to 2.9ms

	http://www.crudebyte.com/jack-ios/jack_ios_shot_3.png

which worked reliable on all iOS devices we tested (while running multiple 
audio apps simultaneously), even on older devices. Probably even lower 
latencies are possible, but we actually never tested going below that buffer 
size (due to other priorities). What I found interesting was that even ancient 
iPhone 1 devices provided reliable low latency.

I have a big sympathy for modern Mach derivative kernels, even though Apple's 
XNU kernel (Mac &amp; iOS) is not top-notch anymore, it still solves things very 
elegant and efficiently. I would love to see some L4 microkernel to enter a 
major distro as alternative to the Linux kernel in future. But due to the old 
problems of i.e. missing drivers, alternative kernels won't have a chance on 
major open source distros that soon I fear ...
