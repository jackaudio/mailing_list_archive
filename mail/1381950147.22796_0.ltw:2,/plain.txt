In selling a previous product I found market resistance to any number above
the 4 to 5 ms range. For more than a few professional musicians a number
larger than 0 was unacceptable; this of course is an unobtainable goal.

For the amateur musician market the number would be softer.

I have no personal opinion, I don't have a musician's ears. I do not know
if our customers were truly sensitive to latency at these levels, but their
purchases are determined by what they believe.
