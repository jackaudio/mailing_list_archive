&gt; &gt;What do you call a latency that isn't good for pro-audio?
&gt; 
&gt; In selling a previous product I found market resistance to any number above
&gt; the 4 to 5 ms range. For more than a few professional musicians a number
&gt; larger than 0 was unacceptable; this of course is an unobtainable goal.
&gt; 
&gt; For the amateur musician market the number would be softer.
&gt; 
&gt; I have no personal opinion, I don't have a musician's ears. I do not know
&gt; if our customers were truly sensitive to latency at these levels, but their
&gt; purchases are determined by what they believe.

It depends on the application. I typically use the maximum latency possible
with my interface hardware for multitrack recording (about 21ms at 48kHz sample
rate). If monitoring direct from interface hardware or mixing desk, short
latency isn't required for straighforward recording and overdubbing.

Short latency _is_ required when monitoring from software, but it doesn't
necessarily follow that lack of short latency rules out all pro audio work.
