It depends on the application. I typically use the maximum latency possible
with my interface hardware for multitrack recording (about 21ms at 48kHz sample
rate). If monitoring direct from interface hardware or mixing desk, short
latency isn't required for straighforward recording and overdubbing.

Short latency _is_ required when monitoring from software, but it doesn't
necessarily follow that lack of short latency rules out all pro audio work.
