Well Christian you are speaking of the 2 * buffer size latency here right? 

OSX usually decompose I/O latency as = AD conversion latency + input latency offset + 2 * buffer size +  output latency offset + DA conversion latency

So I would guess the minimal I/O latency on IOS is more than the 2.9 ms value.
