Yes, exactly.

Or if the use case is a soft synth with ext. keyboard, you must at least add
1.0 ms on input chain side because of the minimum theoretical USB polling 
interval (for "low" & "full speed" USB endpoints that is, which are still used 
in most USB MIDI controllers), plus probably even more for poor demultiplexers 
in inexpensive keyboards, etc.

So if the original question was rather precise total end to end latency 
measurements, then sorry, cannot serve. ;-)
