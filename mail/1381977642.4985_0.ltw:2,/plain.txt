There are no real issues with running PA on top of JACK when you combine
the right version of PA with the right version of JACK. I'm not sure what
problems you think exist - it would be interesting to hear about them. As
far as I understand it both PA and JACK developers consider this a done
deal in each technology, but one subject to distribution/platform
capabilities to make it work or make it fail.

Work apparently. From your opening message in this thread:

  "The optimisations that would enable PA to work better with JACK are not
trivial and will require some pretty heavy thought and a fair sized chunk
of time commitment to make them happen."

It sounds as if you want someone to do some work on this for no other
reason that mobile platforms are cool, or something. Oh, except it doesn't
actually the MAJOR linux-y mobile platform at all. There is already a
massive shortage of resources to put towards JACK development. Maybe some
one new will take up your call to arms, and if so, great. Really.

But looking at the "existing" JACK development community as if this is
something that anyone here is obligated (or frankly, even likely) to be
interested in ... well, to me it is just silly.

You talk below about "various consortiums of large multinational companies
that would be supporting this step" - why don't they create a paid position
to do whatever it is that needs doing, away from the noise of this list. It
would be more efficient, and more likely to get someone to actually do it.

The thing is Patrick, you are talking platforms with tiny market share.
JACK is a community of people focused mostly on music creation and
pro-audio. The market you are talking about (in terms of devices) is close
to meaningless. Linux isn't a big enough market already for this stuff
(barely) and now you want to sell us on various secondary linux-y mobile
platforms as the new big thing? Sorry, I'm not buying it. I'm not trying to
be antagonistic, but you write about this stuff as if it ought to be bloody
obvious to everyone how awesomely cool this is. All I see are more variants
on meego or whatever that end up with essentially no market and certainly
none of the excitement that exists within the iOS music creation/pro-audio
community.

Actually, the seem to have gone further than that, unfortunately.

They don't understand the issues, at least it appears to be that way.

Not a new audio system. All Linux based systems have access to a perfectly
viable audio subsystem. Its name is ALSA. Mobile platforms just want to
avoid exposing it (or even using it). Why? And why should we have to cater
to that?

It cannot run on iOS anymore. You missed the news, apparently.

This is just stupid. I think PA is a pretty awesome system. In some ways, I
may even be responsible for its adoption, having urged this very early at
Ye Olde Linux Desktop Architects meetings back in the early 2000s. I have
nothing but respect for PA. My respect is tempered with an understanding of
its deliberate design limitations, which happen to be roughly opposite
those of JACK.

Instead of asking for volunteer help, why don't you try to actually hire
someone?
