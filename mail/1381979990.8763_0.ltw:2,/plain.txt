As i said in the opening message there is a possibility that the Linux
Foundation could be interested in funding the development process if we
can come up with a viable plan. I have already committed my own funds to
funding myself to do the work required to get things to this point in the
process. Trust me when I say my wife is not happy about my decision to use
my time in this way. Its not just a case of sitting down and writing some
code. It also requires communicating with multiple "stakeholders" in order
to keep things progressing forward and gain insight into the issues that
need to be resolved. At any rate I am probably not the best person to
write the code that is required.

However while other communities have been very supportive, the results
round here so far have been people ignoring the actual topic of
discussion, focusing on Android development or denial of the viability of
optimising PA so that PA and JACK will work together more reliably on the
OTHER Linux mobile platforms that run PA by default and in the process
better on the desktop too.

In regards to the combination of PA and JACK being a done deal,
unfortunately there are several issues that have been exposed through
recent tests that have been run on the current stable versions of JACK and
PA. The issues are all inside of PA but they can be fixed if there is a
consensus or interest from JACK developers for such an effort. The fixes
are unlikely to come from PA developers as it is not exactly in their
priority list (or personal interests) to put their time/effort into
optimisations specifically to enable PA to run more efficiently on top of
JACK. Apart from that, doesn't it strike you as fairly unprofessional if
we require users to run specific combinations of JACK + PA in order to get
a completely reliable and stable desktop audio system?

- There is a bug in jack source/sink which allows the buffer to grow
continuously
- There is an issue with realtime capabilities in jack source/sink that
needs to be debugged
- It would be useful to make several optimisations to PA to enable even
faster realtime processes like optionally bypassing the Stream Buffer
while JACK is running but that will require some major design changes to
the PA graph and also some threading work to split out control and audio.

I know there are lots of people who advocate disabling PA in order to use
JACK but what about all the people who don't or cannot do that? Surely
they are the majority when it comes to desktop users and absolutely the
majority when it comes to OTHER mobile platforms that use PA as the
default audio management system.

So unless we want to go with option 2 which is to add and maintain support
for Bluez, Murphy and PA API in JACK are there people willing to work on
the PA optimisations that have been identified and if so what would be the
motivator to make it viable? Should we be looking to the Linux Foundation
or other well funded organisations to support us in this process? Can we
do it ourselves with the motivation that we can sell our products on these
OTHER Mobile platforms that run PA as the default audio management system?
Are there people who want to do the work just because they feel the urge
to contribute to the greater good and make open source desktop audio as
good as it can possibly be like in the good ol days before Linux became
the most popular operating system on the planet and the GFC began when
people had plenty of time on their hands to do awesome shizzle just
because they felt like it with no financial motivator (or was that a dream
reality that never really existed anyway)?
