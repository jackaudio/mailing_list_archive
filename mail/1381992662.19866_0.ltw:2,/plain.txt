For what it's worth.  I run KDE on Archlinux and haven't had PA
installed for years (seems like all/most packages are built with a PA
dependency nowdays, but I don't have the server component
running nor do I have it installed) .

KDE works perfectly fine with bare ALSA. I also sometimes use the ALSA
loopback together with alsa_in/out to connect KDE, Skype, Steam,
Wine, XBMC, etc to JACK, and that works perfectly fine too, (at low
latencies too if that is a requisite).  I also routinely run reaper and
all sorts of other windows plugins and virtual instruments using
Wineasio with jack at low latencies.
