Patrick - as a disinterested observer it seems to me that you and Paul are talking apples and oranges here.  Your focus is entirely on the technical challenges involved whereas Paul is questioning the market viability - i.e. what evidence is there that users want to run pro-audio apps on mobile platforms?.

Remember that Jack is little more than a facilitator.  It doesn't do much that's useful in its own right.  Even if you could get to the stage where Jack was running acceptably on the desired platforms, more people would need to come forward to build the apps (or to adapt existing ones).  Or to put it another way, Jack would be just the first step on a long journey.  Assuming you could find someone who'd take that first step, is there any evidence that others would take up the baton and run the rest of the way?

I've never had any dealings with the Linux Foundation but I'd imagine that any plan would need to stipulate who's going to carry on the work, after their own initial funding.  Those are the people you need to find and get on board.  If you could identify some people who'd fund (or volunteer to do) the rest of the work (subject to the Linux Foundation funding the initial Jack step) I think you'd have a far stronger case.
