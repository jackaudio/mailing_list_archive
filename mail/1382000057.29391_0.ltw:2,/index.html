V. interesting news Bradley - it seems to have totally gone over Pat's
head, unless he replied to you privately.

It sounds like your Android JACK port isn't functional yet but is someway
towards working. Will we need to flash a custom JACK distro to use your
port or will it eventually be available as a regular apk for anyone to
install?

Christian:

JACK iOS is dead already? Why? There is no mention or explanation of its
passing on its homepage that I can see.

&gt; Very interesting comments on pro audio and mobile platforms, lots here to
&gt; investigate.
&gt;
&gt; I have been looking at Android as a platform for pro audio applications. I
&gt; am also convinced that true low latency audio on mainstream Android is not
&gt; an achievable goal. Google priorities, e.g. maintaining call quality and
&gt; low power consumption, render it so. What is achievable is the more modest
&gt; goal of an Android distribution specifically instrumented for pro audio
&gt; applications. This is still a worthy goal, especially if you consider
&gt; Android as an embedded system that can run on a low cost dedicated device.
&gt;
&gt; I have a functional prototype of a pro audio Android distribution running
&gt; on the Nexus 7. At the end of round 1 of the latency wars I am reliably
&gt; running Simple Client using USB audio at 96k with buffers set at 512 X 2.
&gt; To accomplish this, JACK and its clients run in native space directly on
&gt; top of ALSA with client user interfaces running as standard Java Android
&gt; activities. I am currently finishing up work on client installation and
&gt; configuration; I hope to return to the latency issue soon. There are
&gt; approaches I have yet to explore, such as application of the real-time
&gt; patches.
&gt;
&gt; This work highlights the critical difference between Android and iOS: with
&gt; iOS you are restricted to what Apple decides to provide in terms of
&gt; hardware and system software. With Android, if there is a problem that
&gt; needs corrected, such as audio drivers, you have the ability to do so.
&gt;
&gt; I do have a question regarding iOS and audio latency. Does anyone on this
&gt; list have reliable metrics? I have seen some low figures reported on
&gt; Internet postings. However, figures I have encountered from individuals who
&gt; actually measured it seem out of range for pro audio.
