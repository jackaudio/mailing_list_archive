Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK on mobile

V. interesting news Bradley - it seems to have totally gone over Pat's
head, unless he replied to you privately.

It sounds like your Android JACK port isn't functional yet but is someway
towards working. Will we need to flash a custom JACK distro to use your
port or will it eventually be available as a regular apk for anyone to
install?

Christian:

JACK iOS is dead already? Why? There is no mention or explanation of its
passing on its homepage that I can see.
