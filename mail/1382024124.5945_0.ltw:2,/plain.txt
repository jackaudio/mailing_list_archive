Yes, I explained it in detail just hours ago on this list (search for subject 
"JACK iOS (RIP)").

In peace, or rather comatose, but it's unlikely that it will ever wake up from 
that coma, simply because it's caused by a new sandbox restriction in iOS7 
which is obviously not in our hands.

And once a user updated his device to a new iOS version, he can never step 
back to a previous iOS version. Which makes the situation even more ultimate.
