Hi St&#xE9;phane,

&gt;&gt; 2.) Then there's the JackDriver class that extends the
&gt;&gt; JackDriverInterface class.  The class is meant to be a base class, but
&gt;&gt; it implements all three of the virtual functions.  These
&gt;&gt; implementations are meant to be called by subclasses that override the
&gt;&gt; JackDriver virtual functions, which is an ugly anti-pattern.
&gt;
&gt; Well the point is to have JackDriver implement *common* cases, and
&gt; sub-classes possibly re-implement the Open methods, calling the
&gt; *generic* case and then adding their specific stuff.

I'm not sure there's a well-defined generic case here.

&gt;&gt;  If
&gt;&gt; JackDriver's Open functions are called without the overriding wrapper
&gt;&gt; function, then hilarity may ensue when the underlying JackDriver part
&gt;&gt; of the class thinks the driver has been successfully opened.
&gt;
&gt; Yes right, this is a pattern I had already seen elsewhere, what would
&gt; you suggest as a better model?

See my previous message. :)

&gt;&gt; 3.) There's also JackThreadDriver, which also extends the
&gt;&gt; JackDriverInterface class (not JackDriver!).
&gt;
&gt; Yes the JackThreadDriver class is meant as a decorator kind of
&gt; pattern, so implementing the "interface", so JackDriverInterface
&gt; class

Yes.  I tend to like the decorator pattern, as long as it's not
overused.  The confusing part is that JackThreadedDriver appears to be
a class that Jack uses internally to wrap a driver, and isn't for
driver development itself.

I suppose this problem goes away if you have a well-defined driver
development API.

&gt;&gt; 4.) Speaking of returning -1 for non-realtime errors, I'm of the
&gt;&gt; opinion that throwing exceptions is a fantastic way to handle errors.
&gt;&gt; It's okay to write data to stderr and to indicate that some sort of
&gt;&gt; error happened, but it's even better to throw an exception containing
&gt;&gt; a reason for the error occurring so that it can be handled at an
&gt;&gt; appropriate place for handling errors.  Also, not checking return
&gt;&gt; values for error codes again and again is a good thing.  Note that
&gt;&gt; JACK 1 also has this problem; however, given that it's written in C,
&gt;&gt; I'm a little more forgiving.
&gt;
&gt; What would you suggest as a was to better use exceptions in the
&gt; backend class hierarchy?

I'd like to see exceptions used to indicate errors instead of return
codes such that instead of errors being propagated up to where there
supposed to be handled by checking return codes over and over, an
exception is thrown and the callers that aren't interested in doing
any specific error handling can simply make sure they're using RAII in
case an exception happens, and the exception can be caught at the
point where error handling should occur.
