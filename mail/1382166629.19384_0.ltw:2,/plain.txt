I agree that this is a fair point. Today Android has a near monopoly on
the global market and iOS swallows up the rest in regards to professional
multimedia. I'm not sure which app store has the highest number of apps.
Didn't Google recently announce they had broken the 1 Billion mark? Or was
it Apple?

However, IMO the single biggest contributor to the success of Android is
the Samsung marketing department and they are now putting a lot of weight
behind Tizen along with Intel and several other prominent mobile
manufacturers. Tizen is backed by the Linux Foundation too and they are
seeking to create/maintain a *truly* open Linux mobile platform.

The modern mobile market is very dynamic and rapidly changing. Palm was
first, Microsoft followed with CE, they had huge market share for a while
but Nokia was dominant across the full spectrum, then came Apple with iOs
and they held the throne for a few short but impressive years, now it is 
Androids (Google/Samsung) turn. That won't last forever. Samsung competes
directly with Apple, Google and Nokia. Google are currently in the process
of ramping up a $500mil marketing campaign for their new Motorola product
line. Apple will not stand aside and Samsung are gunning to replace Google
as the biggest company in the word. The Koreans would absolutely love to
be the first to break the trillion dollar market capitalisation barrier.
It would be a huge boost to their national pride in the same way hosting
the FIFA world cup was. I was there during that period and it was a unique
experience to see the whole country respond in the way that they did. I'm
sure we all remember the chanting at the Korean matches and the sea of
red. Psychological warfare at the highest level.

In addition Canonical are also making serious moves with Ubuntu Mobile,
Firefox OS is on it's way to low cost devices, Jolla is finding it's way
onto devices and HP have been making rumbling noises about being in direct
competition with Microsoft so there is a high likelihood they will
redirect their attention to webOS which they made completely open source
about 6 months ago.

The mobile market is definitely not going away anytime in the near future
and is a significantly larger and more dynamic market than desktop
computers representing a huge opportunity for us developers too.

Don't forget that Valves, SteamOS is running Linux and they are taking on
the console market directly too which also means the TV market and home
entertainment in general.

There is also the automotive market. There are at least 2 prominent and
high end car companies that openly run Linux OS's and multimedia is a huge
part of the automotive experience. They have very hard time limits in
order to meet IEC standards compliance. 50ms for round trip from Bluetooth
headset to speakers and back again for hands free audio.

FYI, I am in contact with the Linux Foundation and *so far* they have been
supportive of my stated goals. However I am only a cog in the wheel so if
other people are behind this project I'm sure that will help if we get to
any kind of negotiations or requests for demo hardware.

As it stands various Pulse Audio developers particularly Tanu Kaskinen
(Intel) and David Henningson (Canonical) are putting some thought to the
issues that have been identified. I'm sure they will appreciate some
positive feedback on a purely technical level. The issues involved are
pushing the limits of expertise and they are not for the faint of heart
;-) After all we are talking about the most optimised system possible
within this modular framework that we have constructed.
