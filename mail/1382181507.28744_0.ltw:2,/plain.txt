John - latency matters for synth- and FX-related applications. Take a look
at the many different instruments that exist for iOS. To whatever extent
any of them are more than toys and actually represent something that can be
played, it is generally fairly critical that they can be used with low
latency. Yes, we all know about pipe organ players and their ability to
handle huge latencies between action + sound emission. And so yes, in fact
jitter is more important than latency. But ... for most people, if they
play something (either by touching it or touching a controller of some
kind) and the sound does not happen "immediately", then the experience is
less than satisfactory. The same is true when using the device as an FX box.

non-iOS platforms just can't do this properly, because their developers
haven't really cared too much about it. and why care? the music
creation/pro-audio market is not very big, and lots of people can make
money on apps that do audio stuff but still don't need low latency
(somewhat as you've noted).
