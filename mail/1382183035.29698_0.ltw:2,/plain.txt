That's an excellent example.  As someone who wasted far too much of my 
youth tinkering around in bands I can definitely relate to that. I was 
thinking of "pro" audio in terms of high-end sound recording / film  / 
television etc but software instruments are undoubtedly a much bigger 
market.

Assuming the technical challenges could be overcome, Patrick's best hope 
then is probably to line up some instrument and FX manufacturers to help 
progress his argument.
