JACK is not just about audio anymore, it has potential for 3d and video
data too.

Giving consumers access to JACK on their mobile devices will open up a
much larger market for open source creation and production tools and that
will in turn increase the revenue earning potential of developers who
provide support for JACK in their products. It will also increase
awareness of open source multimedia solutions.

Currently developers who would like to sell mobile apps that support JACK
are missing out on that opportunity. Consumers are missing out on the JACK
experience and opportunity to spend their money on those apps too. The
mobile market is significantly bigger than the desktop market so that
represents a loss of potential income and in the current global market
that is a wasted opportunity.

At the moment we just don't have the option but we have been given a
chance to get JACK accepted as a default application at the system level.
For the people who make those calls the issue is not if it can be done or
whether it is worth anyones time but what needs to be done, who is going
to make it happen and what does it take to get them interested and
motivated to do the hard graft.

It seems that no one else from the JACK community is seriously interested
in seeing JACK run on Linux based mobile OS's. Instead we are seeing Pulse
Audio developers leading the charge for optimising PA and in the process
making it easier to run JACK. There is something wrong with that picture.
It's a little bit like Nvidia developers writing the open source drivers
for AMD graphics cards. I am sure the PA developers will not intentionally
write bad code but I suspect that JACK developers will be better placed to
write or advise on optimal code for low latency and efficiency.
