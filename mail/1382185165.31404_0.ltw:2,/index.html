&gt;&gt; John - latency matters for synth- and FX-related applications. Take a
&gt;&gt; look at the many different instruments that exist for iOS. To whatever
&gt;&gt; extent any of them are more than toys and actually represent something
&gt;&gt; that can be played, it is generally fairly critical that they can be
&gt;&gt; used with low latency.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; That's an excellent example.  As someone who wasted far too much of my
&gt; youth tinkering around in bands I can definitely relate to that. I was
&gt; thinking of "pro" audio in terms of high-end sound recording / film  /
&gt; television etc but software instruments are undoubtedly a much bigger
&gt; market.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming the technical challenges could be overcome, Patrick's best hope
&gt; then is probably to line up some instrument and FX manufacturers to help
&gt; progress his argument.
&gt;

I'f I am not mistaken there are quite a few synth and FX software
developers in the Linux Audio Development community.

However they are unlikely to be the ones who solve the issues of PA
optimisation so that it can better interact with JACK. The people who
already wrote the existing plugins did the best job that they could at the
time. However the work that needs to be done to optimise PA to make it
work as efficiently as possible while JACK is running is stopping JACK
from being included as a default system level application for the Mobile
OS's that chose to support PA by default.

Its no ones fault that this has happened but it's also no ones specific
job to fix the issues that PA is showing when it comes to running it in
combination with JACK.

This is why I feel it is a project that the Linux Foundation should be
involved in. PA is currently a blocker for wider adoption of JACK and no
one is directly responsible for changing that.

However,  Intel and Canonical are already providing some resources towards
the optimisation effort so in that regard the issues are what can JACK
developers contribute and what do we need to make it viable for those
resources to contribute. If we can pitch something reasonable to the Linux
Foundation they might be able to support JACK developers to find the time
to get involved.

I'm estimating it will be at least three months of concerted effort to
really make something amazing happen given everyone already has a busy
schedule and can't just drop everything to work on this project.

So, in that case do we have a show of hands for people who will be
available or interested to take part?
