&gt; &gt; John - latency matters for synth- and FX-related applications. Take a

&gt; That's an excellent example.  As someone who wasted far too much of my

&gt; television etc but software instruments are undoubtedly a much bigger

I'd love if a phone could do guitar effects, and the tinier the better - to
 a certain extent. Latency matters here.

Tired of lugging my 90's effects rack unit. It has old style time-domain 
 pitch shifting. The phone would hopefully have enough power to do 
 high-quality pitch shifting (but of course that adds much latency anyway).
Slap a Guitarix instance in there for the awesome distortion/overdrive 
 and other effects, and I'm happy.

Currently I'm looking at buying a small net-book for this purpose,
 but hey if a phone could do it...

If the phone could handle midi input, even better, for virtual synths etc.
But whatever the device, I guess the only sane way into most devices 
 these days is with USB for both audio and midi?

Cheers.
Tim.
