&gt;&gt;&gt; John - latency matters for synth- and FX-related applications. Take a
&gt;&gt;&gt; look at the many different instruments that exist for iOS. To whatever

&gt;&gt;&gt; that can be played, it is generally fairly critical that they can be
&gt;&gt;&gt; used with low latency.
&gt;&gt; That's an excellent example.  As someone who wasted far too much of my
&gt;&gt; youth tinkering around in bands I can definitely relate to that. I was
&gt;&gt; thinking of "pro" audio in terms of high-end sound recording / film  /
&gt;&gt; television etc but software instruments are undoubtedly a much bigger
&gt;&gt; market.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Assuming the technical challenges could be overcome, Patrick's best hope
&gt;&gt; then is probably to line up some instrument and FX manufacturers to help
&gt;&gt; progress his argument.

&gt; I'd love if a phone could do guitar effects, and the tinier the better - to
&gt;   a certain extent. Latency matters here.
&gt;
&gt; Tired of lugging my 90's effects rack unit. It has old style time-domain
&gt;   pitch shifting. The phone would hopefully have enough power to do
&gt;   high-quality pitch shifting (but of course that adds much latency anyway).
&gt; Slap a Guitarix instance in there for the awesome distortion/overdrive
&gt;   and other effects, and I'm happy.
You can't run guitarix on your phone, but you can control it with your 
phone will running it on a pi or a cubiebord, or even on a net-book.
And that is were I see those little mobile devices right now, they are 
useable as control devices.
Last week I visit a concert from VolBeat in Birmingham, the sound 
engineer use a iPod to adjust the MIC's on stage.

&gt; Currently I'm looking at buying a small net-book for this purpose,
&gt;   but hey if a phone could do it...
&gt;
&gt; If the phone could handle midi input, even better, for virtual synths etc.
&gt; But whatever the device, I guess the only sane way into most devices
&gt;   these days is with USB for both audio and midi?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers.
&gt; Tim.
