You can't run guitarix on your phone, but you can control it with your 
phone will running it on a pi or a cubiebord, or even on a net-book.
And that is were I see those little mobile devices right now, they are 
useable as control devices.
Last week I visit a concert from VolBeat in Birmingham, the sound 
engineer use a iPod to adjust the MIC's on stage.
