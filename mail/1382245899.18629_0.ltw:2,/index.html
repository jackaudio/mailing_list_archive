&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; John - latency matters for synth- and FX-related applications. Take a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; look at the many different instruments that exist for iOS. To whatever
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; extent any of them are more than toys and actually represent something
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that can be played, it is generally fairly critical that they can be
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; used with low latency.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; That's an excellent example.  As someone who wasted far too much of my
&gt; &gt;&gt; youth tinkering around in bands I can definitely relate to that. I was
&gt; &gt;&gt; thinking of "pro" audio in terms of high-end sound recording / film  /
&gt; &gt;&gt; television etc but software instruments are undoubtedly a much bigger
&gt; &gt;&gt; market.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Assuming the technical challenges could be overcome, Patrick's best hope
&gt; &gt;&gt; then is probably to line up some instrument and FX manufacturers to help
&gt; &gt;&gt; progress his argument.

&gt; &gt; I'd love if a phone could do guitar effects, and the tinier the better -
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   a certain extent. Latency matters here.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tired of lugging my 90's effects rack unit. It has old style time-domain
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   pitch shifting. The phone would hopefully have enough power to do
&gt; &gt;   high-quality pitch shifting (but of course that adds much latency
&gt; &gt;   anyway).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Slap a Guitarix instance in there for the awesome distortion/overdrive
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   and other effects, and I'm happy.
&gt; 
&gt; You can't run guitarix on your phone, but you can control it with your
&gt; phone will running it on a pi or a cubiebord, or even on a net-book.
&gt; And that is were I see those little mobile devices right now, they are
&gt; useable as control devices.
&gt; Last week I visit a concert from VolBeat in Birmingham, the sound
&gt; engineer use a iPod to adjust the MIC's on stage.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Currently I'm looking at buying a small net-book for this purpose,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   but hey if a phone could do it...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If the phone could handle midi input, even better, for virtual synths etc.
&gt; &gt; But whatever the device, I guess the only sane way into most devices
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   these days is with USB for both audio and midi?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers.
&gt; &gt; Tim.

LOL The phone accidentally rings during a live gig through an amp stack.
"Uh, hello? Yes dear, I'll bring home some milk and bread!"
