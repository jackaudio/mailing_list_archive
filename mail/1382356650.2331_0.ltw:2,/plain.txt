JACK on mobile - mobile must not necessarily be a phone. It could be any
small & mobile (embedded?) device. The thing with the phone is just that
many have it at hand.
One of the use-cases where JACK could make sense on mobile devices is to
have a way to monitor audio anywhere in the graph remotely with low
latency. That would include a nicely working netjack or similar setup.
JACK just on the phone without any outside connections is not so
interesting IMHO.
The mobile is also a handy controller for anything on the 'big' machines,
but for that, no JACK is used.
