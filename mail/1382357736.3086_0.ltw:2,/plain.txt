Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK port's type field

Hi,
 
AFAIK: yes you assume that.
Currently Jack support two types of ports:

Audio:
#define JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE   "32 bit float mono audio"

Midi:
#define JACK_DEFAULT_MIDI_TYPE   "8 bit raw midi"

> Hi guys,  I'm looking at a bug in PortAudio's jack backend - when creating its device list, it includes Jack MIDI ports as audio channels.  I can see from the docs that I can pass JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE as the type parameter to jack_get_ports() to retrieve a list sans midi ports. However, this will also filter out all other port types, which I'm not sure is desirable.  So my question is, what is the intended purpose of the port's type? Is it reasonable to expect that all ports supporting 
audio streams will have type JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE? Thanks,-sqweek
