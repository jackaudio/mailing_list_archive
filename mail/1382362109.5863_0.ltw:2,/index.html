Right so telling others that you "don't know of anyone working on
combining PA and JACK together  for mobile platforms" is not a backhanded
insult?

Pot meet kettle.

Simply put, apparently, no one on this list wants to see JACK running on
mobile platforms other than iOS or Android. I get it.  It's good to know
because now I can focus on finding people who do care about that goal and
stop bothering the list with my obviously unnecessary posts.

It's all good!

I'll be sure to *not* update you all on my progress.

Classic!

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; JACK on mobile - mobile must not necessarily be a phone. It could be
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; &gt; small &amp; mobile (embedded?) device. The thing with the phone is just
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt; many have it at hand.
&gt;&gt; &gt; One of the use-cases where JACK could make sense on mobile devices is
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; have a way to monitor audio anywhere in the graph remotely with low
&gt;&gt; &gt; latency. That would include a nicely working netjack or similar setup.
&gt;&gt; &gt; JACK just on the phone without any outside connections is not so
&gt;&gt; &gt; interesting IMHO.
&gt;&gt; &gt; The mobile is also a handy controller for anything on the 'big'
&gt;&gt; machines,
&gt;&gt; &gt; but for that, no JACK is used.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ok, so the consensus appears to be that JACK developers have no interest
&gt;&gt; in seeing JACK actually run on mobile OS's (phone/tablet/etc...) and
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; it is considered a waste of time to put any effort into making it
&gt;&gt; possible?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is that correct?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Should I go back to the people who have opened the door to JACK as a
&gt;&gt; default component of the Mobile Audio Stack (excluding Android and iOS)
&gt;&gt; and tell them that?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Should I tell the people at the Linux Foundation that even if they are
&gt;&gt; interested in supporting the development process that none of the JACK
&gt;&gt; Developers are interested in taking part?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are we therefore expecting users who want to run JACK apps or developers
&gt;&gt; who want to develop JACK apps to only run desktop systems or Linux
&gt;&gt; embedded systems on devices like the Raspberry PI and that developers
&gt;&gt; should simply ignore the absolutely massive global mobile market place?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In other words if someone wants to run JACK on a mobile device they are
&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; there own and will not garner any interest from JACK Developers?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The over all consensus is that JACK is not useful or even needed on
&gt;&gt; mobile
&gt;&gt; devices. For example if I were to get it running on my Quad core ARM
&gt;&gt; tablet with 2GB of onboard RAM, built in SD and onboard sound device it
&gt;&gt; would be a futile and pointless waste of time because those kind of
&gt;&gt; resources have no value in a JACK'd system? Or that running JACK on a
&gt;&gt; brand new Intel Haswell  (16nm die) tablet made by Samsung running Tizen
&gt;&gt; (sponsored by the Linux Foundation) is going to be a waste of time
&gt;&gt; because, because, because... um , well because someones girlfriend might
&gt;&gt; call them while they are performing and obviously we wouldn't think of
&gt;&gt; making it possible for this performer to disable calls while they are
&gt;&gt; using their high powered Ubuntu Phone as a realtime FX box or god forbid
&gt;&gt; they have a tablet that doesn't even have GSM capabilities in the first
&gt;&gt; place and can't be used as a cellphone?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is that the correct assessment of interest from JACK developers in
&gt;&gt; getting
&gt;&gt; JACK to run on Mobile platforms that already support PA by default?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I smell a big whiff os BS in the air. Either that or JACK developers are
&gt;&gt; complete idiots and have no idea what they are doing. I was under the
&gt;&gt; impression that it was not the latter but maybe I am actually wrong
&gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt; that.
