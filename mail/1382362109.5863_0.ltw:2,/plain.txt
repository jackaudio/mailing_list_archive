Right so telling others that you "don't know of anyone working on
combining PA and JACK together  for mobile platforms" is not a backhanded
insult?

Pot meet kettle.

Simply put, apparently, no one on this list wants to see JACK running on
mobile platforms other than iOS or Android. I get it.  It's good to know
because now I can focus on finding people who do care about that goal and
stop bothering the list with my obviously unnecessary posts.

It's all good!

I'll be sure to *not* update you all on my progress.

Classic!
