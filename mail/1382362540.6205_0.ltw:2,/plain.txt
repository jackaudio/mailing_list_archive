Sorry Joakim, but who the fuck are you?

You come in for your first post (IIRC) and the best you can do is claim I
have been whining about Pulse Audio issues hence showing you have
completely missed the point of this discussion. I guess you are friends
with Ralf MalSchwarz or maybe you work for the same crew.

Try again when you've actually got a real point to make.

In the mean time like I said in my previous post the answer has been made
clear to my questions and I will be sure not to bother anyone anymore with
my obviously unnecessary posts on the topic of JACK on mobile OS's that
already run PA by default.
