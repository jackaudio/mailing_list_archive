If you're working on it, then what are you doing here? You're not "working
on it" in the sense that I would ever mean "working on it" - you are asking
other people to work on it. If you were "working on it", there would
designs, or lists of specifications, or code or something. Instead, there
is just an email thread in which you repeatedly try to tell the recipients
that they are ignorant, or blinkered or narrow minded because their ideas
about what they want to work on or what they have time to work on isn't
what you want it to be.

Frankly, I'm almost inclined to forward your entire thread here to the
Linux Foundation and others so they can see what kind of sterling work
you're doing to raise support for this effort. Thankfully , however much of
an asshole I am, I'm not that much of an asshole.
