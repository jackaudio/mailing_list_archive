As I've read this thread, I've felt like a salesman was attempting to
convince me to do something seemingly altruistic in order to benefit
himself in some fashion.  I tried to push that thought out of my head

You're a manipulative ass.  I will *never* consider helping you.  I urge
other JACK developers to do the same.
