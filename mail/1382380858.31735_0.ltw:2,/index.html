&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; JACK on mobile - mobile must not necessarily be a phone. It could be any
&gt; &gt; small &amp; mobile (embedded?) device. The thing with the phone is just that
&gt; &gt; many have it at hand.
&gt; &gt; One of the use-cases where JACK could make sense on mobile devices is to
&gt; &gt; have a way to monitor audio anywhere in the graph remotely with low
&gt; &gt; latency. That would include a nicely working netjack or similar setup.
&gt; &gt; JACK just on the phone without any outside connections is not so
&gt; &gt; interesting IMHO.
&gt; &gt; The mobile is also a handy controller for anything on the 'big' machines,
&gt; &gt; but for that, no JACK is used.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, so the consensus appears to be that JACK developers have no interest
&gt; in seeing JACK actually run on mobile OS's (phone/tablet/etc...) and that
&gt; it is considered a waste of time to put any effort into making it
&gt; possible?
&gt; 
&gt; Is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; Should I go back to the people who have opened the door to JACK as a
&gt; default component of the Mobile Audio Stack (excluding Android and iOS)
&gt; and tell them that?
&gt; 
&gt; Should I tell the people at the Linux Foundation that even if they are
&gt; interested in supporting the development process that none of the JACK
&gt; Developers are interested in taking part?
&gt; 
&gt; Are we therefore expecting users who want to run JACK apps or developers
&gt; who want to develop JACK apps to only run desktop systems or Linux
&gt; embedded systems on devices like the Raspberry PI and that developers
&gt; should simply ignore the absolutely massive global mobile market place?
&gt; 
&gt; In other words if someone wants to run JACK on a mobile device they are on
&gt; there own and will not garner any interest from JACK Developers?
&gt; 
&gt; The over all consensus is that JACK is not useful or even needed on mobile
&gt; devices. For example if I were to get it running on my Quad core ARM
&gt; tablet with 2GB of onboard RAM, built in SD and onboard sound device it
&gt; would be a futile and pointless waste of time because those kind of
&gt; resources have no value in a JACK'd system? Or that running JACK on a
&gt; brand new Intel Haswell  (16nm die) tablet made by Samsung running Tizen
&gt; (sponsored by the Linux Foundation) is going to be a waste of time
&gt; because, because, because... um , well because someones girlfriend might
&gt; call them while they are performing and obviously we wouldn't think of
&gt; making it possible for this performer to disable calls while they are
&gt; using their high powered Ubuntu Phone as a realtime FX box or god forbid
&gt; they have a tablet that doesn't even have GSM capabilities in the first
&gt; place and can't be used as a cellphone?
&gt; 
&gt; Is that the correct assessment of interest from JACK developers in getting
&gt; JACK to run on Mobile platforms that already support PA by default?
&gt; 
&gt; I smell a big whiff os BS in the air. Either that or JACK developers are
&gt; complete idiots and have no idea what they are doing. I was under the
&gt; impression that it was not the latter but maybe I am actually wrong about
&gt; that.

Aw Jeez, c'mon guys.

Sorry Patrick if my light-hearted comment may be perceived as a slight
 or dismissal which detracts from the seriousness of the situation.
You're just trying to get things done to move forward.

It's a worthy goal. If anyone can help, if anything can be done here,
 I hope some effort can be put into this.

Tim.
