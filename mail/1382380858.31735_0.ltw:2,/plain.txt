Aw Jeez, c'mon guys.

Sorry Patrick if my light-hearted comment may be perceived as a slight
 or dismissal which detracts from the seriousness of the situation.
You're just trying to get things done to move forward.

It's a worthy goal. If anyone can help, if anything can be done here,
 I hope some effort can be put into this.

Tim.
