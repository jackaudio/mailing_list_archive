Hi Bradley!

Its OK, I did receive your reply. AFAIK the jack-devel list is configured
so that you don't receive your own posts. To save your time I thought it
best to copy the list into my reply as I have a few questions that I think
the list would be interested in too.

What is it you are wanting JACK for Android for? I should imagine console
apps (like ecasound and nama) should be portable with any modification to
the source? Will this be the case?

Qt5 supports Android but how well and how realistic would an Android
qtractor port be? Rui says qtr is Qt5 ready so that should help.

Are you writing a qjack/patchage equivalent for Android too?

Thanks Bradley!

Dan

&gt; I never received my reply to you through the JACK list, don't know what
&gt; happened. So I am also responding to you personally.
&gt;
&gt; JACK on Android requires a special distro. This is primarily to permit
&gt; real-time priorities and memory locking.
&gt;
&gt; Clients, however, are distributed as APKs.

&gt;&gt; V. interesting news Bradley - it seems to have totally gone over Pat's
&gt;&gt; head, unless he replied to you privately.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It sounds like your Android JACK port isn't functional yet but is someway
&gt;&gt; towards working. Will we need to flash a custom JACK distro to use your
&gt;&gt; port or will it eventually be available as a regular apk for anyone to
&gt;&gt; install?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Christian:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; JACK iOS is dead already? Why? There is no mention or explanation of its
&gt;&gt; passing on its homepage that I can see.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Very interesting comments on pro audio and mobile platforms, lots here
&gt;&gt;&gt; to investigate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been looking at Android as a platform for pro audio applications.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am also convinced that true low latency audio on mainstream Android is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not an achievable goal. Google priorities, e.g. maintaining call quality
&gt;&gt;&gt; and  low power consumption, render it so. What is achievable is the more
&gt;&gt;&gt; modest goal of an Android distribution specifically instrumented for pro
&gt;&gt;&gt; audio applications. This is still a worthy goal, especially if you consider
&gt;&gt;&gt; Android as an embedded system that can run on a low cost dedicated device.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a functional prototype of a pro audio Android distribution
&gt;&gt;&gt; running on the Nexus 7. At the end of round 1 of the latency wars I am
&gt;&gt;&gt; reliably running Simple Client using USB audio at 96k with buffers set at
&gt;&gt;&gt; 512 X 2. To accomplish this, JACK and its clients run in native space
&gt;&gt;&gt; directly on top of ALSA with client user interfaces running as standard
&gt;&gt;&gt; Java Android activities. I am currently finishing up work on client
&gt;&gt;&gt; installation and configuration; I hope to return to the latency issue soon.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are approaches I have yet to explore, such as application of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; real-time patches.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This work highlights the critical difference between Android and iOS:
&gt;&gt;&gt; with iOS you are restricted to what Apple decides to provide in terms of
&gt;&gt;&gt; hardware and system software. With Android, if there is a problem that
&gt;&gt;&gt; needs corrected, such as audio drivers, you have the ability to do so.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I do have a question regarding iOS and audio latency. Does anyone on
&gt;&gt;&gt; this list have reliable metrics? I have seen some low figures reported on
&gt;&gt;&gt; Internet postings. However, figures I have encountered from individuals who
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually measured it seem out of range for pro audio.
