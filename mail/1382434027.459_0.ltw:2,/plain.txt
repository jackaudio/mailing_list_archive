Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK on mobile

Hi Bradley!

Its OK, I did receive your reply. AFAIK the jack-devel list is configured
so that you don't receive your own posts. To save your time I thought it
best to copy the list into my reply as I have a few questions that I think
the list would be interested in too.

What is it you are wanting JACK for Android for? I should imagine console
apps (like ecasound and nama) should be portable with any modification to
the source? Will this be the case?

Qt5 supports Android but how well and how realistic would an Android
qtractor port be? Rui says qtr is Qt5 ready so that should help.

Are you writing a qjack/patchage equivalent for Android too?

Thanks Bradley!

Dan
