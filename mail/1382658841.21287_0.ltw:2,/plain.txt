I took a look at some of the changes you made.  I noticed that you're
compiling in the old ALSA seq and raw MIDI interfaces, and not using
the 'alsarawmidi' driver.  The old ALSA seq and raw interfaces have
known timing issues that aren't acceptable in a pro audio context.  I
suggest you switch to using the 'alsarawmidi' driver.

Congratulations on the release!
