Hi Devin,

Thanks for feedback.
In my short investigation, there were not found ALSA seq  and raw MIDI
driver on the target because I think kernel options disabled it on mobile
segment.
I think it seems faced many hardware dependant things on ALSA SoC layer.
That is why 'alsarawmidi' driver couldn't compiled.
Is my understanding and guess right?

Thanks,
KimJeongYeon
