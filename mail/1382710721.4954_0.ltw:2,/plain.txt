Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [jack1] building without zita

(1) the current configure.ac is missing checks for the zita headers (it
just checks for the libs). so if you have the libs but not the headers
installed, it will fail. i will try to fix this ASAP

(2) yes, there will be a circular dependency so if you are building them
both from scratch the order would be jack1 => zita => rebuild jack1
