given that netjack1 and alsa_in were written by the same person, you might
want to consider that fact for a few minutes.

&gt; Yes, indeed, I have got it running, but in fact i'm not fully
&gt; satisfied with achieved latency.
&gt; In fact I thinkthere may be a need for a dedicated solution, due to
&gt; following requirements:
&gt;
&gt; 1. It is supposed to be a wireless guitar system, so the embedded system
&gt; must
&gt;    be connected via WiFi.
&gt;  2. UDP over WiFi will almost for sure result in lost packets (due to
&gt; collisions),
&gt;     so I need a protocol with acknowledge (RUDP, UDP-RT or simply TCP/IP?)
&gt; 3. At the transmitter side there is no need for buffering at all. I
&gt; should simply
&gt;     transmit all samples received from the ALSA driver as quickly as they
&gt; come.
&gt;     The buffering and synchronization should be done only on a receiver
&gt; side.
&gt;
&gt; So I think, that the best way to go will be to modify the existing
&gt; alsa_in program so that it receives samples via network...

&gt; &gt; hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; you're close to having it work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The config on your workstation looks ok, the problem is on the embedded
&gt; side.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On the embedded system, you have to start jack with the "net" backend,
&gt; not the alsa one.
&gt; &gt; jackd -R -d net  (more option available)
&gt; &gt; Doing this, the embedded system will look for a master jack which is
&gt; started on the workstation, and create the ports for audio communication.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then to have the signal of your guitar go through the network link, you
&gt; have to use jack_load audioadapter on the embedded system to gain access to
&gt; the soundcard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A lot more information on this page, will help you understand better
&gt; this configuration :
&gt; &gt; http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have tried a similar setup, and it's working great ! Good luck

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm preparing a jack based wireless guitar system.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The previous solution was based on microcontroller,
&gt; &gt;&gt; dedicated radio link and receiver imitating USB audio card
&gt; &gt;&gt; ( http://www.ise.pw.edu.pl/~wzab/wireless_guitar_system/ ).
&gt; &gt;&gt; In this solution I used "alsa_in" to synchronize the input stream
&gt; &gt;&gt; with the soundcard in the receiving audio workstation.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Upgrading my system I have decided to replace the microcontroller
&gt; &gt;&gt; based transmitter with dedicated radion link with an embedded system
&gt; &gt;&gt; equipped with the WiFi card, and use standard WiFi card as the
&gt; &gt;&gt; receiver in the audio workstation.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have successfully implemented the driver for CS5343/4 ADC for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; ALSA SoC and packaged the jack2 for Buildroot.
&gt; &gt;&gt; (
&gt; https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.sys.raspberry-pi/EgQAQ0DNwN4,
&gt; &gt;&gt;  http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2013-October/081087.html),
&gt; &gt;&gt; so now I only need to integrate jack in the embedded system with jack
&gt; in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; workstation.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; And here I run into real problems.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd like to have the audio workstation initialized in such a way, that
&gt; &gt;&gt; jack is running, audio processing programs are also running and
&gt; connected
&gt; &gt;&gt; to jack, and the system waits for connection of the embedded system
&gt; &gt;&gt; as an audio source.
&gt; &gt;&gt; So I have started jack with qjackctl on my workstation. Then I should to
&gt; &gt;&gt; create the audio input ports associated with the network server waiting
&gt; &gt;&gt; for data stream coming from my embedded system. However I couldn't find
&gt; &gt;&gt; any way to do it :-(.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I've tried "jack_load netmanager", but it didn't create any ports.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Adding the "-c" option didn't help
&gt; &gt;&gt; (load netmanager -i "-c").
&gt; &gt;&gt; So I've tried to run "jack netadapter", and it created additional
&gt; &gt;&gt; capture ports.
&gt; &gt;&gt; But now it is unclear for me, how to connect to it from my embedded
&gt; system,
&gt; &gt;&gt; because it seems, that now my audio workstation should be the slave...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; When I start jack in my embedded system:
&gt; &gt;&gt; jackd -P41 -p512 -t10000 -dalsa -r48000 -p256 -n2 -Xseq  -Chw:0,0
&gt; &gt;&gt; jack_load netmanager -i "-c"
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Nothing happens in the workstation. In the jack message window I can
&gt; still see:
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ringbuffer automatic adaptative mode size = 1024 frames
&gt; &gt;&gt; NetAdapter started in sync mode without Master's transport sync.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Waiting for a master...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't know, is it possible to setup such a system with workstation
&gt; &gt;&gt; waiting for connection of the embedded system?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Should I use another protocol - e.g. netone?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Should I write my own application imitating "alsa_in" but using
&gt; &gt;&gt; the network connection?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll appreciate any suggestions, explanantions or hints.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; TIA &amp; Regards,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Wojtek
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; "jack_load netmanager" on it.
