Congratulations for the release!

I read also your code and have somme comments:

- you seems to use a lot of #if (JACK_ANDROID) at several places in the*generic* part of the code. This could be probably cleanup a bit and better moved in android specific files.

-  your JackGoldfishDriver class is defined as a subclass of JackTimedDriver. I don't this this is necessary since your driver is simply a "blocking" one (that is using booking read/write specific API calls right). Then having JackGoldfishDriver be a subclass of JackAudioDriver should be enough

- what are your plan concerning reintegration of the android specific code in the official jack2 tree? This would be great of course, I can help cleanup up the code a bit to facilitate this, if you need to.

Stéphane
