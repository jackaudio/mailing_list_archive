Subject:     [Jack-Devel] adding gtkiostream to jackaudio.org/applications

Hi there,

I am not sure who maintains the web pages, however could gtkiostream be 
added to the "Programming Libraries" section please ?

Here is the software web page :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkiostream/

Here is a blurb :
GTKIOStream has a JackClient C++ class which trivialises Jack client 
connections, to use simply include  the JackClient.H header file and 
inherit the JackClient class. GTKIOStream has many other tools for DSP, 
Audio Masking, FFTs, plotting data, building GUIs using GTK and various 
other features.

Here is the gtkiostream API :
http://www.flatmax.org/gtkiostream/html/

Here is the JackClient API :
http://www.flatmax.org/gtkiostream/html/classJackClient.html

thanks
Matt
