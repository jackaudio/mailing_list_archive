Dear Stephane,

Many thanks for reply!  I deeply appreciate your review and feedback :-)

Of course, I always hope to re-integrate android specific code to official
jack2 branch in the near future for accelerate investigation on android
platform.

I definitely need your help to cleanup the code which following jack2
branch policy.
Also, I would be start work immediately after my figuring out your
intention of code cleanup(or any example).

Please let me know if I am misunderstanding your mail.

Regards,
KimJeongYeon
