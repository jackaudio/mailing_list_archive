Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] multiple jack crashes in high-load VOIP environment

First: what precise version of jackd are you using?

At the same time, ffmpeg is being started, creating an input jack port and sending all audio out to the wowza flash server using the rtmp protocol. Now both ports (asterisk/out and ffmpeg/in) are being connected using jack_connect. During this session, mplayer playes wav-files to tho asterisk/in port.

Our current -not very intelligent- solution ist to call jack_lsp in intervals to find out, when the port is available.

That problems became recognizable when we did our last tests after finishing the development. (okay, we THOUGHT we finished the development work ;)
