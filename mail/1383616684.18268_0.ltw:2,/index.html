Uwe,

You asked "what's wrong with the jack plugin for alsa" and while I was
trying to remember why I didn't like that, maybe Paul answered that. I
honestly cannot recall why I didn't like that solution.

The fact that you just tried to find an updated version of libflashsupport
the other day maybe is a clue - I honestly can't recall why I didn't like
that solution (maybe just too much messing around? Maybe I had
errors/problems? Can't recall)

Try it out though, and let me know how it works for you.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But what's wrong with the jack plugin for alsa?  When I configured it,
&gt;&gt; it worked right out of the box. No extra install (besides alsa-plugins
&gt;&gt; of course) needed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; that depends a LOT on the version and the use case(s). torben did some
&gt; work on the jack plugin for ALSA - it used to have some fairly egregious
&gt; errors. It would just work "most of the time" and then fail horribly.
