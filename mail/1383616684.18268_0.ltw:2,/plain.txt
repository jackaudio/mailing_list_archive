Uwe,

You asked "what's wrong with the jack plugin for alsa" and while I was
trying to remember why I didn't like that, maybe Paul answered that. I
honestly cannot recall why I didn't like that solution.

The fact that you just tried to find an updated version of libflashsupport
the other day maybe is a clue - I honestly can't recall why I didn't like
that solution (maybe just too much messing around? Maybe I had
errors/problems? Can't recall)

Try it out though, and let me know how it works for you.
