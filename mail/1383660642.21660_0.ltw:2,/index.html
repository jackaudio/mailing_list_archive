&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyone here to comment on Jacktrip performance and reliability on internet, especially running on OSX?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; (https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/soundwire/software/jacktrip/  and http://code.google.com/p/jacktrip/)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We at www.sarc.qub.ac.uk, along with a host of other universities have been using JackTrip for a number of years now as our default udp audio transfer software tool with respect to Network Music Performance Research. 
&gt; 
&gt; I can safely vouch that it has been extremely reliable and robust. 
&gt; 
&gt; We have been involved in a many number of multi-site performances which have utilised the system on both OSX and Linux and have never ran into software issues concerned directly with JackTrip. 
&gt; 
&gt; There have been instances where we have run three sites or more - implementing a 15 plus discrete channel system at 44.1, 16bit. 
&gt; 
&gt; We have however run into issues of compatibility with respect to JackPilot/QJackCntrl and iterations of Mac OSX. These issues are slowly being ironed out, though they seem to be lagging behind the pace of OSX development. 
&gt; 
&gt; The most stable system i have personally used is OSX 10.6.8 coupled with the latest JackTrip build, along with the latest JackPilot Iteration (not the 10.7/10.8 Beta)
&gt; 
&gt; If you have any other questions regarding this, i can be reached at
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Robin

Thanks for you help.

We tried here between 2 machines, both are behind a NAT (so have a 192.168.XXX.XXX kind of address). One of them was configured to redirect the 4464 port on the real 192.168.XXX.XXX  address and was started as the server. On client I did :

./jacktrip -c 82.67.55.75   got a connection but then jacktrip crashed with the following log:



We will try again this evening by redirecting the 4464 port on both sides.
