Thanks for you help.

We tried here between 2 machines, both are behind a NAT (so have a 192.168.XXX.XXX kind of address). One of them was configured to redirect the 4464 port on the real 192.168.XXX.XXX  address and was started as the server. On client I did :

./jacktrip -c 82.67.55.75   got a connection but then jacktrip crashed with the following log:



We will try again this evening by redirecting the 4464 port on both sides.
