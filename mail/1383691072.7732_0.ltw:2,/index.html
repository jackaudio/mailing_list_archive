&gt; You asked "what's wrong with the jack plugin for alsa" and while I was

&gt; honestly cannot recall why I didn't like that solution.

I'm very interested in the reasons -- if you some time can recall them.

&gt; The fact that you just tried to find an updated version of
&gt; libflashsupport the other day maybe is a clue

No, it is not.  I have been looking for a solution to play with "normal"
(means most of the time alsa) audio applications while jack is running
and have found three variants:

 * libflashsupport-jack
 * jack-plugin for alsa
 * alsa loopback device

As I am on archlinux I first tried to find existing solutions. But
libflashsupport-jack seemed to be outdated (and now I know, it is) and
for loopback I have to build my own kernel (modules).

So I opted for the jack-plugin and found it working most of the time (or
better all times minus one).  The one exception is native web audio in
firefox 25 (chromium and opera are just fine -- BTW opera seems to have
native jack support!).  If I remember correctly, FF 24 has worked, too.
 And flash audio still works if native audio presents silence -- how
embarrassing!

&gt; - I honestly can't recall
&gt; why I didn't like that solution (maybe just too much messing around?
&gt; Maybe I had errors/problems? Can't recall)

I have found some sources that say so, but no real evidence.  And for me
the jack-plugin is best suited, cause it provides support for all kinds
of audio applications not just flash.  Even for simple commandline
applications like mpg123 or ogg123 (and since the only solution for
playing mp3 or ogg files from the commandline with jack is mplayer, this
is a very welcomed feature).

So if you do have any objections against jack-plugin, I am highly
interested.

&gt; Try it out though, and let me know how it works for you.

Will try it and if at all possible initiate an up-to-date arch package.

Cheers
Uwe
