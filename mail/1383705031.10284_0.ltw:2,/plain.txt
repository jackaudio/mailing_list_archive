mpg123 -o jack foo.mp3
(but yes, ogg123 has no jack backend)

I'm another arch user that has been using alsa loopback with the stock
kernel, although alsa_in is a bit cpu hungry on my laptop (uses a
constant 10%) and requires some micromanagement because it starts
using 100% cpu after I suspend/resume. So I ended up setting up
libflashsupport, which is still working fine for me (though it's been
awhile since my last system upgrade).
