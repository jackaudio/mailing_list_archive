Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [jack1] building without zita

I would still like to be able to compile it without the libzita stuff
for now. Apart from this (Debian) system I want to compile it for
another ARM system which has no real package manager or libzita
packages. It's a buildroot compile and I am not sure how I would get
over the circular dependency there. But if you say it isn't possible
do you know off hand around when this was introduced?

I am trying to track down and report some alignment traps encountered
on one ARM system but not the other...
