Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] multiple jack crashes in high-load VOIP environment

Okay, we compiled the git version now. While compiling we got this message:

   "Build with a maximum of 64 JACK clients"
   "Build with a maximum of 768 ports per application"

In our environment we need 5 clients per asterisk sip phone call:

   1. asterisk
   2. ffmpeg
   3. mplayer (background)
   4. mplayer (clip)
   5. mplayer (clip, mixing)

Basing on that restrictions there are only 64/5 ~ 12 simultanously phone 
calls possible. May be this technical restriction causes our problem? We 
changed from our old environment to this new one because the old 
technology only offered 10 simultanously calls per (Windows) server and 
we need about 150 simultanously calls. Updating from 10 to 12..... 
hmmmm. ;)  What is the reason for this limitation? We did not found any 
information about this before. And no compiler option to adjust this 
settings.

Best regards
Marc
