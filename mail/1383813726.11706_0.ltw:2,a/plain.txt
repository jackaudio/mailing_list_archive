Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] multiple jack crashes in high-load VOIP environment

Hi Marc!


Did you not consider/evaluate using Mumble instead of SIP/Asterisk? If you
don't require video support from your VOIP stack, Mumble is the best FLOSS
solution in my experience. Setting up a Mumble server is as easy as
installing a package and forwarding the correct port to it - done! Well,
there's lots more you may want to configure but basically thats it.

Mumble doesn't officially support JACK yet although falkTX has patched it
for that purpose, should you require it. I have created this short guide to
compiling and installing the latest Mumble release + JACK support, although
you may be able to get away without it?
