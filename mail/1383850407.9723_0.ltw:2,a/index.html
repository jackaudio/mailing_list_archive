No there was definitely an issue with 0.121.3.  With 0.121.3 (from
Debian's repos) I get:

[  496.470422] Alignment trap: not handling instruction edc67a06 at [&lt;b6f10af4&gt;]
[  496.478012] Unhandled fault: alignment exception (0x801) at 0xb65251e6
Bus error

This was fixed in a version I compiled a while back (but then deleted
again) that called itself 0.123.0 but I am not sure what git commit
fixed it.

Anyway, I'll do a more complete report when I manage to compile some
more recent versions again. You are right, it should be fairly easy to
figure out with the log.

As an aside do you think any work could be done to optimize Jack for
NEON SIMD? Or  would there not be much point since it doesn't actually
modify audio data itself?

&gt;&gt; Yeah well, alright. I started trying to find a good revision two weeks
&gt;&gt; ago but gave up hoping I could just use the latest.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; By most recent tarball you mean 0.121.3? That has alignment traps on
&gt;&gt; both systems unfortunately. I am trying to test with the latest
&gt;&gt; versions anyway so it's more useful.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; it is unlikely that any has really changed that would affect this issue
&gt; since 0.121.3 ... git log really will show you precisely the zita code
&gt; showed up.
