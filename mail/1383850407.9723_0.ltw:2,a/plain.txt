Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [jack1] building without zita

No there was definitely an issue with 0.121.3.  With 0.121.3 (from
Debian's repos) I get:

[  496.470422] Alignment trap: not handling instruction edc67a06 at [<b6f10af4>]
[  496.478012] Unhandled fault: alignment exception (0x801) at 0xb65251e6
Bus error

This was fixed in a version I compiled a while back (but then deleted
again) that called itself 0.123.0 but I am not sure what git commit
fixed it.

Anyway, I'll do a more complete report when I manage to compile some
more recent versions again. You are right, it should be fairly easy to
figure out with the log.

As an aside do you think any work could be done to optimize Jack for
NEON SIMD? Or  would there not be much point since it doesn't actually
modify audio data itself?
