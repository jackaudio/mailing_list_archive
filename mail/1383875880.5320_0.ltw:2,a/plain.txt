Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] multiple jack crashes in high-load VOIP environment

Hello!

We were not able today to let a live test run under high load but in a 
test (under minimum load) we got some error messages in relationship to 
xruns from Jack. I don't know if the reason for that technical issues is 
the same as for that other problems under high load or if this is 
undepending from it. However, I post them here:

   2013-11-08 01:40:43 13 [watchdog.sh] output-jackd: JackEngine::XRun: 
client = AX_KQu2 was not finished, state = Running
   2013-11-08 01:40:43 13 [watchdog.sh] output-jackd: 
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
2013-11-08 01:40:43 13 [watchdog.sh] output-jackd: JackEngine::XRun: 
client = AX_KQu2 was not finished, state = Triggered
2013-11-08 01:40:43 13 [watchdog.sh] output-jackd: 
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
2013-11-08 01:40:43 21 [dial.sh] output/ffmpeg: [jack @ 0x3599120] JACK 
xrun

This messages occure BEFORE the Jack ports (asterisk/ffmpeg) are 
connected. And to that timepoint no audio is streamed.

Any ideas?

Best regards
Marc
