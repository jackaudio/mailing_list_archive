Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [jack2] Crashing after LockedTimedWait error

Hi,

so as you might have gathered from my previous messages: I am trying to run
jackd on some embedded systems with ARM processors. My current test system
is a single-core Freescale i.MX535 at 1.2Ghz

I am having some trouble getting heavier Jack clients to run. I have been
doing some testing with this little test amplifier but it runs its process
1000 times per process callback:
https://github.com/kasbah/juci/blob/master/Source/Main.cpp

So, I get a lot of this:

JackPosixProcessSync::LockedTimedWait error usec = 5000000 err = Connection
timed out
Driver is not running
Cannot create new client
Cannot open JuceJackDummy client
jack_client_open() failed, status = 0x21

And after that jack is pretty much frozen an unusable even for jack_lsp and
jack_simple_client.

Now my question is: can I get these bad clients to not freeze Jack or is
this pretty much expected behavior?

Cheers,

Kaspar
