Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [jack1] building without zita

So I tried building git-4a7a2f3 but I keep getting warnings that
Makefile.am's timestamp is in the future and the configure keeps going
around in loops?

I actually managed to cross-compile latest master fine within buildroot for
the the other ARM target (without Zita) so I am not sure what is going on
here.
