quite a bit of confusion here, it seems. JACK will not general work
correctly when sharing a device. If it is sharing a device, then it is
ALSA's job to generate the timingm, and it will use one of several possible
timer sources.

In general if JACK is using a particular PCM device, it is the *only* user
of that device, and ALSA is doing what JACK tells it to do.
