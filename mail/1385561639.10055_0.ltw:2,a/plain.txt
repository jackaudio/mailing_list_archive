Yes, I would definitely agree on that. API usage examples should be public 
domain or max. under a less restrictive (i.e. BSD like) license. Releasing 
them under GPL terms is contra productive IMO.

Besides, some of the examples are that simple, that they most probably won't 
even be seen as defendable intellectual property in many countries.
