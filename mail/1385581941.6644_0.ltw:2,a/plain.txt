Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack-transport sync-capabilities over network

Hello there!

I want to use jack-transport to sync some apps over network. Maybe I did
something wrong, because the slave lags about 2 seconds behind... Or is
jack-transport not made for this job?

My setup:

I'm running jackd (with qjackctl) on the master with these parameters:

/usr/bin/jackd -P89 -p512 -u -dalsa -dhw:DSP -r48000 -p64 -n2 -s

runs smooth without xruns on a 4-core Xeon-machine. After that a script
is run to establish the net- (and some MIDI-)stuff:

#!/bin/bash
jack_netsource -i3 -o2 -I1 -O1 -n8 -H laptop &
a2j &
exit 0

...with "laptop" being my slave-machine, a Thinkpad T410. This one
I'm launching with:

/usr/bin/jackd -P70 -p128 -t1000 -u -dnet -i2 -o3

Nevermind the audio-connections. It's a leftover from another project I'm
using. Shouldn't be a problem for jack-transport, right?

The 2 computers are connected over GBit-ethernet. Got some net-xruns
from time to time, but nothing permanent.

As I already said above: When I start jack-transport on master, the
slave lags about 2 seconds behind. 
When I stop jack-transport on master, the slave is immediately
synced to the masters time. No lag - but just when jack-transport is
stopped.
  
Have I missed something?

Greets!
Mitsch
