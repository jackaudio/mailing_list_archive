&gt; Hi Jeremy,

&gt; Yes mad sampling rate -r4441000 is a typo ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Good hint with the jack_bufsize! Distortions temporarly disappear when 
&gt; increasing the buffer size and setting it back to 128 (jack_bufsize 256 &amp; 
&gt; jack_bufsize 128)
&gt; Altough, distortions start again after some time.

Hello Fabian,

Then something is having a hard time catching up because this looks like
that xruns appear after a while.

&gt; Here are some more details about the system:
&gt; Linux Kernel: 3.8.4-rt2 #4 SMP PREEMPT RT Tue Nov 12 11:59:47 CET 2013 
&gt; armv7l GNU/Linux 
&gt; CPU governors is performance.
&gt; 

3.8 might have USB related issues. That's one of the reasons I stick
with 3.4. Not sure if the USB issues are related to your specific issue
though.

&gt; Results from https://github.com/raboof/realtimeconfigquickscan all good 
&gt; except:
&gt; 
&gt; Checking access to the high precision event timer... not found - not good
&gt; /dev/hpet not found.
&gt; Checking access to the real-time clock... not found - not good
&gt; /dev/rtc not found.
&gt; Checking if kernel system timer is set to 1000 hz... not found - not good
&gt; Try setting CONFIG_HZ to 1000
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK the timers are only relevant for MIDI, so this should not cause any 
&gt; issues here.
&gt; 

No. In fact, this whole section of the realtimeconfigquickscan script is
a bit outdated. Afaik barely any Linux MIDI applications are using
/dev/rtc or /dev/hpet anymore.

&gt; Content of rtirq.conf:
&gt; 
&gt; RTIRQ_NAME_LIST="rtc snd usb i8042"
&gt; # Highest priority.
&gt; RTIRQ_PRIO_HIGH=99
&gt; # Priority decrease step.
&gt; RTIRQ_PRIO_DECR=2
&gt; # Lowest priority.
&gt; RTIRQ_PRIO_LOW=51
&gt; # Whether to reset all IRQ threads to SCHED_OTHER.
&gt; RTIRQ_RESET_ALL=1
&gt; # On kernel configurations that support it,
&gt; # which services should be NOT threaded
&gt; # (space separated list).
&gt; RTIRQ_NON_THREADED="rtc snd"
&gt; # Process names which will be forced to the
&gt; # highest realtime priority range (99-91)
&gt; # (space separated list, from highest to lower priority).
&gt; # RTIRQ_HIGH_LIST="timer"
&gt; 
&gt; Running the script sets the IRQ thread for ehci_usb RT priority to -96, 
&gt; jackd has -81 and the jack client process -70.
&gt; The client applies a FIR convolution on the signal. Thats simple though, 
&gt; keeping CPU usage at 0.x%.
&gt; After starting jackd, im settings the process priority:
&gt; sudo chrt --fifo -p 80 `pidof jackd`
&gt; Although, I'm not 100% sure if this is actually necessary, and passing the -
&gt; P80 is enough?
&gt; 

Yes, that's enough, afaik it does almost exactly the same thing as the
chrt incantation.

&gt; There's only one single ehci USB bus (which shares the IRQ with an ohci USB 
&gt; OTG bus). No chance to get ethernet and audio on different buses.
&gt;

Maybe you could try unbinding the driver from the OTG controller.

&gt; What kernel version and realtime patch are you running on the Cubieboard?

3.4.61-rt77

&gt; Did you enable full preemption?

Yes.

 And did you do any further optimizations?
&gt;

I've tweaked the Ext4 parameters, disabled all unneeded servers, set
CPU's to performance, slightly overclocked the CPU's. And it's a
headless installation, no X. I should check if I did any other
optimizations. If so I'll report back.

Jeremy

&gt; Thanks &amp; Regards
&gt; Fabian
