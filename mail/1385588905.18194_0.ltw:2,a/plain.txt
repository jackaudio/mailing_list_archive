Hello Fabian,

Then something is having a hard time catching up because this looks like
that xruns appear after a while.

3.8 might have USB related issues. That's one of the reasons I stick
with 3.4. Not sure if the USB issues are related to your specific issue
though.

No. In fact, this whole section of the realtimeconfigquickscan script is
a bit outdated. Afaik barely any Linux MIDI applications are using
/dev/rtc or /dev/hpet anymore.

Yes, that's enough, afaik it does almost exactly the same thing as the
chrt incantation.

Maybe you could try unbinding the driver from the OTG controller.

3.4.61-rt77

Yes.

 And did you do any further optimizations?

I've tweaked the Ext4 parameters, disabled all unneeded servers, set
CPU's to performance, slightly overclocked the CPU's. And it's a
headless installation, no X. I should check if I did any other
optimizations. If so I'll report back.
