Don't know if this relates, but...  On the OMAP4 SoC I've seen similar 
problems with the EHCI controller with respect to audio reliability.  In 
that set-up, the CPU has to respond to very frequent interrupts in order 
for the controller to work properly.  This often lead to XRUNS.

But at this latency, it could be *anything* causing your glitches.  Any 
driver holding a spin lock while doing some "background" task will do 
it.  I recommend tracing with `trace-cmd'[1] and inspecting them with 
`kernelshark'.  If you can get a `trace-cmd' capture that includes the 
XRUN's you'll get some clues about what is happening.

[1] At the very least, do:
     # trace-cmd record -e "sched:*" -e "irq:*"
