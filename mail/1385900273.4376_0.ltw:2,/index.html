Helloo! I'm Elior
I would LOVE to talk to anyone more experienced with JACK, i'm having some
troubles but I know I can use it well for what I want because I actually
did it once ( and then it never worked again ): )

The thing is:
I want to stream (with Open Broadcaster Software) my DAW (FL Studio) and of
course I want it to use ASIO drivers, but OBS does not accept ASIO as
output/input devices (fairly understandable though)
So... I've been looking this and that and finally found a great solution.
JACK.
After reading about how this program work, I opened an (I think) well
configured "Jack PortAudio" and then an (I think) well configured "Jack
Control". Just the default thing, I ONLY followed the instructions about
how to make it work with Windows (the text you have in the main page or
FAQs or something) and BOOM! it worked!

JackRouter in FL Studio, JPortAudio + J Control, and OBS recording my Line
1/2 (M-AUDIO Fast Track Pro) output. This is, using FL Studio with low
latency ASIO drivers and recording with OBS, just what I wanted.

Then, next time I tried to do it, without tweaking anything, it didn't
work, and never ever would it.
The problem now is that I use JR+JPA+JC and it actually works well, and I
can hear my FL Studio on my Line 1/2 output, BUT! OBS seems to not take
anything from my "routing" from FL Studio to Line 1/2 output, it just stays
as if nothing is going to that output, unless I open any music file/play
any sound in Windows, it recognizes the signal of THAT Line 1/2, but not
what I'm hearing on it (FL Studio)


So sorry for that long text, hope my english is not a punishment and thank
you so so much for reading!
