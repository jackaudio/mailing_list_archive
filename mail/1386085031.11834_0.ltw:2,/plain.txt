No.  PCM devices with multiple substreams typically use them for
hardware mixing.  (When opening a device without an explicitly
specified substream number, ALSA chooses the first free substream.)

The driver should have used two devices instead of two substreams.
(But automatically opening multiple devices would not necessarily be
a good idea either.)

Only for this particular device.


A useful feature would be the ability to specify multiple device names,
and Jack automatically constructing a "multi" device for them.
