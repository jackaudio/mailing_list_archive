I faced a similar dilemma when I first ported the existing RME hammerfall
driver to ALSA (way back in 1999). The windows driver had the option of
being accessed as a series of stereo pairs, and that was my first design
model. It turned out to have a lot of overhead and wasn't very useful. It
also didn't fit into the basic ALSA model of hw:* representing raw hardware
capabilities.

The problem here is that the level of independence of these streams is
fuzzy. Start/stop is independent, but sample rate is not. I would make a
guess that the period size may also not be independent. I don't think that
ALSA provides a clear rationale for one or the other here, but Gabriel's
suggestion seems smart to me.
