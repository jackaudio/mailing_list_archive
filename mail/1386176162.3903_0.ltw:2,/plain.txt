Wasn't there a problem a few months ago where two devices which were
synchronized externally and made into a compound device using asoundrc
occassionally were flagged as having an xrun because the first card
interrupted that it had finished the buffer, but the second card was still
finishing up the last few samples because there was no way to enforce the
start command to be on the same clock edge?

Seems that the same thing could potentially apply to this device.
