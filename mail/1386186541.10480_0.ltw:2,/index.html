&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I am one of the founder of KissBox company, and I am promoting RTP-MIDI a
&gt; lot, since this is an open and free protocol (and also because we use it
&gt; our products). I wrote the complete RTP-MIDI stack for our products, and we
&gt; are getting more and more requests from people about a possible support
&gt; under Linux.
&gt; Right now, RTP-MIDI is supported under Mac OS (it's part of Mac OS since
&gt; version 10.4) and under Windows (there is a free driver named rtpMIDI), but
&gt; not yet under Linux.
&gt;
&gt; I looked first at the possibility to write a kernel driver to add MIDI
&gt; ports to Linux (since RTP-MIDI is just transporting MIDI over Ethernet),
&gt; but writing such a driver is clearly a too complex thing for me (I am a
&gt; programmer, but I have to run KissBox in parallel, since we are only two in
&gt; the company)
&gt;
&gt; I know Jack since a long time and I wrote some small applications using it
&gt; (mainly for testing), and I thought first about an external application
&gt; creating RTP-MIDI entry points and then talking to Jack, but finally, I
&gt; think that it would be very interesting to include the RTP-MIDI support
&gt; directly in Jack.
&gt;
&gt; So my question is mainly: would you be interested if I join the project in
&gt; order to add RTP-MIDI support in Jack for the Linux platform? I will of
&gt; course open my source code and offer it to the community (it's not the
&gt; source code being used on the KissBox however, since we are using a
&gt; microcontroller on which Linux can not run)
&gt;

Benoit ,

somehow I missed this message (not sure how). We would certainly be happy
to see support for RTP MIDI on Linux, but I don't think that JACK is the
right place for it. It belongs in a standalone library or as an ALSA
component.

Paul Davis


ps. next time consider sending messages to jack-devel rather than
