Yes, that was the problem I had partially remembered.  Wouldn't the same
concern apply here?  The equivalent of pcm_multi would have to be used for
this device if it is two independent streams that share a clock but can be
started and stopped independently.

&gt;&gt; Seems that the same thing could potentially apply to this device.
