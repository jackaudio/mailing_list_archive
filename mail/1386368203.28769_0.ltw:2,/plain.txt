Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Having problems after installing JACK and need help!

Hi,

I installed JACK and the audio settings of my studio system got messed up.
I've tried looking for info and haven't found anything on how to get my
system back to normal. I'm using win7/64 intel i7 3.20ghz, RME Hammerfall
DSP 9652 and Cubase. I'm getting audio from cubase but no audio from
internet or itunes, I have the right outputs assigned for application audio
but it's not working.

I'm sorry if this address isn't meant for tech issues, I realize I got
myself into this pickle, if someone could at least point me in the right
direction I would be so greatful. I'm really stuck and I need to work.
