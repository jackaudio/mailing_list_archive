Thanks for your reply!

Finally I had the time to check several things. Unfortunately, no
combination behaved like expected. I tried:

jackd2 on master / jackd1 on slave: Slave lags 2 seconds
jackd2 on master / jackd2 on slave: No connection possible over network
jackd1 on master / jackd1 on slave: Slave lags 2 seconds

Is this a known behavior? Bug or feature? Misconfiguration?

I know it's not particularly a developer issue, but, you know, when
asking about special abilities of jackd on the lists I'm using I only
get a bunch of shrug and rumors - it seems, you can only get precise
answers from the people that programmed that stuff. Sorry for that!

If there's anyone interested in why I'm after this feature: I'm trying
to sync 2 xjadeo-video-streams (on slave with 2 beamers) with 1 audio
stream (on master with ecasound). With jack, it seemed theoretically
easy... :)

Greets!
