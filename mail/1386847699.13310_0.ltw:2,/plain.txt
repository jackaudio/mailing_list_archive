This will change with the next generation of processors. Today, it is 2
or 4 identical cores into a mobile, but tomorrow, it will be one low
frequency low power core for the standby, one core optimized to control
the phone, a third one for the GUI and other non critical tasks, and a
forth for rt critical application like audio. The applications must
be compiled to be able to load on the core that is most suited
for them. Otherwise, they will fallback on some kind of virtual JAVA
or .NET machine.

When these processors will be on the market, this will imply some huge
changes for the software, inclusive the possibility to get rt audio out
of the box even on low cost non dedicated devices.
