Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Automagically connecting audio HW

Quick question: Has anyone ever done anything to enable new devices to
JACK? (ie: plugging guitar amp via USB, USB headset, recording devices, etc)

I can (and have) done UDEV rules and have them spawn things - thought it
might be neato to have something listen for JACKable devices and add them
to the circuit.

Haven't thought this through at all - just something I've wanted a few
(read: many) times, and this is one of those times.... back to the guitar
now, but just looking to see if there's something I've missed, and if
there's not, maybe something I can work on.

Cheers

Paul
