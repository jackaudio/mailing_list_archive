a most emphatical "no", at least for professional use. of course 
resampling is a fact of life if you have to tie complex systems 
together, and for stuff like TV sound, nobody thinks twice about an 
extra resampling step if it simplifies things. but for music recordings, 
it's usually better to avoid it (besides, it's just conceptually 
inelegant to burn _lots_ of resources on something that can be avoided 
with proper systems design).
