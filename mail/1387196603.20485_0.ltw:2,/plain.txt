Perfect!

Oh reeeally, I didn't notice that.. ;-)

The custom data API stuff was a quick shot for iOS anyway. We just needed an 
extension for app/client icons. Actually I just wanted to add something like 
this:

    /// Defines exactly one pixel (32 bits) with alpha (translucency) channel.
    struct JackRGBA {
        char r; ///< Red component.
        char g; ///< Green component.
        char b; ///< Blue component.
        char a; ///< Alpha (translucency) component.
    } __attribute__ (packed);

    /// A picture in raw format (32 bit RGBA).
    struct JackRGBAImage {
        JackRGBA** data; ///< Accessed like foo.data[y][x];
        int w; ///< Width in pixels.
        int h; ///< Height in pixels.
    };

    /// Get icon of another JACK client, auto scaled to required size.
    JackRGBAImage* jack_get_client_icon(jack_client_t* client,
                                        const char* client_name,
                                        int preferred_icon_width);

    /// Register an icon for own JACK client.
    int jack_publish_icon(jack_client_t* client, const JackRGBAImage* icon);

    ...

But it was immediately rejected by Stephane and Paul with the words "Pictures 
in the JACK API??? I think the sky is falling!". :-)

Anyhow, ... guess we soon have the meta data API in JACK2 as well. Looking 
forward to your patch Filipe!
