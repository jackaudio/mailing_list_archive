yes.

Well, yes and no. Switching happens by stopping and starting [jackd
backends]. If jackdus is not running it can be launched when a device is
connected.

The three big issues are: port-connections, backend settings and clock
source (which devices becomes the main one).

In any professional or semi-pro environment you don't just want to add
some soundcard with some settings. Particularly if the soundcard has
more than 2 channels ("oops, just blasted the monitor speakers").
Furthermore different devices require different latency -I/-O settings,
amongst other things. -- I use a collection of dbus rules, a common
script for hierarchy and connections, plus per-device hook-scripts.
Things can quickly become complex fairly quickly.

The Maths does not change nor does it when applied to analog electronics.

Education of listener's ears changes as does the quality of 'prosumer'
soundcards.

Most modern systems have plenty of resources to provide sufficient
high-quality resampling to those ears in realtime. Besides, the quality
bottle-neck in many cases will be the crappy soundcard, not the digital
resampling algorithm.
