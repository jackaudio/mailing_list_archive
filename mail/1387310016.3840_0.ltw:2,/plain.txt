yes, it's called jack-devel, but caters for users, too.

Entirely appropriate. That approach works just fine here with older
versions of skype that support plain ALSA (I think newer versions of
skype are pulse only, but I don't know. I'm still using skype 2.2.0.25 I
just tested, still works). It gets me sound out of flash or any other
non-jack app.

Did you find
http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge
? It's somewhat verbose, but a very nice article with complete
step-by-step instructions and background information.

Long story short: You cannot write directly to the loop-hardware once
alsa_in/out are connected. You'll have to use an 'aggregated' device or
alsa-plug configured in a $HOME/.asoundrc (or similar).

Here 'aplay -d aduplex /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Right.wav'
works (but that's also the default) so just aplay .../file.wav

I use zita-ajbridge which is a drop-in replacement for alsa_in/out but
that's just a detail.

Here my ~/.asoundrc and a script to launch the bridge, which works here:

asoundrc: http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/asoundrc-loopback

 zita-a2j -L -d hw:Loopback,1,0 -j cloop -n 2 -p 256
 zita-j2a -L -d hw:Loopback,1,1 -j ploop -n 2 -p 256
 sleep 1
 jack_connect cloop:capture_1 system:playback_1 &>/dev/null
 jack_connect cloop:capture_2 system:playback_2 &>/dev/null
 jack_connect system:capture_1 ploop:playback_1 &>/dev/null
 jack_connect system:capture_2 ploop:playback_2 &>/dev/null

A more complex example and the details are described in the alsa wiki
article linked above.

HTH,
robin
