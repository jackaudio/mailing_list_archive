&gt; Entirely appropriate. That approach works just fine here with older
&gt; versions of skype that support plain ALSA (I think newer versions of
&gt; skype are pulse only, but I don't know. 

AFAICT Skype 4 supports both Pulse and Alsa.

&gt; Did you find
&gt; http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge
&gt; ? It's somewhat verbose, but a very nice article with complete
&gt; step-by-step instructions and background information.

Yes, I did find it, but it's quite focused on a different target than simply 
routing audio through Jack with a single sound card, and I couldn't manage to 
distinguish the parts to be ignored in my case. When I finished doing what's 
written there, I was stuck with no audio at all, be it Alsa or Jack. I must 
have done something wrong, but I can't tell what because I wasn't 
understanding most of the things I was doing.

&gt; Long story short: You cannot write directly to the loop-hardware once
&gt; alsa_in/out are connected. 

I'd say "oviously" here, except I didn't realize it myself... I think I took 
the opposite for granted because snd_aloop creates two soundcards, so I 
assumed I could lock one with Jack and the other with Alsa.

&gt; asoundrc: http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/asoundrc-loopback

Ok, I don't want to make the loop be the default device, for the time being: 
this way if something goes wrong i can just stop jackd and everything keeps 
working through Alsa. Should I avoid or change the last part ("pcm.!default") 
of that asoundrc then?

&gt; 
&gt;  zita-a2j -L -d hw:Loopback,1,0 -j cloop -n 2 -p 256
&gt;  zita-j2a -L -d hw:Loopback,1,1 -j ploop -n 2 -p 256
&gt;  sleep 1
&gt;  jack_connect cloop:capture_1 system:playback_1 &amp;&gt;/dev/null
&gt;  jack_connect cloop:capture_2 system:playback_2 &amp;&gt;/dev/null
&gt;  jack_connect system:capture_1 ploop:playback_1 &amp;&gt;/dev/null
&gt;  jack_connect system:capture_2 ploop:playback_2 &amp;&gt;/dev/null

I assume I could also make connections through the patchbay in qjackctl 
instead of using jack_connect, right? It's a more trial-and-error friendly 
method for the beginners...
