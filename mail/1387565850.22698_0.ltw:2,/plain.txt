Thank you very much, that was the problem. But now there's another...

What's the "-L" option you pass to zita-j2a? It's not documented in the 
manpage and if I use it I get

$ zita-j2a -d hw:0,1 -r 48000 -p 256 -L
Can't open ALSA playback device 'hw:0,1'.

On the other hand, without -L, it starts without errors, but I still get plain 
silence both in playback and capture. I've tried both with the qjackctl 
patchbay and the jack_connect commands.

Just in case you wonder:

$ dpkg -l | grep zita
...
ii  zita-ajbridge 0.4.0-1  amd64   alsa to jack bridge
