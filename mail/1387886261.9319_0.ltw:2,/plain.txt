Ok, no replies, that must mean something. Let zita alone for now, I switch 
back to alsa_in, alsa_out.

Using the (in)famous howto 

http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge

I'm able to start alsa_in and alsa_out only if I use the most generic version 
of asoundrc, e.g. the first one in the howto: even then, I still get plain 
silence.

If I use the second version of asoundrc as found in the howto, things are 
worse:

$ alsa_in -j cloop -dcloop -q 1
Broken configuration for playback: no configurations available: Invalid argument
Setting of hwparams failed: Invalid argument

Please guide me step by step, that howto has clearly something not suitable 
for my hardware, but I don't understand what I am doing while following it, so 
I'm not able to find what to do different.
