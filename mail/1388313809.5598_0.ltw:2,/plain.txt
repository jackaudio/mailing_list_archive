Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Problems with audioadapter used with capture only interface

What worked for me, was (in three different consoles of the embedded system):
# jackd -r -dnet -i -C0 -P1
# alsa_in -d hw:0,1 -r48000 -p256 -n3
# jack_connect alsa_in:capture_1 system:playback_1
however then I had some problems with xruns/latency

Is such solution acceptable as a substitute of not working audioadapter?
Can I expect that with fixed audioadapter I should be able to reach lower
latency and less risk of xrun?
