Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Problems with audioadapter used with capture only interface

Hi,

I wanted to use jack2 with an embedded system equipped with capture
only interface.
I can start the server with the net backend:

# jackd -r -dnet  -C0 -P1
jackdmp 1.9.10

JACK server starting in non-realtime mode

Waiting for a master...
Initializing connection with WZlap...
**************** Network parameters ****************
Name : buildroot

****************************************************

However, when I try to load the audioadapter i get:

# jack_load audioadapter -i "-C hw:0,1 -r48000 -p256 -n3 "
could not load audioadapter, intclient = 0 status = 0x 1

and the server displays:
Ringbuffer automatic adaptative mode size = 4096 frames
../linux/alsa/JackAlsaAdapter.h:226, alsa error -2 : No such file or
directory

I have checked the line ../linux/alsa/JackAlsaAdapter.h:226 and found,
that the "open" function defined here ALWAYS tries to open the
soundcard both as capture and playback device.

How can I patch this function so that the playback part is attemted to
open only if the audiodapter is loaded for playback or both for
capture and playback?

Probably people wanting to use audioadapter with playback only devices
will face the similar problem...
