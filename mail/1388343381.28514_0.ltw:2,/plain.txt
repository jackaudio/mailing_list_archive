Hello Wojciech,

Afaik the net backend doesn't have -C and -P options, also -i needs an
integer as a value. So the first command should throw out an error. And
it seems like you're trying to run JACK as root and with the -r option
while you probably want to use JACK with -R (which is also the default).
Using alsa_in increases the change of xruns and it also increases
latency. And in your first mail you said that you were dealing with a
capture only interface which makes me wonder where the system:playback_1
JACK port comes from. Could you provide some more information on your
setup? What's in /proc/asound/cards?

Best,

Jeremy
