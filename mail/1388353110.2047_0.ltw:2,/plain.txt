Hi Jeremy,

the whole design is a WiFi based wireless guitar system.
Therefore the audio samples must be transmitted to the jack running on a PC
working as a virtual amplifier and the Digital Audio Workstation.
In fact I'm still considering getting rid of jack at the embedded system
side. From the latency point of view the optimal solution would be to
transmit the data directly from the soundcard via net to something like
modified alsa_in on the PC. I have even considered making of virtual ALSA
card with network input.
Regards,
Wojtek
