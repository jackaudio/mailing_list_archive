Hi Wojtek,

Thanks for the explanation! Sounds like a cool idea. Why not run the
virtual amp directly on the embedded device? Not enough processing
power? And of course you could try using ALSA directly but from personal
experience I can say that using JACK might just be the easiest option.

Best,

Jeremy
