Hi Jeremy,

The whole idea was started as an upgrade of my old system:
 http://www.ise.pw.edu.pl/~wzab/wireless_guitar_system/index.html
The whole device must be small, and either attached to the guitar itself,
or to the strap, so that the guitarist can conveniently select tone
and make some
settings adjustments.
The device should also consume as small power as possible, so that it
can work long from small and lightweight batteries.
That's why no virtual amp in the device itself.
Current version of hardware is available at:
https://github.com/wzab/raspberry-pi-guitar-system-v1/tree/master/kicad-project-v1

As the latency problem is essential, I'm simply afraid that in the
configuration:
Codec-ALSA-Jack-Net-Jack the latency will be introduced twice - in
both jack servers.
In the ALSA based solution, the samples could be collected and
transferred immediately
as they are available.
At the receiving side, I considered either something based on snd-aloop
with user-space application receiving data from the network
or something like minivosc:
https://github.com/stadaki/alsa-minivosc-src
http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Minivosc
The latter would be especially efficient with private kernel-space implemented
lightweight reliable network protocol (e.g. something like what I've created for
FPGA based DAQ systems - http://opencores.org/project,fade_ether_protocol )
The data from virtual ALSA card will be received by standard alsa_in
or audioadapter
(which of course will introduce some additional latency due to synchronization).
