Hello Jeremy,

OK. In fact the "-i" option is ignored. so -C0 and -P1 are interpreted
by the jackd
itself.
If I start "jackd -R -dnet -i -C0 -P1" (or "jackd -R -dnet -C0 -P1")
on the embedded system,
I get the following ports on the DAW PC:

$ jack_lsp
system:capture_1
system:capture_2
system:playback_1
system:playback_2
system:playback_3
system:playback_4
buildroot:from_slave_1

if I start simply "jackd -R -dnet", i get :
$ jack_lsp
system:capture_1
system:capture_2
system:playback_1
system:playback_2
system:playback_3
system:playback_4
buildroot:to_slave_1
buildroot:to_slave_2
buildroot:from_slave_1
buildroot:from_slave_2
buildroot:from_slave_3
buildroot:from_slave_4

Yes, you are right. I've mistaken copying that from the console.

As I start jack with the "net" backend, the port which is used to
connect to the master
is the "playback port". I need to connect the capture port associated
with my soundcard
(which is added by the alsa_in or by audio_adapter) this port to
transmit my audio.
