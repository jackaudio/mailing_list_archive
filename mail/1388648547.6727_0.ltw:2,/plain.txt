Subject:     [Jack-Devel] question about jackosx and surround sound

Hello everybody,

I'm new in this group... but need some help :-/
Ih have following setup

Mac Mini Server 2013, Mac OS 10.9.1, with the latest jackosx (0.9 beta 17) and a Multichannel Fire Wire Audio Interface Prism Orpheus. 
I have on channel 1&2 of the Prism Orpheus 2 mono amps für the midrange tops and on chanel 3&4 a servo controller für the bass amp and speakers. On Channel 5 & 6 I have large fullrange surround speakers. 

So for stereo I would like to route 
Left to Channel 1 & 3
Richt to 2 & 4

And for surround sound I would like to route
main left to channel 1 & 3
main right to channel 2 & 4
center to channel 1, 2, 3 & 4
rear l to channel 5
rear r to channel 6
sub to 3, 4, 5 & 6

The good news is, that the stereo routing works works  perfectiy with jackosx:-)
But watching surround sound movies doesnt't work. vlc says, that I have to configure the jackpilot device in audio midi setup, when I choose "Audio Device Jackpilot" in vlc and switch to multichannel aac or to ac3 track. Quicktime / iTunes also just plays the stereo tracks and not the multichannel tracks. (Certainly I set up jackpilot to have 8 I/Os)

2/3 years ago I had the same setup with Mac OS 10.7 and an older jackosx version and it worked. Do you have any idea?
Thanks for your help,

Marcus
