I don't really get this. How do I do this? Don't know if this helps, but
after I start jack from the terminal like this:
$ jackd -d firewire

I start Pure Data in another terminal window with '-jack' and '-rt' (for
realtime) and in the jack terminal the following comments appear:
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 2
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error

Does this mean something bad? When I play sound with Pure Data, every now
and then the audio stops for a few ms or even a second and then comes back.
Also, if I move windows around or switch between applications the audio
stops until I stop all actions. I guess all this shouldn't be happening..
Any tips?
