If I need to ...

This problem was a difficult one to diagnose. As it turns out, I think 
I've pinpointed it to the combination usage of PulseAudio and google-chrome.

I have been running the PulseAudio JACK sink/source from day one without 
problems but very recently installed google-chrome. The only time I get 
any kind of xruns is when google-chrome is open and as it turns out, 
quite exaggerated (as reported below) with net manager.

After a few trial and errors, I realized that closing chrome quieted the 
xruns. So I have 4 midi-out ports (16 channels each) connected over the 
network returning 48 audio channels. I haven't exercised it completely, 
but connection is clean without xruns... so far so good.
