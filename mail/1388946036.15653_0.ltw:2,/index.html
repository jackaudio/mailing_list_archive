&gt;&gt; Hi Alexandros,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; $ sudo aptitude install libjack-jackd2-dev
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You for sure installed something else, since this are only headers you
&gt;&gt; need, when compiling software, this package isn't needed to run jackd.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm on ubuntu 12.04 on a macbook 5,2
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't know the Macbook, but on "PC"s it's important to use a fixed
&gt;&gt; frequency for the CPU frequency scaling. IOW if CPU frequency scaling is
&gt;&gt; set to "ondemand", it likely will cause issues.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; I don't really get this. How do I do this? Don't know if this helps, but
&gt; after I start jack from the terminal like this:
&gt; $ jackd -d firewire
&gt;
I googled it and found that I should install indicator-cpufreq which I did
and I can now set a fixed frequency for CPU but it won't help...There are a
few options which I tried out (like 'Performance') which also won't help.
Could there be something broken with the firewire or jack drivers? There
are quite some things I've been trying which won't change the current
state. I still get drop outs where sound stops for half or even a whole
second and then comes back.
Just a reminder, I'm using jack in order to use my firewire sound card with
Pure Data. I'm on a macbook 5,2 with Ubuntu 12.04, Jack 1.9.8 and
Pd-0.45-4. Has anyone faced similar problems?

&gt;
&gt; I start Pure Data in another terminal window with '-jack' and '-rt' (for
&gt; realtime) and in the jack terminal the following comments appear:
&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 2
&gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt;
&gt; Does this mean something bad? When I play sound with Pure Data, every now
&gt; and then the audio stops for a few ms or even a second and then comes back.
&gt; Also, if I move windows around or switch between applications the audio
&gt; stops until I stop all actions. I guess all this shouldn't be happening..
&gt; Any tips?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt; Ralf
