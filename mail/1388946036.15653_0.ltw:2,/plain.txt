I googled it and found that I should install indicator-cpufreq which I did
and I can now set a fixed frequency for CPU but it won't help...There are a
few options which I tried out (like 'Performance') which also won't help.
Could there be something broken with the firewire or jack drivers? There
are quite some things I've been trying which won't change the current
state. I still get drop outs where sound stops for half or even a whole
second and then comes back.
Just a reminder, I'm using jack in order to use my firewire sound card with
Pure Data. I'm on a macbook 5,2 with Ubuntu 12.04, Jack 1.9.8 and
Pd-0.45-4. Has anyone faced similar problems?
