Yes, I noticed that, and just because jack_port_get_all_connections says -

"You need not be the owner of the port to get information about its
connections."

I wouldn't necessarily read that as jack_port_get_connections meaning -

You need *to* be the owner of the port to get information about its connections.

I assumed that meant that jack_port_get_connections doesn't
*guarantee* to provide this information for ports you don't own, not
that it mustn't.

Best wishes,

Neil
