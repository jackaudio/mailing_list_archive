Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 2 JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error

I'm running jack to use my firewire sound card (presonus firebox) with pure
data running this in the terminal: $ jackd -dfirewire
and jack runs with the firewire. But when I open pure data in another
terminal window with this $ pd -rt -jack
I get this in jack's terminal:
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 2
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
and the audio every now and then quits for half or a whole second and then
comes back. Does this error say something about this behaviour? I've tried
several stuff but can't get it to work properly. I also tried jack with
audacity and I got drop outs there as well. I'm on ubuntu 12.04 with jack
1.9.8
Can anyone help me out?
