I *think* this indicates an issue in PureData.  However, if others more
familiar with jackd messages indicate that it's a problem within FFADO I'll
take this up.  If it is a FFADO problem it would be best to take the
discussion to the ffado-user mailing list (detail are in the "Contact" link
the ffado.org.

After the dropout, is PureData usable and does the Firebox play back PureData
audio?

Is the error message similar?  If it is it would tend to suggest that the
problem is not within PureData or audacity.

It would be worth trying a lowlatency kernel if you're not already using
one.  This should be available via the Ubuntu package manager.
