&gt; &gt; I'm running jack to use my firewire sound card (presonus firebox) with

&gt; &gt; and jack runs with the firewire. But when I open pure data in another
&gt; &gt; terminal window with this $ pd -rt -jack
&gt; &gt; I get this in jack's terminal:
&gt; &gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 2
&gt; &gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; &gt; and the audio every now and then quits for half or a whole second and
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; comes back.
&gt;
&gt; I *think* this indicates an issue in PureData.  However, if others more
&gt; familiar with jackd messages indicate that it's a problem within FFADO I'll
&gt; take this up.  If it is a FFADO problem it would be best to take the
&gt; discussion to the ffado-user mailing list (detail are in the "Contact" link
&gt; the ffado.org.
&gt;
&gt; After the dropout, is PureData usable and does the Firebox play back
&gt; PureData
&gt; audio?
&gt;
Yes Pure Data is usable and the Firebox does play the Pure Data audio

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I also tried jack with audacity and I got drop outs there as well.
&gt;
&gt; Is the error message similar?  If it is it would tend to suggest that the
&gt; problem is not within PureData or audacity.
&gt;
There's no error printed when I open Audacity, but when I close it this is
printed in Jack's terminal:
JackProcessSync::LockedTimedWait error usec = 426660 err = Connection timed
out
JackEngine::ClientDeactivate wait error ref = 3 name = PortAudio

No idea if this should be or not..also, when I quit Pd though, I get this
in Jack's terminal:
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm on ubuntu 12.04 with jack 1.9.8
&gt; &gt; Can anyone help me out?
&gt;
&gt; It would be worth trying a lowlatency kernel if you're not already using
&gt; one.  This should be available via the Ubuntu package manager.
&gt;
Hmm, I'm a noob to Linux, some tips on how to do this? what should I type
in the synaptic package manager? If I type lowlatency I get a bunch of
stuff (linux-headers-lowlatenct, linux-image-lowlatency etc.)
