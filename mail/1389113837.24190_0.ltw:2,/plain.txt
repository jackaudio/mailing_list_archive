Yes Pure Data is usable and the Firebox does play the Pure Data audio

There's no error printed when I open Audacity, but when I close it this is
printed in Jack's terminal:
JackProcessSync::LockedTimedWait error usec = 426660 err = Connection timed
out
JackEngine::ClientDeactivate wait error ref = 3 name = PortAudio

No idea if this should be or not..also, when I quit Pd though, I get this
in Jack's terminal:
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe

Hmm, I'm a noob to Linux, some tips on how to do this? what should I type
in the synaptic package manager? If I type lowlatency I get a bunch of
stuff (linux-headers-lowlatenct, linux-image-lowlatency etc.)
