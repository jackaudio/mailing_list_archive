&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm running jack to use my firewire sound card (presonus firebox) with pure
&gt; &gt; &gt; data running this in the terminal: $ jackd -dfirewire
&gt; &gt; &gt; and jack runs with the firewire. But when I open pure data in another
&gt; &gt; &gt; terminal window with this $ pd -rt -jack
&gt; &gt; &gt; I get this in jack's terminal:
&gt; &gt; &gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the audio every now and then quits for half or a whole second and then
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes back.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I *think* this indicates an issue in PureData.  However, if others more
&gt; &gt; familiar with jackd messages indicate that it's a problem within FFADO I'll
&gt; &gt; take this up.  If it is a FFADO problem it would be best to take the
&gt; &gt; discussion to the ffado-user mailing list (detail are in the "Contact" link
&gt; &gt; the ffado.org.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After the dropout, is PureData usable and does the Firebox play back
&gt; &gt; PureData
&gt; &gt; audio?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Yes Pure Data is usable and the Firebox does play the Pure Data audio

Hmm, interesting.  Do you only see the dropouts when you *start* PureData. 
If so then it would appear that the problem might be associated with
application startup or some issue with the way PureData does things while
its jack system is starting up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I also tried jack with audacity and I got drop outs there as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is the error message similar?  If it is it would tend to suggest that the
&gt; &gt; problem is not within PureData or audacity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; There's no error printed when I open Audacity, but when I close it this is
&gt; printed in Jack's terminal:
&gt; JackProcessSync::LockedTimedWait error usec = 426660 err = Connection timed
&gt; out
&gt; JackEngine::ClientDeactivate wait error ref = 3 name = PortAudio
&gt; 
&gt; No idea if this should be or not..

No, me neither.

&gt; also, when I quit Pd though, I get this
&gt; in Jack's terminal:
&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
&gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe

I don't run PureData myself.  It would be interesting to hear whether others
see this.  This in turn may provide a clue as to whether it is related in
some way to the start up glitch.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm on ubuntu 12.04 with jack 1.9.8
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can anyone help me out?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It would be worth trying a lowlatency kernel if you're not already using
&gt; &gt; one.  This should be available via the Ubuntu package manager.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Hmm, I'm a noob to Linux, some tips on how to do this? what should I type
&gt; in the synaptic package manager? If I type lowlatency I get a bunch of
&gt; stuff (linux-headers-lowlatenct, linux-image-lowlatency etc.)

Hopefully an ubuntu user can chime in here.  I'd have to see a full list of
the "lowlatency" matchs and guess based on name.
