Hmm, interesting.  Do you only see the dropouts when you *start* PureData. 
If so then it would appear that the problem might be associated with
application startup or some issue with the way PureData does things while
its jack system is starting up.

No, me neither.

I don't run PureData myself.  It would be interesting to hear whether others
see this.  This in turn may provide a clue as to whether it is related in
some way to the start up glitch.

Hopefully an ubuntu user can chime in here.  I'd have to see a full list of
the "lowlatency" matchs and guess based on name.
