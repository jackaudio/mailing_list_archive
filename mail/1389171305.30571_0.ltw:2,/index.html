&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm running jack to use my firewire sound card (presonus firebox) with pure

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and jack runs with the firewire. But when I open pure data in another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; terminal window with this $ pd -rt -jack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I get this in jack's terminal:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the audio every now and then quits for half or a whole second and then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comes back.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I *think* this indicates an issue in PureData.  However, if others more
&gt;&gt;&gt; familiar with jackd messages indicate that it's a problem within FFADO I'll
&gt;&gt;&gt; take this up.  If it is a FFADO problem it would be best to take the
&gt;&gt;&gt; discussion to the ffado-user mailing list (detail are in the "Contact" link
&gt;&gt;&gt; the ffado.org.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; After the dropout, is PureData usable and does the Firebox play back
&gt;&gt;&gt; PureData
&gt;&gt;&gt; audio?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes Pure Data is usable and the Firebox does play the Pure Data audio
&gt; Hmm, interesting.  Do you only see the dropouts when you *start* PureData. 
&gt; If so then it would appear that the problem might be associated with
&gt; application startup or some issue with the way PureData does things while
&gt; its jack system is starting up.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also tried jack with audacity and I got drop outs there as well.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is the error message similar?  If it is it would tend to suggest that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem is not within PureData or audacity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There's no error printed when I open Audacity, but when I close it this is
&gt;&gt; printed in Jack's terminal:
&gt;&gt; JackProcessSync::LockedTimedWait error usec = 426660 err = Connection timed
&gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt; JackEngine::ClientDeactivate wait error ref = 3 name = PortAudio
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No idea if this should be or not..
&gt; No, me neither.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; also, when I quit Pd though, I get this
&gt;&gt; in Jack's terminal:
&gt;&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
&gt;&gt; JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt;&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt;&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt;&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt;&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt;&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt;&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt;&gt; Cannot write socket fd = 44 err = Broken pipe
&gt; I don't run PureData myself.  It would be interesting to hear whether others
&gt; see this.  This in turn may provide a clue as to whether it is related in
&gt; some way to the start up glitch.
I can confirm this, I get those messages too from time to time when
trying to use Pd's Jack backend.
It does run once in a while with Jack, but then there are terrible audio
latencies (~0.5s!) to live event
inputs (OSC, MIDI) which makes it pretty much useless for me.

Pd 0.45.3, jackdmp 1.9.9.5, ArchLinux, kernel 3.12.6 x86_64

Apart from Pd, my Jack/audio setup works flawlessly, which makes Pd the
most probable culprit and not Jack itself, IMHO.
I'd recommend to search/ask the Pd list whether this is a known issue,
additionally.

Pd works fine with ALSA directly, though.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm on ubuntu 12.04 with jack 1.9.8
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can anyone help me out?
&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be worth trying a lowlatency kernel if you're not already using
&gt;&gt;&gt; one.  This should be available via the Ubuntu package manager.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hmm, I'm a noob to Linux, some tips on how to do this? what should I type
&gt;&gt; in the synaptic package manager? If I type lowlatency I get a bunch of
&gt;&gt; stuff (linux-headers-lowlatenct, linux-image-lowlatency etc.)
&gt; Hopefully an ubuntu user can chime in here.  I'd have to see a full list of
&gt; the "lowlatency" matchs and guess based on name.
