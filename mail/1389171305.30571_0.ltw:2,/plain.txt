I can confirm this, I get those messages too from time to time when
trying to use Pd's Jack backend.
It does run once in a while with Jack, but then there are terrible audio
latencies (~0.5s!) to live event
inputs (OSC, MIDI) which makes it pretty much useless for me.

Pd 0.45.3, jackdmp 1.9.9.5, ArchLinux, kernel 3.12.6 x86_64

Apart from Pd, my Jack/audio setup works flawlessly, which makes Pd the
most probable culprit and not Jack itself, IMHO.
I'd recommend to search/ask the Pd list whether this is a known issue,
additionally.

Pd works fine with ALSA directly, though.
