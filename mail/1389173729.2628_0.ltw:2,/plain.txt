I started pd as 'pd -jack'

JACK messages were OK
I suspended pd with Ctrl-Z

I saw this:

JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
20:26:07.073 XRUN callback (1).
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
JackEngine::XRun: client = pure_data_0 was not run: state = 1
...

- until I run pd in the background with
bg
