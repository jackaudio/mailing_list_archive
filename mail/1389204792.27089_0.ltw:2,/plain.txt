This pretty much sums it up. It's heavy work-in-progress, far far away
from feature-complete (sometimes no clock selection, sometimes
playback-only).

I'm also happy to see the move to kernel space, one of my former
students has contributed some bits on DICE support, and we ran
bidirectional streaming at different rates without FFADO.


AFAIK, there's currently no userspace API for the various device
settings (clock, phantom power, other toggle options...), which either
could be done via ALSA's mixer API (like the RME drivers) or via
something completely different, but this would require additional
userspace tools.


In any case, exciting progress. As a rule of thumb, I'd say: If you're
somewhat familiar with device drivers (as in "hack a line or two") and
compiling kernels from git, it's worth a shot. Otherwise, wait until
it's in mainline. (read: under no circumstances, recommend this to the
occasional user who already has problems installing Ubuntu)


Cheers
