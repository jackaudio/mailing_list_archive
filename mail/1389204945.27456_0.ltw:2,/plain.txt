Well, a thread can always take its own way, but as the 'poster' of this
thread, yes, I was asking whether (and if yes, how) can I use my Presonus
Firebox with Jack and Pure Data on Ubuntu 12.04.
As far as sending data to ALSA and using the alsa-to-jack-bridge, I don't
think that it will do, as it not just Pure Data, I also get drop outs with
Audacity, so it must be something with the Firewire and the specific sound
card. In FFADO's device support page, it's mentioned that this sound card
is 'reported to work <http://ffado.org/?q=devicesupport/list&page=2>'
(bottom of the page).
Is anyone using this sound card with any Linux distribution? I'd be happy
to change my Linux distribution if I can use Pure Data and my Firebox...
