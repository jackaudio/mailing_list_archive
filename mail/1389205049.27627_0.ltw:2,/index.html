&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can I use my firewire sound card with ALSA?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; sure you can: https://github.com/takaswie/snd-firewire-improve.git
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i'm fairly sure that original poster was not asking about whether or not
&gt; &gt; they can rebuild their kernel with work-in-progress drivers. ALSA support
&gt; &gt; for firewire audio interfaces is awesome and exciting but AFAIK, the work
&gt; &gt; is not done yet.
&gt;
&gt; This pretty much sums it up. It's heavy work-in-progress, far far away
&gt; from feature-complete (sometimes no clock selection, sometimes
&gt; playback-only).
&gt;
&gt; I'm also happy to see the move to kernel space, one of my former
&gt; students has contributed some bits on DICE support, and we ran
&gt; bidirectional streaming at different rates without FFADO.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; AFAIK, there's currently no userspace API for the various device
&gt; settings (clock, phantom power, other toggle options...), which either
&gt; could be done via ALSA's mixer API (like the RME drivers) or via
&gt; something completely different, but this would require additional
&gt; userspace tools.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In any case, exciting progress. As a rule of thumb, I'd say: If you're
&gt; somewhat familiar with device drivers (as in "hack a line or two") and
&gt; compiling kernels from git, it's worth a shot. Otherwise, wait until
&gt; it's in mainline. (read: under no circumstances, recommend this to the
&gt; occasional user who already has problems installing Ubuntu)
&gt;
With some directions I guess I could 'hack a line or two', but I am
certainly not a programmer. I had no problems installing Ubuntu, or
partitioning my hard drive. I don't mind messing around with some stuff or
trying things out, it's a good way to learn. But only if someone who know
is willing to give me some directions..

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
