Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack for windows : ASIO Driver compatiblity

Hi everyone,

I'm a novice programmer, and I'm doing DSP in windows using ASIO VST HOST
softwares.

My big problem is to redirect the windows audio output to my VST HOST
inputs, running the ASIO driver of the soundcard.

I found that the problem could be bypassed in linux since along time ago,
but in linux i had getting headaches finding a stable distribution, running
vst plugins etc.

In windows everything is simplier, except for audio routing.....

I tried you jack for windows version, and be able to run the JackRouter
driver with multiple softwares,  allowing me to route audio to my VST HOST
and then to jack, which outputs the resulting signal to the output of my
sound card.

The problem is that the JackRouter ASIO driver works on a basic ASIO host
application, on another software called "Console", but not in :

- foobar with ASIO plugin (driver JackRouter is listed but when trying to
play a song the software cannot use correctly the driver)
- windows media player (same I guess)
- HolmImpulse (the JackRouter driver is not listed)

Furthermore, ASIO4ALL doesn't show the JackRouter in the soundcard list too.


I'm sure the JackRouter driver ASIO compatiblity with software could be
increase to be able to run the driver on near every ASIO software on
windows, but I don't know how (furthermore I don't know at all how I can
get access to the JackRouter driver sources).

I think resolving this problem would be a very very nice improvement, and
I'm ready to try to work with some of you in this issue.


Thanks for your interest !
