You should try the other way around, select ASIO4ALL as the "interface" 
in Jack control. Note however that using ASIO4ALL will "lock down" your 
soundcard (exclusive mode), meaning you won't be able to use any device 
that doesn't support ASIO while ASIO4ALL is active.

Never tried Foobar, so no idea what the problem might be. I know for 
instance that Traktor requires a minimum of 256 frames/period. Maybe 
Foobar has a similar problem.

WMP does not support ASIO at all. WMP only works with devices listed in 
the system's Playback devices.

Something to try is using VAC (Virtual Audio Cable) but it's a hassle to 
set up correctly in my experience.

You can send WMP to VAC and then set VAC as the input device in Jack 
control. Through the Jack Connection window (in Jack Control), you can 
then route the "input" (being VAC) to whatever device listed there.
