To provide further clarification about this, the snd-firewire driver work is
the first visible sign of moving the FFADO audio streaming code into the
kernel (device control will most likely be userspace due to certain
reasons).  I expect that once the initial code by Takashi is done we will
start to see more movement of the FFADO streaming component into the kernel
by using the initial drivers as a template.  I am very keen to do this for
the devices I maintain but there is a currently a lack of documentation
about how to go about writing such a driver within the ALSA framework. 
Hense the reliance on an initial driver as a template.

Having said that, snd-firewire is, as Paul said, a work in progress
experimental driver.  YMMV and it currently supports only certain devices
(each device family requires its own driver code; the current code is for
some DICE and BeBoB devices).  I believe the initial code may be pulled for
3.13 or 3.14 but further tweaks will almost certainly be needed.  This is
still very much under development and testing is certainly welcomed. 
However, it is certainly not ready for end-users who just need things to
work.

I hope this helps.
