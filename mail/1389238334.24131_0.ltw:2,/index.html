&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can I use my firewire sound card with ALSA?

&gt; &gt; &gt; sure you can: https://github.com/takaswie/snd-firewire-improve.git
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i'm fairly sure that original poster was not asking about whether or not
&gt; &gt; they can rebuild their kernel with work-in-progress drivers. ALSA support
&gt; &gt; for firewire audio interfaces is awesome and exciting but AFAIK, the work
&gt; &gt; is not done yet.
&gt; 
&gt; This pretty much sums it up. It's heavy work-in-progress, far far away
&gt; from feature-complete (sometimes no clock selection, sometimes
&gt; playback-only).

Agreed.

&gt; AFAIK, there's currently no userspace API for the various device
&gt; settings (clock, phantom power, other toggle options...), which either
&gt; could be done via ALSA's mixer API (like the RME drivers) or via
&gt; something completely different, but this would require additional
&gt; userspace tools.

The current plan is to stick with the existing FFADO "mixer"
control/settings framework.  While some devices are simple enough that the
ALSA mixer API *could* be used, there are others for which it is unlikely to
work well.  We'll see how it pans out.  In any case, kernel streaming is the
most important part from the stability and usability point of view.

&gt; In any case, exciting progress. As a rule of thumb, I'd say: If you're
&gt; somewhat familiar with device drivers (as in "hack a line or two") and
&gt; compiling kernels from git, it's worth a shot. Otherwise, wait until
&gt; it's in mainline. (read: under no circumstances, recommend this to the
&gt; occasional user who already has problems installing Ubuntu)

Correct; I agree completely.
