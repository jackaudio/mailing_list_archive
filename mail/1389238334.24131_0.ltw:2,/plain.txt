Agreed.

The current plan is to stick with the existing FFADO "mixer"
control/settings framework.  While some devices are simple enough that the
ALSA mixer API *could* be used, there are others for which it is unlikely to
work well.  We'll see how it pans out.  In any case, kernel streaming is the
most important part from the stability and usability point of view.

Correct; I agree completely.
