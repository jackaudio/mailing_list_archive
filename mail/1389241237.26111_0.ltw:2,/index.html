Hi Alexandros

&gt; Well, a thread can always take its own way, but as the 'poster' of this
&gt; thread, yes, I was asking whether (and if yes, how) can I use my Presonus
&gt; Firebox with Jack and Pure Data on Ubuntu 12.04.
&gt; As far as sending data to ALSA and using the alsa-to-jack-bridge, I don't
&gt; think that it will do, as it not just Pure Data, I also get drop outs with
&gt; Audacity, so it must be something with the Firewire and the specific sound
&gt; card. In FFADO's device support page, it's mentioned that this sound card
&gt; is 'reported to work &lt;http://ffado.org/?q=devicesupport/list&amp;page=2&gt;'
&gt; (bottom of the page).

It may be a separate issue, but are you using a "lowlatency" kernel?

&gt; Is anyone using this sound card with any Linux distribution? I'd be happy
&gt; to change my Linux distribution if I can use Pure Data and my Firebox...

People are using the Firebox successfully under Linux with FFADO.  PureData
seems to be slightly problematic in its jackd support, but others using the
firebox were not, as far as I recall, using pd.  So there *may* be a pd
issue at play under all this in your case.

I vaguely recall a PD discussion on the FFADO lists during 2013, and the end
result might have been a patch to PD.  The details escape me at present but
I can't check the archive for this right now, so I don't know if it might be
relevant to your situation.  Checking the FFADO user and devel lists might
still be worth a shot.
