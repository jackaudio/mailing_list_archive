It may be a separate issue, but are you using a "lowlatency" kernel?

People are using the Firebox successfully under Linux with FFADO.  PureData
seems to be slightly problematic in its jackd support, but others using the
firebox were not, as far as I recall, using pd.  So there *may* be a pd
issue at play under all this in your case.

I vaguely recall a PD discussion on the FFADO lists during 2013, and the end
result might have been a patch to PD.  The details escape me at present but
I can't check the archive for this right now, so I don't know if it might be
relevant to your situation.  Checking the FFADO user and devel lists might
still be worth a shot.
