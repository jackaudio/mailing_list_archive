Correct, just type jack_metro -b 105 in a terminal, and if you have the
connection dialog in qjackctl open you should see a new jack client
displayed in the source ports side.  You select the jack_metro client in
the source port window, then select the system output ports in the sink
window, press the connect button, and qjackctl should draw lines from
jack_metro to the output ports indicating that they are now connected. 
Make sure you have an external volume control on your audio output and
that it is turned down, because as soon as you make the connection you
will get an annoyingly loud "pip, pip, pip" from your speakers.  There is
a way to set the amplitude in the commands to jack_metro, but in the
interest of simplicity I assumed you probably had some type of volume
control between your audio interface and speakers.
