I hesitated to name a specific software because I don't use them myself,
and do not know which solution is the easiest to set up.

The best quality is the zita-ajbridge.

I do not know if Ubuntu has it available, you may have to build from source:
http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/downloads/zita-ajbridge-0.4.0.tar.bz2

The jack package should have alsa_in and alsa_out included.  I think those
were intended to be used for using multiple audio interfaces when the
interfaces could not be synchronized properly (e.g. with an external word
clock connection), but there is a way to use them as a pseudo-soundcard
that ALSA aware applications can use directly which then transfer the
audio data to jack:
http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge

There is another method which apparently required an ALSA plugin, but I do
not know what the name of that plugin would be in the Ubuntu repositories.
 Hopefully someone else here who uses Ubuntu and jack could help:
