It occurred to me that you did not mention before how you connected your
applications to jack.  If they automatically connect their audio outputs
to jack you may not be aware that jack is like a very flexible patch bay,
and most jack aware applications either do not automatically connect, or
give you the option to set whether the application automatically connects
or not.

The most frequently used application for starting jack and managing
connections is called qjackctl (because it is a jack control application,
and is written using the Qt toolkit).
qjackctl should be available in the Ubuntu software repositories.

Without using qjackctl you would have to use a command line application
jack_connect to connect the metronome application to your output ports. 
To do that you would have to first use jack_lsp to list all the ports to
find the correct name of the ports to connect.  I use command line for a
lot of things, but generally qjackctl will be the easier way to go for
jack setup.
