That patch is over three years old. It seems like you have found a
loophole in the logic that was used to justify it.

Granted, it's annoying but it just means we have to find a better solution.

Similar to Fon's main objection to jack-session being *not flexible
enough*. We all knew it would cause problems for specific use cases but we
still haven't found a perfect solution to enable the flexibility that Fons
identified while also allowing people to get on with the task at hand.
Hence we have the less flexible but still useful for most use cases
version of jack session.
