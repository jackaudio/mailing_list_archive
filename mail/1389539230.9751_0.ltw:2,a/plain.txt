With the cgroups, that flexibility exist. One of the main point
of the cgroups is to be flexible enough to be setup for any possible
use case. But with a systemd system, that flexibility doesn't exist
any more, because the only possible "normal" use case permitted by
systemd is to run a GUI (as stated by the "normal" one in charge of this
mess).

It is more than 1 year I use the cgroups within an openrc system,
and you can do whatever you want with the cgroups. The same apply for
sysv init system.

What made me mad in that story, is not because it is a bug into systemd
which made a kernel function to misbehave, I know very well that
the only one that doesn't make bugs is the one that doesn't make
code, but this is the complete lack of consideration for other needs
than what he consider to be the needs of a "normal desktop user". Which
strongly suggest users with other needs are abnormal users. Which in
turn imply that person is a racist when he suggest I am abnormal. And I
am not the only one, systemd will break any cgroup configuration for
any other use case than to run a GUI.
