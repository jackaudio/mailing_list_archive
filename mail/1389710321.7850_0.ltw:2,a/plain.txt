I tried to debug using some printf and recompiling the JackRouter driver.
It seems the foobar call the driver functions :

init()
getsamplerate()
nothing more.... (it should call the createbuffers() function)

I don't know why foobar stop here the communication with the driver. I also
took a look to the ASIO DSK, and it seems everything is ok in the
JackRouter driver implementation, in my mind the problem is not about
JackRouter but about the foobar additionnal component that allows to use
ASIO drivers.

So I got a fast looking on how to build a foobar component (to try to build
a component especially for using the JackRouter driver), because the ASIO
component is not open source, but I get compilation errors about symbols
and/or linkings and I don't really know how to solve them.

Furthermore, revolving the foobar problem wouldn't be enough for me as I
NEED to make the driver work for at least one measurement software
(preferably HolmImpulse, but Room EQ Wizard would also make the trick).

I found an ASIO plugin for windows media player but couldn't make it work,
is it a fake ?!?

You can send WMP to VAC and then set VAC as the input device in Jack

Well I thought VAC was running an internal clock ? How can it be
synchronised with the sound card sampling rate ?



I am know trying to learn how to build a kernel driver, to try to make a
virtual driver as VAC, but connected to jack server as a client and
transfering data at the same rate as the jack server (so synchronised with
my soundcard).

I downloaded samples about miniaudio drivers, but after comiling them I get
a .sys file, and I don't really know what to do about it. I tried SrvMan
(service manager) to create a service using the .sys file, but when I try
to start the service I get an error that the driver has been blocked and
couldn't be launch.

So I am now trying to use VisualDDK, but I have to create a VirtualMachine
for deployment test, and go back from VStudio 2012-2013 to Vstudio 2010 as
earlier versions are not compatible with VisualDDK.

If someone here is experienced building and testing driver a little help
would be very appreciable for me ;)
