Subject:     [Jack-Devel] driver_null_cycle

Hi there,

Can someone please clarify the driver_null_cycle function for me ?

The function is defined as so :
static int you_driver_null_cycle (you_driver_t *driver, jack_nframes_t 
nframes);

My question is w.r.t. the nframes. Is this function meant to flush 
nframes from the audio stream ?

Here is what is written in include/driver.h
    The JACK engine will call this after the wait function (above) has
    been called, but for some reason the engine is unable to execute
    a full "cycle". the driver should do whatever is necessary to
    keep itself running correctly, but cannot reference ports
    or other JACK data structures in any way.

thanks
Matt
