Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] driver_null_cycle

I think I understand what the driver_wait function is doing ...
It appears that the driver_wait function is trying to work out how much 
time has passed since the last transport_cycle_start and if it has taken 
too long, then it reports an error.

But the null_cycle is still confusing.
