I've been trying to fix some audio drop outs issues with Jack and Pure Data
on Ubuntu but couldn't fix it (I had started a thread with the 'was:'
subject) so now I'm giving Sabayon 14.01 a try. Typing $ jackd -dfirewire I
get the following:
jackd 0.121.3

JACK compiled with System V SHM support.
loading driver ..
libffado 2.0.1-Unversioned directory built Dec 28 2012 19:54:13
firewire ERR: Could not start streaming threads: -1
DRIVER NT: could not start driver
cannot start driver
no message buffer overruns

It's a bit strange as two days ago jack was opening, the 'working
indication' LED on my sound card was turning blue (which is a 'working'
indication) but jack would complain that it couldn't allocate memory, even
though in /etc/security/limits.d there's a "40-realtime-base.conf" file
which includes the following lines:
@realtime   -   rtprio    99
@realtime   -   memlock unlimited

I also tried to compile Jack2 (after I compiled waf) and got a fatal error
during build:
In file included from ../common/JackNetTool.cpp:20:0:
../common/JackNetTool.h:412:30: fatal error: opus/opus_custom.h: No such
file or directory
compilation terminated.

As far as I understand there's a header file missing. Googling it I found
some stuff, but understood that this header file is using other header
files etc. and I'm getting a bit lost here. Any advice on which files to
add to which places?
