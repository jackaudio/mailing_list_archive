&gt; I've been trying to fix some audio drop outs issues with Jack and Pure Data
&gt; on Ubuntu but couldn't fix it (I had started a thread with the 'was:'
&gt; subject) so now I'm giving Sabayon 14.01 a try. Typing $ jackd -dfirewire I
&gt; get the following:
&gt; jackd 0.121.3
&gt; :
&gt; libffado 2.0.1-Unversioned directory built Dec 28 2012 19:54:13

This is now a very old version of FFADO.  Our latest release is version
2.1.  There are a great many changes between 2.0.1 and 2.1.  Assuming there
is a problem with FFADO (and that's not immediately clear), an update to 2.1
will be required before any progress can be made.

&gt; firewire ERR: Could not start streaming threads: -1

The FFADO driver was unable to start for some reason.  Please try running

  jackd -dfirewire -v6

and see if this gives any additional output.  If not it means your FFADO was
not compiled with debug enabled.  Refer to the previous discussion about
this.

&gt; It's a bit strange as two days ago jack was opening, the 'working
&gt; indication' LED on my sound card was turning blue (which is a 'working'
&gt; indication) but jack would complain that it couldn't allocate memory, even
&gt; though in /etc/security/limits.d there's a "40-realtime-base.conf" file
&gt; which includes the following lines:
&gt; @realtime   -   rtprio    99
&gt; @realtime   -   memlock unlimited

I can't comment on memory allocation failures reported by jackd.  The jackd
list would need to see the actual messages to make any sense of that.

&gt; I also tried to compile Jack2 (after I compiled waf) and got a fatal error
&gt; during build:
&gt; In file included from ../common/JackNetTool.cpp:20:0:
&gt; ../common/JackNetTool.h:412:30: fatal error: opus/opus_custom.h: No such
&gt; file or directory
&gt; compilation terminated.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I understand there's a header file missing. Googling it I found
&gt; some stuff, but understood that this header file is using other header
&gt; files etc. and I'm getting a bit lost here. Any advice on which files to
&gt; add to which places?

At a very rough guess I'd say you need the devel package of the opus
library.  Most distributions include this in their package management
system.
