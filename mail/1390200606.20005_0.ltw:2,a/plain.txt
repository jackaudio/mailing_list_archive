This is now a very old version of FFADO.  Our latest release is version
2.1.  There are a great many changes between 2.0.1 and 2.1.  Assuming there
is a problem with FFADO (and that's not immediately clear), an update to 2.1
will be required before any progress can be made.

The FFADO driver was unable to start for some reason.  Please try running

  jackd -dfirewire -v6

and see if this gives any additional output.  If not it means your FFADO was
not compiled with debug enabled.  Refer to the previous discussion about
this.

I can't comment on memory allocation failures reported by jackd.  The jackd
list would need to see the actual messages to make any sense of that.

At a very rough guess I'd say you need the devel package of the opus
library.  Most distributions include this in their package management
system.
