Just confirming that I also see a similar xrun when running the alsa 
driver ... see below ...
It is possible that this problem is within Jack itself, and not the 
drivers ...

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; I have added a new IIO driver to jack.
&gt; IIO is Industrial IO and it is for devices with high sample rates.
&gt; Currently it is only partially tested with devices which have the 
&gt; AD7476A chips onboard - they have a 1MHz sample rate which is rather 
&gt; nice :) However I have a problem ... please read on ...
&gt;
&gt; As I don't have write access to the original jack1 repo, I have forked 
&gt; until I do. For now you can find it here :
&gt; https://github.com/flatmax/jack1
&gt;
&gt; You will also need the git repo for gtkiostream, as it uses this code :
&gt; http://www.flatmax.org/gtkiostream/html/classIIO.html
&gt;
&gt; This new IIO driver is in alpha mode... I am currently testing on an 
&gt; ARM board however I get large overruns for some reason ...
&gt;
&gt; Here is an example when running 'jackd -r -d iio' :
&gt;
&gt; created iio driver ... iio_pcm|1000000|1024|1024|4|0
&gt; iio_driver_start::   enabling IIO : enable(true)
&gt; iio_driver_wait
&gt; iio_driver_wait
&gt; **** iio: xrun of 97145 usec
&gt; iio_driver_wait
&gt; **** iio: xrun of 81626 usec
&gt; iio_driver_wait
&gt; **** iio: xrun of 80022 usec
&gt; iio_driver_wait
&gt; **** iio: xrun of 79894 usec
&gt; iio_driver_wait
&gt; **** iio: xrun of 79856 usec
&gt; iio_driver_wait
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am actually wondering whether anyone can help me with some information ?
&gt; I run the driver with zero load ... it doesn't ever try to read 
&gt; anything from the actual devices ... however it appears that jack on 
&gt; the ARM board is giving Xruns of the order of 80 ms !
&gt;
&gt; This is even when the driver_read function is as follows :
&gt; static int iio_driver_read (iio_driver_t *driver, jack_nframes_t 
&gt; nframes) {
&gt;   return 0;
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; The relevant driver code is located here :
&gt; https://github.com/flatmax/jack1/blob/master/drivers/iio/iio_driver.C
&gt;
&gt; It uses the g++ compiler because it instantiates the IIO class from 
&gt; gtkiostream to do the heavy lifting.
