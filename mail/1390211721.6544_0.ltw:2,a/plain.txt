In-Reply-To: Matt Flax [Jack-Devel] new IIO driver added to jack - large overruns (1390210559.4511_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] new IIO driver added to jack - large overruns

Just confirming that I also see a similar xrun when running the alsa 
driver ... see below ...
It is possible that this problem is within Jack itself, and not the 
drivers ...
