OK, thanks.

I am now compiling with different flags on the ARM (let me know if you 
need them) ... and I have removed this xrun problem from the ALSA 
driver. I have also drastically reduced the xrun problem in the iio 
driver to about 0.3 ms. The xruns occur about every 43 ms. This result 
occurs when I sample 4 channels at 1 MHz.
If I only sample 2 channels I find I get xruns of about 0.15 ms. This 
occurs roughly every 67 ms.

By the way - in a similar manner to jack2 - I find I need to remove the 
POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE for the ARM architecture... otherwise I get the 
expected "Bus error" ... hmmm.

I am wondering what I should do to squeeze the tiny 0.3 ms speed up !

If you want to help, then you can pull the gtkiostream and flatmax/jack1 
repos. thanks

Here is an example run :

# jackd -R -d iio -p2048

created iio driver ... iio_pcm|1000000|2048|2048|4|0

&gt;     Just confirming that I also see a similar xrun when running the
&gt;     alsa driver ... see below ...
&gt;     It is possible that this problem is within Jack itself, and not
&gt;     the drivers ...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; xruns are caused by systemic problems or by clients, not by JACK itself.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.259 msecs
&gt;
&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.001 msecs
&gt;
&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.038 msecs
&gt;
&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.019 msecs
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; the consistency of the timing strongly suggests a systemic cause 
&gt; (there are many possible such causes)
