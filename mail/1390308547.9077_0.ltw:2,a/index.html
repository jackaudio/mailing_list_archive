I have found that jack isn't pulling much cpu time at all when operating 
the iio driver. Top reports that it chews about 3% of the cpu power. 
This suggests that a lot of the delay is coming from kernel related 
servicing of the iio read calls.

The small overruns can probably be removed by reading from the DMA 
buffer in the background, but I would need to do some form of locking 
and unlocking ... whether it be polling in user space or some atomic 
lock system ...
Does anyone have suggestions on what can be used for locking or user 
space polling - something approved by jack ?
Also it may be a good idea to have separate reading threads ... one for 
each IIO device ... any pointers ?

&gt; I am now compiling with different flags on the ARM (let me know if you 
&gt; need them) ... and I have removed this xrun problem from the ALSA 
&gt; driver. I have also drastically reduced the xrun problem in the iio 
&gt; driver to about 0.3 ms. The xruns occur about every 43 ms. This result 
&gt; occurs when I sample 4 channels at 1 MHz.
&gt; If I only sample 2 channels I find I get xruns of about 0.15 ms. This 
&gt; occurs roughly every 67 ms.
&gt;
&gt; By the way - in a similar manner to jack2 - I find I need to remove 
&gt; the POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE for the ARM architecture... otherwise I get 
&gt; the expected "Bus error" ... hmmm.
&gt;
&gt; I am wondering what I should do to squeeze the tiny 0.3 ms speed up !
&gt;
&gt; If you want to help, then you can pull the gtkiostream and 
&gt; flatmax/jack1 repos. thanks
&gt;
&gt; Here is an example run :
&gt;
&gt; # jackd -R -d iio -p2048
&gt;
&gt; created iio driver ... iio_pcm|1000000|2048|2048|4|0

&gt;&gt;     Just confirming that I also see a similar xrun when running the
&gt;&gt;     alsa driver ... see below ...
&gt;&gt;     It is possible that this problem is within Jack itself, and not
&gt;&gt;     the drivers ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; xruns are caused by systemic problems or by clients, not by JACK itself.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.259 msecs
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.001 msecs
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.038 msecs
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 71.019 msecs
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; the consistency of the timing strongly suggests a systemic cause 
&gt;&gt; (there are many possible such causes)
