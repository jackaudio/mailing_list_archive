Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] new IIO driver added to jack - large overruns

I have found that jack isn't pulling much cpu time at all when operating 
the iio driver. Top reports that it chews about 3% of the cpu power. 
This suggests that a lot of the delay is coming from kernel related 
servicing of the iio read calls.

The small overruns can probably be removed by reading from the DMA 
buffer in the background, but I would need to do some form of locking 
and unlocking ... whether it be polling in user space or some atomic 
lock system ...
Does anyone have suggestions on what can be used for locking or user 
space polling - something approved by jack ?
Also it may be a good idea to have separate reading threads ... one for 
each IIO device ... any pointers ?

Matt
