&gt; So as a general advice, here's what you can do:
&gt; 
&gt;    1.) Have a look at some PCI ALSA drivers and/or read the ALSA driver
&gt;        tutorial. Even if you really don't want to write an ALSA driver,
&gt;        you'll at least understand the basic approach taken in jackd.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    2.) If you're dealing with a userspace driver, maybe have a look at
&gt;        FFADO and its jackd integration. Note that the FFADO project has
&gt;        shown that you really want kernel-level streaming, so userspace
&gt;        drivers are generally more headache than necessary.

Plus reading this book:

	http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/

for the basics about writing Linux kernel drivers in general. It is a bit 
outdated (i.e. various kernel internal APIs have changed, USB drivers are 
rather written in user space nowadays, ...), but shows you the minimum 
principles dealing with the Linux kernel internals. Without that knowledge, it 
will be hard. Especially since the Linux kernel sources themselves do not have 
many comments.
