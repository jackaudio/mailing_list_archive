Plus reading this book:

	http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/

for the basics about writing Linux kernel drivers in general. It is a bit 
outdated (i.e. various kernel internal APIs have changed, USB drivers are 
rather written in user space nowadays, ...), but shows you the minimum 
principles dealing with the Linux kernel internals. Without that knowledge, it 
will be hard. Especially since the Linux kernel sources themselves do not have 
many comments.
