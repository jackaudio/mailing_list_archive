Thanks for the suggestions...

&gt;&gt; I have found that jack isn't pulling much cpu time at all when
&gt;&gt; operating the iio driver. Top reports that it chews about 3% of the
&gt;&gt; cpu power. This suggests that a lot of the delay is coming from
&gt;&gt; kernel related servicing of the iio read calls.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The small overruns can probably be removed by reading from the DMA
&gt;&gt; buffer in the background, but I would need to do some form of
&gt;&gt; locking and unlocking ... whether it be polling in user space or
&gt;&gt; some atomic lock system ...
&gt; The usual approach is to be woken up from the kernel whenever some parts
&gt; of the buffer (let's say one half for a start) are ready for processing.
&gt;
&gt; This doesn't require locking. Thing is, it's a bit hard to give useful
&gt; hints, since you're developing an entirely new driver, that is, only you
&gt; know the details.
&gt;
&gt; So as a general advice, here's what you can do:
&gt;
&gt;     1.) Have a look at some PCI ALSA drivers and/or read the ALSA driver
&gt;         tutorial. Even if you really don't want to write an ALSA driver,
&gt;         you'll at least understand the basic approach taken in jackd.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     2.) If you're dealing with a userspace driver, maybe have a look at
&gt;         FFADO and its jackd integration. Note that the FFADO project has
&gt;         shown that you really want kernel-level streaming, so userspace
&gt;         drivers are generally more headache than necessary.
I have been referencing all drivers for information and ideas ... it has 
been very helpful.
Bare in mind that IIO is already implemented using DMA into kernel 
memory space. There is a driver which streams all of the samples over 
/dev/iio:device0, /dev/iio:device1 and so on.

&gt;     3.) Take a shortcut and hire Paul Davis, Clemens Ladisch or Daniel
&gt;         Mack. No idea if any of these guys is available for freelancing
&gt;         at the moment. They know Linux audio inside out and hence know
&gt;         how to do it right.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don't know your hardware at hand, but unless you have very good
&gt; reason, I strongly encourage you to write an ALSA driver. This way, your
&gt; audio device would automatically work with jack1 AND jack2, so no need
&gt; for porting.
Yep - that was my first thought, however as there is already a nice iio 
driver with ring buffers and so on, the thought is to simply use them.

&gt;
&gt; Just my &#x20AC;0.02
