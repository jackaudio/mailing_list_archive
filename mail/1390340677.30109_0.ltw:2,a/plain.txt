That is a good question. All of the devices stream directly into memory 
using DMA, so my understanding is that there is very little CPU 
interaction at that point. Something must be going on in the IIO 
subsystem to manage the ring buffer, but most likely very little. As the 
CPU appears to be loaded by only 3%, I would say that something else is 
experiencing a bottleneck ... hopefully Christian's suggestion to 
inspect using OProfile will shed some light on what is causing this 
bottleneck.

Yes, I understand this point. The problem with these IIO devices is that 
if I increase the size of the ring buffer, and thus am able to increase 
the period size, the xruns actually get worse ! It doesn't seem right to 
me, but that’s what is happening. I have tuned the period size to their 
minimum xrun state.
