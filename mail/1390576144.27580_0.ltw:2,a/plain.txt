Yes.

Well, it is hard to say, latency depends on platform limitation or hw spec.
for example, android's fast mixer introduces 10ms of latency.

Generally, mobile devices do control power consumption much sensitive
than PC, of course this limitation may possible occur XRUNS in some
scenarios.
We always think how to improve performance better, *** so I need
expert's advice here. ***
But, modern mobile devices increase number of cores(quad-core or
more...), so I guess JACK2 works better performance along with number
of cores. Of course, it works stable if allows reasonable clock-speed
and cores.
