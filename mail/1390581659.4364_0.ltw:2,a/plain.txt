Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] JACK2 for Android newly released!

I have not had an opportunity to look at the new release, but I did attend
the presentation at the San Francisco developers conference in October
2013. I have released an app based on their JACK-based pro audio framework.
I believe it was the first 3rd party app. (
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueverdi.myruckus) .

At the developers conference Samsung stated the pro audio framework was
supported only on Note 3 and Galaxy Tab 10.1 2014. My experience is on Note
3.

First, the framework only supported I/O via built-in audio devices. No USB.
This means audio quality is compromised by their audio hardware.
Importantly, they are restricted to 48k/16 bit.

Second, per their conference presentation they are running with two 512
sample buffers. At 48k this misses the mark for low latency. Even at that
level of latency I saw significant xruns. Using only their example simple
client - which generates a stereo sine wave from a table -  I heard
numerous audio artifacts. Logcat output showed 29 xruns in a two minute
test. This was completely reproducible. I reported this on their developer
forum on Jan 2 and as of today there has been no Samsung response.

In the interests of full disclosure I have ported JACK to Android myself.
The  project is on hold due to the Samsung release, in spite of better
performance.
