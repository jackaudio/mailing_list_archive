&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have not had an opportunity to look at the new release, but I did
&gt; &gt; attend the presentation at the San Francisco developers conference
&gt; &gt; in October 2013. I have released an app based on their JACK-based
&gt; &gt; pro audio framework. I believe it was the first 3rd party app.
&gt; &gt; (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueverdi.myruckus) . 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At the developers conference Samsung stated the pro audio framework
&gt; &gt; was supported only on Note 3 and Galaxy Tab 10.1 2014. My
&gt; &gt; experience is on Note 3.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First, the framework only supported I/O via built-in audio devices.
&gt; &gt; No USB. This means audio quality is compromised by their audio
&gt; &gt; hardware. Importantly, they are restricted to 48k/16 bit.
&gt; Yes, it is true, but most of things are platform dependent. Not a
&gt; jack domain.
On the long run, do you know if Samsung have plans to use processors
with with different kind of cores into their devices? As example, a low
power low frequency core for the standby, a dedicated core for the
hardware, a general core for the GUI, and a DSP core for the
calculations. DSP algorithms are very effective, and that could be a
very effective way to solve that kind of issue.

Of course, that would imply to adapt the compilers as well, and the
code of the programs for the compiler to know which part of code is
for which core.

Thanks,
Dominique
