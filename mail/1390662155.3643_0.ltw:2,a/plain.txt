On the long run, do you know if Samsung have plans to use processors
with with different kind of cores into their devices? As example, a low
power low frequency core for the standby, a dedicated core for the
hardware, a general core for the GUI, and a DSP core for the
calculations. DSP algorithms are very effective, and that could be a
very effective way to solve that kind of issue.

Of course, that would imply to adapt the compilers as well, and the
code of the programs for the compiler to know which part of code is
for which core.

Thanks,
Dominique
