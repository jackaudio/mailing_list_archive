HI,

 

I am using Jack audio connection kit in order to realize my virtual organ
setup.

 

I am using the following software for this organ setup:

1.       jOrgan ver 3.20

2.       Fluidsynth extension to jOrgan, to host the various soundfonts that
I am using in my setup - about 50 soundfonts, some big and some small.

3.       Tobybear Minihost Ver 1.64 to host all the vsti instruments and vst
effects mentioned below:

4.       Freeverb vst effect

5.       Mr Donald vst effect

6.       A couple of vsti instruments.

7.       Asio4All

 

I am also using hardware skound generation systems, e.g. Yamaha psr 295 X 2
keyboards.

 

 

When I start the system, I start it in this order.

1.       Turn on computer, which also loads Asio4All.

2.       Turn on all mdi equipment

3.       Jack Audio Connection Kit

4.       All VST instruments and effects

5.       jOrgan, which loads all the soundfonts and the whold midi
configuration.

At this point I can see all the connections being made in Jack Connections
Window, as the soundfonts are loaded one by one. The connections to the
'writeable clients/input ports are made now automatically.

6.       However, these connections are not done correctly, so I have to
break all the connections and redo them all manually.

 

At this point, I can start playing my virtual organ setup.

 

But using so many soundfonts and vst instruments and effects, it is a
tedious job to manually make all the connections every time I start up the
system.

 

Then I was told to use 'Patchbay' instead of 'Connect'.

 

I did this and set up all the connections in Patchbay, saved everything, and
activated Patchbay persistence.

 

But it is not working.  When I start up everything, the connections are
still being made in "connect", even though the configuration is 'activated'
in Patchbay.

 

Is this a bug, or am I missing something.

 

Any advice will be highly appreciated.

 

Regards,

Brian 

South Africa.
