Subject:     [Jack-Devel] libopus: or compile w/o netjack2?

I'm a newbie, and trying to compile jack-1.9.9.5. 
<Linux waterboy 3.2.0-49-powerpc64-smp ubuntu 12.04, opus-1.1> 

$ ./waf build --dbus --firewire --alsa --debug \
  --enable-pkg-config-dbus-service-dir --libdir=/usr/local/lib 

... fails because libopus.so doesn't support the 'custom' calls.

<Note: The README and --help do not say whether the --dbus, etc 
parameters need be passed past the configuration stage, but the compiler
doesn't complain.>

After reviewing archives, i THINK I understand that only jacknet requires the
'custom' calls in libopus. I found a copy of opus_custom.h on the net;
and added it to the libopus.so compile, which worked around this complaint:

   [233/267] cprogram: build/example-clients/midi_latency_test.c.5.o -> build/example-clients/jack_midi_latency_test
   common/libjackserver.so: undefined reference to `opus_custom_mode_create'
   common/libjackserver.so: undefined reference to `opus_custom_encode_float'
   common/libjackserver.so: undefined reference to `opus_custom_decoder_destroy'
   common/libjackserver.so: undefined reference to `opus_custom_encoder_destroy'
   ...
   collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

... but the installed jackdbus continually dumps core anytime a client <qjackctl, in
my setup> calls it. the resulting "jack_control start" seems to work, however, reporting
3 'no xruns' lines, and waiting for a client. So <perhaps> I'm close to something that
could work. Maybe.

Is there a workaround for the lack of 'blessed' opus_custom.h calls? Apparently, from the archives,
I need to change some opus sources, for which there is no SVN ... Would it work to suppress
the compilation of jacknet? I don't intend to use it. Is there an easy way to pass the
suppression parameter, or must I edit the waf config files?

thanks.
