Hi,


Part of Brian's problem is that jOrgan-Fluidsynth will automatically connect Jack channels as it loads a soundfont, and most VST hosts will do the same with JackRouter connections. Patch bay will restore connections, but it won't remove those that are already made.&#xA0;




Is there a Jack Control method for removing all connections and then activating a patch bay configuration. Or a JACK command that can be used in a batch file to disconnect these connections?




Kind regards,

GrahamG

&gt; HI,
&gt;  
&gt; I am using Jack audio connection kit in order to realize my virtual organ
&gt; setup.
&gt;  
&gt; I am using the following software for this organ setup:
&gt; 1.       jOrgan ver 3.20
&gt; 2.       Fluidsynth extension to jOrgan, to host the various soundfonts that
&gt; I am using in my setup - about 50 soundfonts, some big and some small.
&gt; 3.       Tobybear Minihost Ver 1.64 to host all the vsti instruments and vst
&gt; effects mentioned below:
&gt; 4.       Freeverb vst effect
&gt; 5.       Mr Donald vst effect
&gt; 6.       A couple of vsti instruments.
&gt; 7.       Asio4All
&gt;  
&gt; I am also using hardware skound generation systems, e.g. Yamaha psr 295 X 2
&gt; keyboards.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; When I start the system, I start it in this order.
&gt; 1.       Turn on computer, which also loads Asio4All.
&gt; 2.       Turn on all mdi equipment
&gt; 3.       Jack Audio Connection Kit
&gt; 4.       All VST instruments and effects
&gt; 5.       jOrgan, which loads all the soundfonts and the whold midi
&gt; configuration.
&gt; At this point I can see all the connections being made in Jack Connections
&gt; Window, as the soundfonts are loaded one by one. The connections to the
&gt; 'writeable clients/input ports are made now automatically.
&gt; 6.       However, these connections are not done correctly, so I have to
&gt; break all the connections and redo them all manually.
&gt;  
&gt; At this point, I can start playing my virtual organ setup.
&gt;  
&gt; But using so many soundfonts and vst instruments and effects, it is a
&gt; tedious job to manually make all the connections every time I start up the
&gt; system.
&gt;  
&gt; Then I was told to use 'Patchbay' instead of 'Connect'.
&gt;  
&gt; I did this and set up all the connections in Patchbay, saved everything, and
&gt; activated Patchbay persistence.
&gt;  
&gt; But it is not working.  When I start up everything, the connections are
&gt; still being made in "connect", even though the configuration is 'activated'
&gt; in Patchbay.
&gt;  
&gt; Is this a bug, or am I missing something.
&gt;  
&gt; Any advice will be highly appreciated.
&gt;  
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Brian 
&gt; South Africa.
