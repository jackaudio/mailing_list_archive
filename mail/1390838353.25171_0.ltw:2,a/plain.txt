What do you mean with "platform dependent"? External USB audio devices usually 
support the "USB audio class" standard protocol nowadays. Support for such 
devices is provided by a standard Linux kernel module which is platform 
independent.

Yes, CPU scaling (CPUFreq) is one of the major reasons for xruns. You could 
first try whether this is the case by:

	cpufreq-set -r -g performance

to find out whether that is sufficient to solve the xruns. That would set the 
CPU cores to maximum performance. If that looks well, you could then go ahead 
with a production solution like i.e. jackfreqd or something based on that idea 
to both save power whenever possible and not having xruns in audio 
performances.

I don't know what kind of hardware components you are using exactly, but I 
somehow doubt that latency issues are caused by your hardware. iOS devices 
deliver rock solid low latency from day one (for more than 6 years now). And 
there are various other ARM based hardware on the market which also deliver 
reliable low latency if being equipped with the right OS & co.

Are you running a hypervisor kernel like OKL4 on lowest level and 
Android/Linux on top of it? Or is the Android/Linux kernel running directly on 
the ARM CPU?
