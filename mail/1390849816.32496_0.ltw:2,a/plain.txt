Hi all,

The Linux Audio Conference submissions deadline has been extended! It is
now February 3rd, 2014 (23:59 HAST)

So, if you were considering to submit a paper but couldn't make up your
mind yet, here is your chance to become active! Never forget that this
conference lives through the people participating in it.

February 3rd is the new deadline for all submission types: papers,
music, installations, workshop proposals.

Check out the link below for more info:

Please spread this information to anyone who might be interested.
If you have any questions, drop us a line at [hidden]

We are looking forward to seeing you in Karlsruhe in May!
Thanks,

The LAC2014 organization team
