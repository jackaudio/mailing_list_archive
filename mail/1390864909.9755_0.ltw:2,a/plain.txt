Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] libopus: or compile w/o netjack2?

Hi Frank,

For Jack to be able to use Opus, it has to have custom modes enabled. If
Jack is detecting it, than at least part of Opus is installed. You
should make sure you know where it is, and then install Opus from source
over the top of it. When you configure it, you just need to add
--enable-custom-modes and Jack will be able to work with it.
