&gt; &gt; &gt; First, the framework only supported I/O via built-in audio devices. No

&gt; &gt; &gt; Importantly, they are restricted to 48k/16 bit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, it is true, but most of things are platform dependent. Not a jack
&gt; &gt; domain.
&gt;
&gt; What do you mean with "platform dependent"? External USB audio devices
usually
&gt; support the "USB audio class" standard protocol nowadays. Support for such
&gt; devices is provided by a standard Linux kernel module which is platform
&gt; independent.
Yes. android officially support USB Audio by framework level.
But, how to JACK access and use /dev/usb/... as audio device using jack
driver?
I have no background about that.
Are there any bridge between usb~alsa?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I think these XRUNS related cpufreq on demand governor when a jack
client
&gt; &gt; runs during low CPU frequency mode in mobile device. Please refer:
&gt; &gt;
http://bamboopuppy.com/android-cpu-frequency-using-cpufreq-ondemand-governo
&gt; &gt; r/ As I know, there were already discussion in here, so I found Robin's
&gt; &gt; jackfreqd, How do you think for solution?
&gt; &gt; http://rg42.org/oss/jackfreqd/start
&gt;
&gt; Yes, CPU scaling (CPUFreq) is one of the major reasons for xruns. You
could
&gt; first try whether this is the case by:
&gt;
&gt;         cpufreq-set -r -g performance
&gt;
&gt; to find out whether that is sufficient to solve the xruns. That would set
the
&gt; CPU cores to maximum performance. If that looks well, you could then go
ahead
&gt; with a production solution like i.e. jackfreqd or something based on that
idea
&gt; to both save power whenever possible and not having xruns in audio
&gt; performances.
Ok. Thanks.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What about low latency/RT stabilty, have you tested running JACK2
with
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; low latency period settings (i.e. &lt;= 5ms) on Android? Does it run
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; quite stable without xruns?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Well, it is hard to say, latency depends on platform limitation or hw
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; spec. for example, android's fast mixer introduces 10ms of latency.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; http://source.android.com/devices/latency_design.html
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Generally, mobile devices do control power consumption much sensitive
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; than PC, of course this limitation may possible occur XRUNS in some
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; scenarios.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; We always think how to improve performance better, *** so I need
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; expert's advice here. ***
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; But, modern mobile devices increase number of cores(quad-core or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more...), so I guess JACK2 works better performance along with number
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of cores. Of course, it works stable if allows reasonable clock-speed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and cores.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know what kind of hardware components you are using exactly, but I
&gt; somehow doubt that latency issues are caused by your hardware. iOS devices
&gt; deliver rock solid low latency from day one (for more than 6 years now).
And
&gt; there are various other ARM based hardware on the market which also
deliver
&gt; reliable low latency if being equipped with the right OS &amp; co.
&gt;
&gt; Are you running a hypervisor kernel like OKL4 on lowest level and
&gt; Android/Linux on top of it? Or is the Android/Linux kernel running
directly on
&gt; the ARM CPU?
I have no idea about hypervisor or something.

&gt;
