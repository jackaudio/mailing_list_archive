modprobe does not exist in any version of Android I have looked at. Google
is fond of monolithic kernels.

Likewise with aplay or any other ALSA utilities. However, you can mine
/proc/asound for information, at least on Nexus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; support the "USB audio class" standard protocol nowadays. Support for

&gt; &gt; Yes. android officially support USB Audio by framework level.
&gt; &gt; But, how to JACK access and use /dev/usb/... as audio device using jack
&gt; &gt; driver?
&gt; &gt; I have no background about that.
&gt; &gt; Are there any bridge between usb~alsa?
&gt;
&gt; Like already suggested by Patrick, you need the ALSA USB audio kernel
&gt; module
&gt; (modprobe snd-usb-audio), which already comes with the official Linux
&gt; kernel.
&gt; The driver module file should be at a location like:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; /lib/modules/KERNEL_NAME_AND_VERSION/kernel/sound/usb/snd-usb-audio.ko
&gt;
&gt; By the way, devices under /dev/usb are just shown if there is a compatible
&gt; driver available &amp; loaded on the system. Otherwise the USB device will
&gt; never
&gt; appear under /dev/usb at all.
&gt;
&gt; Once you loaded the kernel module, check whether the USB audio device is
&gt; visible in the ALSA system, i.e with
&gt;
&gt;         aplay -l
&gt;
&gt; if yes, you can use i.e. "aplay -D DEVICENAME /foo/some.wav" to output some
&gt; sound file to the USB audio device.
&gt;
&gt; If you do not have that kernel module and are not permitted to add it to
&gt; the
&gt; Android release, you might solve it in user space. But that would mean
&gt; quite
&gt; some work: Since around kernel 2.6.2x there is something called "USB file
&gt; system" (usbfs). If that is enabled in your kernel configuration, then
&gt; every
&gt; USB device attached will automatically appear under /proc/bus/usb/, that
&gt; is no
&gt; matter whether there is a driver for it or not. usbfs allows to communicate
&gt; with USB devices in user space, by simply conveniently opening their "USB
&gt; endpoint" file under /proc/bus/usb/ and reading/writing to it by a normal
&gt; application. However you might then need to write such an application on
&gt; your
&gt; own, by looking at what snd-usb-audio for example does or by reading the
&gt; "USB
&gt; audio class" protocol definition, since I am not aware of some
&gt; daemon/application ready to be used for that purpose.
&gt;
&gt; If you solved that, you have the next problem: the JACK server is usually
&gt; started with exactly one audio device. JACK2 has a slave driver concept,
&gt; however I can't remember the details about it right now. Maybe St&#xE9;phane or
&gt; somebody can comment it. I guess you would need to restart the JACK server
&gt; each time a USB audio device was attached or detached, supplying the USB
&gt; device(s) as slave device(s) at command line. Maybe you could also control
&gt; that at runtime by dealing with JACK2's driver API.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you running a hypervisor kernel like OKL4 on lowest level and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Android/Linux on top of it? Or is the Android/Linux kernel running
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; directly on
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ARM CPU?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have no idea about hypervisor or something.
&gt;
&gt; Hypervisor kernels are often used on mobile devices on lowest level. They
&gt; are
&gt; acting as kind of virtual machine layer for the "actual" operating systems
&gt; running on top of the hypervisor kernel. This is usually done for two
&gt; purposes: a) it allows multiple OSs to run at the same time, i.e. one OS
&gt; for
&gt; controlling embedded communication components, and in parallel the actual
&gt; end
&gt; user advertised OS like Android or Symbian. Further it allows b) the same
&gt; OS
&gt; binaries to run on a variety of hardware without modifications, saving
&gt; development costs.
&gt;
&gt; So whether or not there is a hypervisor kernel running, could have a large
&gt; impact on the question whether you are actually able to run audio apps with
&gt; low latency at all. So you might talk to somebody responsible for kernel
&gt; level
&gt; issues there at Samsung to find out whether that is the case.
