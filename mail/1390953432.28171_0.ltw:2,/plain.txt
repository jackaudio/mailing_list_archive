Thanks, Adrian. I'll try and track that change. In the meantime, I've
made some minor progress. 

I've verified the DBUS registration of server, jack_control client, and its
exec'd child. All have ID's and report methods in the dbus logs.

I've tracked it <the lack of 'server started' signal BACK to dbus; and subsequent
error timeout> down to this snippet from common/JackControlAPI.cpp:

SERVER_EXPORT bool
jackctl_server_open(
    jackctl_server *server_ptr,
    jackctl_driver *driver_ptr)
{
    JSList * paramlist = NULL;
...
        server_ptr->engine = new JackServer(
            server_ptr->sync.b,
            server_ptr->temporary.b,
            server_ptr->client_timeout.i,
            server_ptr->realtime.b,
            server_ptr->realtime_priority.i,
            server_ptr->port_max.ui,
            server_ptr->verbose.b,
            (jack_timer_type_t)server_ptr->clock_source.ui,
            server_ptr->name.str)
... 
seems to execute.
<I just sprinkled some "jack_info()" outputs to jackdbus.log to see where it blew up.>
 
But when "coerced" into this ?function pointer?

        rc = server_ptr->engine->Open(driver_ptr->desc_ptr, paramlist);

a bus error dumps core before the calling function can complete, and return.

I'm not a programmer, but I'm guessing that the '->Open' might need to be
re-typed? The trouble <for my skill level> is that I cannot find the original
function prototype to see how its defined.
