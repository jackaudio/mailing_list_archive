Hi

What is the point of FFADO continuing to exist if these drivers are 
going to become part of ALSA ?


Cheers

&gt; HI,
&gt;
&gt; I'm a newbie for this project. I'm a ALSA/FFADO developer and currently
&gt; working for ALSA drivers of some firewire devices.
&gt;
&gt; [alsa-devel] [RFC v3] [PATCH 00/52] Enhancement for support of firewire
&gt; devices
&gt; http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2014-January/071820.html
&gt;
&gt; And call for testing in 'Linux Audio Devel':
&gt; [LAD] Call for testing (final): ALSA driver for some firewire devices
&gt; http://lists.linuxaudio.org/pipermail/linux-audio-dev/2014-January/034662.html
&gt;
&gt; The drivers have almost the same streaming functionality as FFADO has.
&gt; The drivers are for some devices so-called 'GenericAVC', based on
&gt; Fireworks/BeBoB/OXFORD.
&gt;
&gt; Currently they aren't going to be merged to upstream. i have some
&gt; discussion about adjustment between the new drivers and related projects.
&gt;
&gt; At first, to PulseAudio.
&gt;
&gt; [pulseaudio-discuss] 'Failed to find a working profile' for firewire
&gt; sound devices
&gt; http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pulseaudio-discuss/2014-January/019685.html
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Next, to FFADO.
&gt; http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=52D8EE54.1040500%40sakamocchi.jp&amp;forum_name=ffado-devel
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Finally, to JACK... I have no issue to JACK :p
&gt;
&gt; JACK is still a good friend to Firewire sound devices. But I inform
&gt; three points to you.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Daisy-caining
&gt; With FFADO backend, jackd can handle some firewire devices. But with
&gt; ALSA backend, jack can't. This rule is still applied to the new drivers.
&gt;
&gt; When users want to use several ALSA PCM devices for firewire sound
&gt; devices, they must write ALSA configuration with 'multi' plugin. See in
&gt; detail:
&gt; http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm_plugins.html#pcm_plugins_multi
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 2. conflict between ALSA/FFADO streaming functionality
&gt; Both starts streaming. But generally, one device can handle a pair of
&gt; streams (in and out).  So FFADO/ALSA can conflict for streaming.
&gt;
&gt; To prevent this, I post a patch to FFADO. If this patch is applied, when
&gt; at least one of connected firewire devices is streaming, jackd with
&gt; FFADO backend fails to start streaming.
&gt;
&gt; [FFADO-devel] Adjustment between FFADO/ALSA for Firewire drivers
&gt; http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=31856195
&gt;
&gt; Here I have to mention about MIDI functionality. When users use ALSA
&gt; MIDI functionality, the new drivers also start streaming because
&gt; firewire streaming includes both of PCM samples/MIDI messages.
&gt;
&gt; Some graphical JACK application such as 'patchage' displays ALSA MIDI
&gt; ports when jackd is running. But users can't do this. Vise versa, when
&gt; users use any ALSA MIDI ports, then jackd always failed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 3. control for internal mixer
&gt; The new drivers don't give this functionality. So users still need
&gt; applications for it, like FFADO Mixer.
&gt;
