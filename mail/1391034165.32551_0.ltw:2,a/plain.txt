While the firewire bus provides a synchronous bus clock (primarily used for
timing data transfers), very few firewire audio devices can make use of this
to derive an audio clock.  In a vast majority of cases, to achieve clock
sync two firewire interfaces on the same firewire bus still need to be
synced either via wordclock (best) or optical ports (the fallback in the
absence of wordclock I/O).
