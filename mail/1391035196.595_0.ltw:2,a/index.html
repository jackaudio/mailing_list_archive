Ah, I see. Thanks for the explanation. So does that distil down to : for 
full support of a device ALSA and FFADO will exist together. ALSA 
achieving the streaming and then FFADO looking after the user side of 
things. ie working together. Or could it be that a user could still make 
a decision to use either FFADO or ALSA ?

Cheers

Chris

&gt;&gt; What is the point of FFADO continuing to exist if these drivers are

&gt;
&gt; Several reasons.  Probably most importantly, the complex mixer and DSP
&gt; requirements of many of these devices mean it will be much easier and more
&gt; practical to maintain mixer functionality separately (there being no
&gt; technical requirement that device mixer/DSP control be in the kernel along
&gt; side the streaming code).  FFADO will exist to support this endeavour.
&gt; Secondly, at least during the transition time I expect FFADO to provide a
&gt; point of contact for users and developers of the firewire streaming code,
&gt; since it doesn't seem right that the ALSA lists be taken up with much of the
&gt; support issues which I expect to crop up.  We'll see how this pans out in
&gt; practice.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, while Takashi's work covers the streaming functionality of a number
&gt; of device families, others will continue to be supported via FFADO until
&gt; time permits a port of their streaming code into the kernel.  The most
&gt; significant of these are the RME and MOTU devices.  My plan is to work on
&gt; these during the course of this year now there is a functional streaming
&gt; driver I can use as a reference.  I am unable to give an ETA for this
&gt; at present though.
