Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] About ALSA drivers for Firewire sound devices

Ah, I see. Thanks for the explanation. So does that distil down to : for 
full support of a device ALSA and FFADO will exist together. ALSA 
achieving the streaming and then FFADO looking after the user side of 
things. ie working together. Or could it be that a user could still make 
a decision to use either FFADO or ALSA ?

Cheers

Chris
