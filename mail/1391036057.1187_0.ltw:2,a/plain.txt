Yes, this is the current expectation.

The transition period will be a bit messy for obvious reasons.  Even during
this time though it should settle down quite quickly once the existing ALSA
driver starts propagating into machines:
 - if a device is supported by the ALSA drivers, use that
 - otherwise use FFADO

There will also be an inevitable lag with the new drivers getting out to
people since most use distribution kernels, so I expect that testing of the
new kernel code will pick up once suitable kernels make their way into
distribution releases.
