I have built and installed a kernel with snd-usb-audio and snd-seq-midi
modules on my android device.

The modules reside in /system/vendor/modules/

You can add the following commands to your /init.rc file

insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-hwdep.ko
insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-rawmidi.ko
insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-seq.ko
insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-usb-audio.ko
insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-seq-device.ko
insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-seq-midi-event.ko
insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-seq-midi.ko
insmod /system/vendor/modules/snd-usbmidi-lib.ko

The order might need to be changed to load them correctly. They add an
additional 1.5MB to the system.img size on my device so that seems like a
reasonable price to pay.
