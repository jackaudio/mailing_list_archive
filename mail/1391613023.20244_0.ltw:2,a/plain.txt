Actual devices which my ALSA drivers support can handle one pair of 
in/out streams. Then PCM samples/MIDI messages are transferred on the 
same stream.

With my ALSA drivers, MIDI applications can start streaming to open MIDI 
character devices as PCM applications can start streaming to open PCM 
character devices.

So users can't simultaneously use ALSA MIDI ports and jackd with 
firewire backend.
