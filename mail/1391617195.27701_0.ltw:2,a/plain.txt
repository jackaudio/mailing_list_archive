My drivers don't support this type of synchronization: some devices in 
the same IEEE1394 bus, drivers decide a sync master from the devices 
then the others are sync slave, the drivers receive timestamp in packet 
from master and transmit the timestamp in the packet to the others.

And my drivers don't support this type of synchronization: some devices 
in the same IEEE1394 bus, drivers connects between them to transfer 
synchronization packets each other.

The reasons are:
1.I have never seen public specifications which describe this type of 
synchronizations.
2.I have never seen devices which support this type of synchronizations.

I guess that it was difficult for hardware vendors to implement this 
ideal synchronizations correctly, or sellers were not interested in.
