&gt; Some examples:

&gt; http://www.presonus.com/products/FireStudio-Project

Indeed - there are certainly devices out there which include "firewire sync"
in their specifications.  Their number is limited though and perhaps as a
result of this the implementation of this sync mode has never been included
in FFADO (there having been higher priority tasks to work on at the time). 
Furthermore, using wordclock (on devices equipped with it) will almost
certainly give a more reliable result.  Similar arguments possibly apply to
Takashi's ALSA streaming driver.

Takashi's point 1 may also play a part here.  I also haven't seen this sync
method described anywhere, but given that none of the devices I work with
include this feature I've never looked hard for it.  So it might be out
there.
