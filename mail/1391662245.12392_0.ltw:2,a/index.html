Paul and list,

I have now managed to get rid of xruns in my iio driver.

I find that I can pull (with no xruns) 4 channels @ 1 MHz with latencies 
as low as 0.75 ms ... amazing !
I am sure this figure will get worse, but it is a good starting point :)

I am starting by using the following for testing :
jackd -d iio -p 2048 -n 2

Which sets up a latency of about 4 ms.

I am now trying to connect using a client ... here is my problem...

On the driver function 'iio_driver_read'
     I can see the data coming in ... numbers range from 0. up to 4096.
     Should these be scaled down to be betwenn -1. and 1. ?

On the client :
   The process audio callback is receiving nothing from the iio driver. 
All samples read are = 0.

Any suggestions ideas ?

jack_lsp outputs the following :

# ./jack_lsp -p -t -A
system:capture_1
    iio_pcm:capture_1
     properties: output,physical,terminal,
     32 bit float mono audio
system:capture_2
    iio_pcm:capture_2
     properties: output,physical,terminal,
     32 bit float mono audio
system:capture_3
    iio_pcm:capture_3
     properties: output,physical,terminal,
     32 bit float mono audio
system:capture_4
    iio_pcm:capture_4
     properties: output,physical,terminal,
     32 bit float mono audio


Matt
p.s. I am still after someone to port this to jack2 ... any takers ?

&gt;&gt; If so:

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have found that jack isn't pulling much cpu time at all when
&gt;&gt;&gt; operating the iio driver. Top reports that it chews about 3% of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; cpu power. This suggests that a lot of the delay is coming from
&gt;&gt;&gt; kernel related servicing of the iio read calls.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The small overruns can probably be removed by reading from the DMA
&gt;&gt;&gt; buffer in the background, but I would need to do some form of
&gt;&gt;&gt; locking and unlocking ... whether it be polling in user space or
&gt;&gt;&gt; some atomic lock system ...
&gt;&gt; The usual approach is to be woken up from the kernel whenever some parts
&gt;&gt; of the buffer (let's say one half for a start) are ready for processing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This doesn't require locking. Thing is, it's a bit hard to give useful
&gt;&gt; hints, since you're developing an entirely new driver, that is, only you
&gt;&gt; know the details.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So as a general advice, here's what you can do:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     1.) Have a look at some PCI ALSA drivers and/or read the ALSA driver
&gt;&gt;         tutorial. Even if you really don't want to write an ALSA driver,
&gt;&gt;         you'll at least understand the basic approach taken in jackd.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     2.) If you're dealing with a userspace driver, maybe have a look at
&gt;&gt;         FFADO and its jackd integration. Note that the FFADO project has
&gt;&gt;         shown that you really want kernel-level streaming, so userspace
&gt;&gt;         drivers are generally more headache than necessary.
&gt; I have been referencing all drivers for information and ideas ... it 
&gt; has been very helpful.
&gt; Bare in mind that IIO is already implemented using DMA into kernel 
&gt; memory space. There is a driver which streams all of the samples over 
&gt; /dev/iio:device0, /dev/iio:device1 and so on.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     3.) Take a shortcut and hire Paul Davis, Clemens Ladisch or Daniel
&gt;&gt;         Mack. No idea if any of these guys is available for freelancing
&gt;&gt;         at the moment. They know Linux audio inside out and hence know
&gt;&gt;         how to do it right.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't know your hardware at hand, but unless you have very good
&gt;&gt; reason, I strongly encourage you to write an ALSA driver. This way, your
&gt;&gt; audio device would automatically work with jack1 AND jack2, so no need
&gt;&gt; for porting.
&gt; Yep - that was my first thought, however as there is already a nice 
&gt; iio driver with ring buffers and so on, the thought is to simply use 
&gt; them.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just my &#x20AC;0.02
