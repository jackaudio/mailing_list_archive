Subject:     [Jack-Devel] problems MIDI patchbay

I
am a beginner in this matter. I
am using Jack audio connection kit on Windows 8.1. While in audio
patchbay everything go fine, in MIDI patchbay doesn't appear no name
of application-client when I add a new plug-in, otherwise
from audio patchbay (where appear the name of the application)but only “System_midi”. I have added, following your
instructions, in Settings, in the field of server prefix the suffix:
<-X winmme>; the
drivers I use is “portaudio”. So,  if I try to connect for
instance the
system_midi output with the system_midi intput, sending Finale
playng a MIDI stream
to Pro Tools as recorder in a midi track, nothing happen.What
could I do?  
Thanks
niky
