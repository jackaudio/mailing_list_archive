I can't comment on the patchbay naming, sorry. As for routing, it sounds 
like you are trying to route a hardware midi out to a hardware midi in. 
That won't work.

You need virtual midi interfaces/cables [1][2]. LoopBe has a free 
version (1 input/output) and there is a version allowing, I believe, 30 
virtual cables.

I use LoopBe30, cost ~ 20 US $ / 17€ and works like a charm.

With all those unnamed cables, patches and routes, you will surely need 
a midi monitor of sorts [3]. This will help you diagnose missing 
connections, etc.
