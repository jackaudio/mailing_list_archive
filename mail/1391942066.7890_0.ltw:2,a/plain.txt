Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] problems MIDI patchbay

Hi Chad,

I would suggest that you don't use JACK Midi at all as it will only be
available for client software that has native support for JACK Midi
(Musescore, GrandOrgue, LinuxSampler, etc. but not Finale, Pro Tools,
etc.). In my experience, Windows MIDI drivers lock the MIDI interfaces
to the application that is using them, so configuring JACK with -X
winmme typically locks LoopBe or LoopMIDI ports to JACK and other
software then cannot access them.

So use JACK for Windows for your Audio (using the ASIO JackRouter) and
then LoopMIDI or LoopBe as your virtual MIDI cables between Finale and
Pro Tools.

Kind regards,
GrahamG
