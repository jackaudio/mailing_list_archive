Thanks to all and especially to GrahamG: now everithing is more clear; indeed LoopMidi and MidiOx work perfectly as virtual MIDI patchers: LoopMidi looks like to me very simple, MidiOx requires to understand is particular logic of connections, but have some more feature (monitoring MIDI ports etc.)Â 
Thanks
