It is very likely that you are the first one who ever tried such high rates 
with JACK. So nobody can tell you for certain whether there will be any 
problems. However as far as I can see it right now, as long as your period 
duration is reasonable high enough (i.e. > 1 ms), then I currently don't see a 
reason why it should not work reliably with JACK2.

Interesting test case though.
