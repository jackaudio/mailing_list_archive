&gt;&gt; So far I know that the driver side has no problem reading in many
&gt;&gt; channels without xruns ... what about the client side interacting with
&gt;&gt; that driver ?
&gt; It is very likely that you are the first one who ever tried such high rates
&gt; with JACK. So nobody can tell you for certain whether there will be any
&gt; problems. However as far as I can see it right now, as long as your period
&gt; duration is reasonable high enough (i.e. &gt; 1 ms), then I currently don't see a
&gt; reason why it should not work reliably with JACK2.
&gt;
&gt; Interesting test case though.

Sure, Is there a dummy driver example I can use in Jack2 ?
The IIO subsystem uses a mmap data acquisition approach. In that 
respect, blocking ioctl calls to dequeue new data from the kernel 
subsystem are used in the 'read' methods of the class.
Can you suggest which driver class should be inherited ?

thanks
