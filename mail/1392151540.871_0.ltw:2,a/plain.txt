Sure, Is there a dummy driver example I can use in Jack2 ?
The IIO subsystem uses a mmap data acquisition approach. In that 
respect, blocking ioctl calls to dequeue new data from the kernel 
subsystem are used in the 'read' methods of the class.
Can you suggest which driver class should be inherited ?
