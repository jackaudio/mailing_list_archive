&gt; &gt; It is very likely that you are the first one who ever tried such high

&gt; &gt; your period duration is reasonable high enough (i.e. &gt; 1 ms), then I
&gt; &gt; currently don't see a reason why it should not work reliably with JACK2.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Interesting test case though.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, Is there a dummy driver example I can use in Jack2 ?

You mean an arbitrary small driver as template for writing this new driver?

&gt; The IIO subsystem uses a mmap data acquisition approach. In that
&gt; respect, blocking ioctl calls to dequeue new data from the kernel
&gt; subsystem are used in the 'read' methods of the class.

Mmmm, the mechanism behind page faults involved in mmaps could cause a 
performance penalty. But since you said the driver is already running fine 
without RT issues, it might be OK.
