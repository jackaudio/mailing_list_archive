i don't have one. the only error message I've seen thus far is:


$ jack_rec -f /dev/null -B 2048 -d 1 system:capture_1 system:capture_2
disk thread finished
jackrec failed with 977 overruns.
 try a bigger buffer than -B 2048.

I don't know the insides of jack_rec well enough to know what those
messages mean. Did you try "a bigger buffer than -B 2048" ?
