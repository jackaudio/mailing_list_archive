&gt;&gt;         Hi there,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         I am experiencing problems with high sample rates when using
&gt;&gt;         jack.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Whilst the driver is more then capable of reading data at
&gt;&gt;         high sample rates, it seems that the client falls over when
&gt;&gt;         it tries to interact.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     you haven't stated the buffer size you're using (in units of
&gt;&gt;     samples and msecs). what you're describing seems entirely like
&gt;&gt;     what would be expected to happen when you require better
&gt;&gt;     scheduling latency characteristics than either your kernel or
&gt;&gt;     apps can deliver.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;     I have tested with various period sizes, number of periods and so
&gt;     on. Whilst the driver doesn't indicate any xruns, the client does.
&gt;     What is your interpretation ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i don't have one. the only error message I've seen thus far is:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; $ jack_rec -f /dev/null -B 2048 -d 1 system:capture_1 system:capture_2
&gt; disk thread finished
&gt; jackrec failed with 977 overruns.
&gt;  try a bigger buffer than -B 2048.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know the insides of jack_rec well enough to know what those 
&gt; messages mean. Did you try "a bigger buffer than -B 2048" ?

I feel the same as you regarding jack_rec, not really sure what it is 
doing internally.

Yes, the information above was me running on a very grunty desktop CPU 
... when I execute on the ARM core, the number of overruns are 
insurmountable (1e5 or 1e6) ... even when extending to 32768 buffer 
sizes ... I think there is a second order sad face profile in execution 
efficiency vs. block (buffer) size ... surely the performance keeps 
improving as you increase the buffer size until you reach the page size 
? I would imagine that once you increase across the page size boundary 
the performance starts to decrease again... hence the sad face, with the 
best performance at the top of the curve.

I also tried going direct into netjack, in an effort to ensure that what 
was in memory stayed in memory ... this is because I did notice that 
writing to an actual file using jack_rec, rather then /dev/null was far 
far slower ... consequently the concept of piping out over a gigabit 
socket seemed a nice option ... alas, no success using netjack.

Matt
