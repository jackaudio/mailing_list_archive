&gt; &gt;I don't know the insides of jack_rec well enough to know what
&gt; &gt;those messages mean. Did you try "a bigger buffer than -B 2048" ?
&gt; I feel the same as you regarding jack_rec, not really sure what it
&gt; is doing internally.

Have you hacked jackd, so it supports the buffer size you need?

Let's assume 1024 samples @48kHz is what a contemporary system can
handle without any trouble. Some machines can do 32 samples @48kHz, but
let's be conservative for a start.

48000/1024 = ~47 invocations per second

For your 1MHz, we do the same:

1000000/x = 47  --&gt; x = 21276, rounded up to the next power-of-two, we
arrive at 32768 samples per buffer.

Assuming you use jackd2, tweak BUFFER_SIZE_MAX:

common/JackConstants.h:#define BUFFER_SIZE_MAX 8192

and make sure it really works ;) (I didn't test it, just grepped through
the code).

Maybe jackd -d something -p 8192 is already sufficient. It'll give you
roughly 122 invocations per second, probably close enough to 47. ;)


Oh, and regarding jack_rec (that's capture_client.c): Make the
ringbuffer at least twice as large as your server's period size. So if
you start with -p 8192, you should have at least -B 16384, which is the
default anyway. If you want to be safe, don't hesitate to raise this to
a couple of megabytes.

Speaking of capture_client.c:

--- cut ---
 /* Write the data one frame at a time.  This is
  * inefficient, but makes things simpler. */
 while (info-&gt;can_capture &amp;&amp;
        (jack_ringbuffer_read_space (rb) &gt;= bytes_per_frame)) {
               jack_ringbuffer_read (rb, framebuf, bytes_per_frame);

              if (sf_writef_float (info-&gt;sf, framebuf, 1) != 1) {
--- end ---


The comment says it all, but for the sake of clarity, let me rephrase
this: for every sample in the ringbuffer, the disk thread invokes
jack_ringbuffer_read_space() followed by jack_ringbuffer_read(),
followed by sf_writef_float(). This works if you only have chans*48k
samples per second, but maybe at 1MHz, this is sufficiently inefficient
to waste time with function calls and maybe atomic operations in
jack_ringbuffer_read() (not sure, I didn't bother to check).

Long story short: patch capture_client.c so that it reads multiple
bytes_per_frame at once. You basically enlarge framebuf, read
array_size*bytes_per_frame and pass array_size samples to
sf_writef_float.

No idea if 2048 samples are enough.


And while we're at it, the process() function in capture_client.c (the
jackd side of the ringbuffer) isn't terribly efficient either. I'd
either get rid of interleaved samples (use multiple ringbuffers instead)
and/or prepare an intermediate buffer with the samples arranged before
calling jack_ringbuffer_write to avoid too frequent calls.


To sum things up: use large buffers wherever possible.
