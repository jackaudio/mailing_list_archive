Le 12 f&#xE9;vr. 2014 &#xE0; 08:14, Matt Flax &lt;[hidden]&gt; a &#xE9;crit :

&gt; I have implemented the jack2 iio driver and have done a couple of tests.
&gt; 
&gt; In a preliminary finding, waiting for more time to test and re-test, I have had success.
&gt; I don't see any overruns reported (when setup properly), and I haven't put a signal through the system to highlight any un-reported overruns. Next week I will look into this more.
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly I would like to say that writing a driver for jack2 is a little difficult because there is not much documentation ... at least I couldn't find simple information. Some inline src doc would be good ... mind you, I could have put more into my driver as well :)
&gt; 
&gt; On the system with IIO devices I ran :
&gt; jackd -iio
&gt; 
&gt; I then setup and ran netjack on both computers.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other computer I used :
&gt; jack_capture -c 2 -p system:capture*
&gt; 
&gt; ... wahlah ... it worked ! with an MTU of 1500. Thats 2 channels @ 1 MHz
&gt; 
&gt; Everything reporting 1MHz sample rates and so on a so forth, no xruns and the wav file looked like what I expected ...
&gt; 
&gt; When I tried to record 4 channels @ 1 MHz, I had to increase the MTU to 6000 to get rid of xruns on the ARM core. But still ... 4 channels @ 1MHz over a network ... pretty good start !
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to integrate my both of my iio branchs into the jack1 and jack2 repos, but for now I have forked the jack2 repo here :
&gt; https://github.com/flatmax/jack2/tree/iio

When ready, do a "merge request".
&gt; 
&gt; I have some questions for other developers of jack2.
&gt; is it necessary to use :
&gt;     JackDriver::CycleTakeBeginTime();
&gt; and
&gt;     JackDriver::CycleTakeEndTime();

Sure: this code is used to take "timestamps" at the beginning and end of driver cycle, so that DSP CPU consumption can be computed later on.
