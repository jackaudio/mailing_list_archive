Yeah, it's pretty easy:

    $ git checkout -b for-upstream
    $ git rebase -i last_good_commit
    (use fixup everywhere)

Pull requests would be better, so we can use github's inline comments.
You can even update pull requests which removes the burden from creating
the patch over and over again.
