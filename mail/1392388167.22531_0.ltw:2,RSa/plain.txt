Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Recent addition of IIO driver

Hi sletz!

It looks like you've accepted Matt Flax's pull request into the
codebase as-is.

Sorry for kicking in late, I should have really reviewed the patches
earlier. I'm not comfortable with the following patches:

 
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/03a99695f002a7e35aeae8a8c25c2af6d04bc266

2105 additions, 2104 deletions, just to add a single line to a file.

 
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/commit/23f5919c6249a12cf9e96fb7854235fccc2741b3

Multiple unrelated changes in one commit, no justification for __ARM__.


Not to mention the many dirty lines wrt clodeBlocks and the lot.


I took the liberty to revert all of Matt's commits and to create a new
cleaner sequence by cherry-picking and merging them into three
individual commits.

That said, I've just pushed my cleanup branch to github with the
following differences to the previous patch series:

    - HAVE_PPOLL is still defined in linux/wscript. Matt has removed this
      line without any justifaction. Since commit messages also serve as
      documentation, I need a rationale before removing it.

    - __ARM__ not added to systemdeps.h. I still haven't received a valid
      pointer from Matt why this would be necessary. Show me a compiler
      that needs it, and I'll add it.

    - Fixed Matt's email address in linux/iio/*.{cpp,h}.

    - Didn't add Matt to the ChangeLog file. We can still do this in a
      separate commit without altering 2104 lines.


We now have a proper git history again. No additional work is required
on Matt's or your side.



Cheers
