Matt, I hate to bother you again, but as mentioned in the commit
message, I didn't carefully review your code, assuming Stephane has
already done that.

I see the following checks:

adi@chopin:~/jackaudio/jack2/linux$ grep -R SOX *
wscript:    conf.env['BUILD_DRIVER_IIO'] += conf.is_defined('HAVE_SOX')

adi@chopin:~/jackaudio/jack2/linux$ grep -R GTK *
wscript:    conf.env['BUILD_DRIVER_IIO'] = 
conf.is_defined('HAVE_GTKIOSTREAM')
wscript:        create_jack_driver_obj(bld, 'iio', iio_driver_src, 
["GTKIOSTREAM", "EIGEN3"])

adi@chopin:~/jackaudio/jack2/linux$ grep -R EIGEN *
wscript:    conf.env['BUILD_DRIVER_IIO'] += conf.is_defined('HAVE_EIGEN3')
wscript:        create_jack_driver_obj(bld, 'iio', iio_driver_src, 
["GTKIOSTREAM", "EIGEN3"])


But I don't see *any* reference to SOX, GTK or EIGEN3 in the code. What
am I missing? Is it a left-over?


Cheers
