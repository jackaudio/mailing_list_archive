&gt;&gt; It looks like you've accepted Matt Flax's pull request into the
&gt;&gt; codebase as-is.
&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt; We now have a proper git history again. No additional work is required
&gt;&gt; on Matt's or your side.
&gt;
&gt; Matt, I hate to bother you again, but as mentioned in the commit
&gt; message, I didn't carefully review your code, assuming Stephane has
&gt; already done that.
&gt;
&gt; I see the following checks:
&gt;
&gt; adi@chopin:~/jackaudio/jack2/linux$ grep -R SOX *
&gt; wscript:    conf.env['BUILD_DRIVER_IIO'] += conf.is_defined('HAVE_SOX')
&gt;
Good catch, at this point it is likely that SOX isn't necessary as I am 
currently not linking a library which links against it. This may be 
necessary in the future, but you'll hear from me then about it. When  I 
go in and implement some of your suggestions and issue a pull request 
again, this should disappear.

&gt; adi@chopin:~/jackaudio/jack2/linux$ grep -R GTK *
&gt; wscript:    conf.env['BUILD_DRIVER_IIO'] = 
&gt; conf.is_defined('HAVE_GTKIOSTREAM')
&gt; wscript:        create_jack_driver_obj(bld, 'iio', iio_driver_src, 
&gt; ["GTKIOSTREAM", "EIGEN3"])
&gt;
This isn't GTK, this is gtkIOStream, which implements much of the IIO 
code. I want more of the code in libgtkiostream.so but when I was 
linking for jack1, the driver_initialize function was complaining about 
not being able to find the vtable for certain c++ methods. I am going to 
address this at a later point, however the gtkIOStream includes are most 
certainly necessary.

&gt; adi@chopin:~/jackaudio/jack2/linux$ grep -R EIGEN *
&gt; wscript:    conf.env['BUILD_DRIVER_IIO'] += 
&gt; conf.is_defined('HAVE_EIGEN3')
&gt; wscript:        create_jack_driver_obj(bld, 'iio', iio_driver_src, 
&gt; ["GTKIOSTREAM", "EIGEN3"])
&gt;
&gt;
Yes, Eigen is used to manage memory and will be used to efficiently 
rescale the data collected from the IIO devices, which is fixed point, 
to scaled floating point... to come.

&gt; But I don't see *any* reference to SOX, GTK or EIGEN3 in the code. What
&gt; am I missing? Is it a left-over?
&gt;
Thanks for putting in the time to clean up a little, I can see that you 
like to run a tidy ship :)

Matt
