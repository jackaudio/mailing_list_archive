Good catch, at this point it is likely that SOX isn't necessary as I am 
currently not linking a library which links against it. This may be 
necessary in the future, but you'll hear from me then about it. When  I 
go in and implement some of your suggestions and issue a pull request 
again, this should disappear.

This isn't GTK, this is gtkIOStream, which implements much of the IIO 
code. I want more of the code in libgtkiostream.so but when I was 
linking for jack1, the driver_initialize function was complaining about 
not being able to find the vtable for certain c++ methods. I am going to 
address this at a later point, however the gtkIOStream includes are most 
certainly necessary.

Yes, Eigen is used to manage memory and will be used to efficiently 
rescale the data collected from the IIO devices, which is fixed point, 
to scaled floating point... to come.

Thanks for putting in the time to clean up a little, I can see that you 
like to run a tidy ship :)
