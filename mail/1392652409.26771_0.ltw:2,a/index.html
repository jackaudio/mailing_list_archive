&gt;&gt; It turns out that a listing of /dev/shm showed that the named semaphore

&gt;&gt; Of course, how that could happen is baffling.
&gt;
&gt; You haven't mentioned which version of JACK you are using.

1.9.9.5


 &gt; Named semaphores are created by JACK like this:
&gt;
&gt; 	sem_open(fName, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0777, value);
&gt;
&gt; This is a POSIX API call where also the permission tuple is given, so if a
&gt; semaphore of the given name does not exist, it will be created by the OS with
&gt; the given permission tuple, masked against the process' permission tuple.
&gt;
&gt; I currently don't see a reason why JACK could be blamed for the semaphore
&gt; being created with 700 there. My guess is that it might be caused by incorrect
&gt; permissions being set to the JACK server binary. From the sem_open() man page:

I wasn't really "blaming" JACK, just was confused as to why it would 
cease to function correctly. I have a bit more digging to do, but thanks 
for the response.
