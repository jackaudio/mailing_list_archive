Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK output via Bluetooth

I use JACK-based programs for making music, like Rosegarden and Qtractor.

It would be nice to couple my notebook via Bluetooth to an HiFi amp to
do some work that doesn't need low latencies and best audio quality,
like arranging and recording MIDI-tracks.

So I bought a Philips Bluetooth adapter and connected it to my HiFi amp.

ALSA-clients can successfully output their audio to the device
btphilips. My .asoundrc looks like:

pcm.btphilips {
    type plug
    slave {
        pcm {
            type bluetooth
            device "00:1D:DF:E4:59:B6"
            profile "auto"
            }
          }
     hint {
          show on
          description "Philips Bluetooth Adapter"
          }
}

To use it with JACK I tried

1.) alsa_out
    There is some recognizable signal but it's totally distorted. Maybe
    a conversion from float to 16 bit integer ist needed.

2.) zita-j2a
    It can't be run. It complains:

    hm@wolke:~$ zita-j2a -v -p 128 -c 2 -d btphilips
    Alsa_pcmi: detected more than 1024 playback channnels, reset to 2.
    Alsa_pcmi: can't set playback period size to 128.
    Can't open ALSA playback device 'btphilips'.

Any ideas how JACK-based programs can output via Bluetooth?
