Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Questions

Dear Sir,

I hope you can point me in the right direction.

I am a sound system engineer set-up big concert sound systems for 
temperery live sound productions.
You can imagen this needs more input and output than only left and 
right. And it have the need of good eq's and delay's to tweaking the 
sound system for the best performance in the room acoustics.
So I'm searching for a system which I can put between the FOH mixing 
desk and the Amp's.
I think to do this with a good outboard sound card via Firewire (focus 
rite saffire PRO24 and a strong (CPU and memory) computer (not there 
jet) to run plugins.
It must handle say 8x input's and 8x output's via a sort of matrix to 
say which input should go to which output and in between the EQ's and 
Delay's.
And it all sould be at all times on the fly tweakable (LIVE)

I hope you understand what I say.

Now the question can this be done in the jack environment with your 
plugin's and all the questions you can imagen.
And is Unbutu here good for?
And I have a windows based program Smaart V7 this is an audio analys 
program run on Unbutu with wine?

And loads of other questions.

I don't know if I must ask this things to you but I hope you can point 
me or even help me so not

Many thanks in advance.
