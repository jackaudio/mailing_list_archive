&gt; Dear Sir,
&gt;
&gt; I hope you can point me in the right direction.
&gt;
&gt; I am a sound system engineer set-up big concert sound systems for
&gt; temperery live sound productions.
&gt; You can imagen this needs more input and output than only left and
&gt; right. And it have the need of good eq's and delay's to tweaking the
&gt; sound system for the best performance in the room acoustics.
&gt; So I'm searching for a system which I can put between the FOH mixing
&gt; desk and the Amp's.
&gt; I think to do this with a good outboard sound card via Firewire (focus
&gt; rite saffire PRO24 and a strong (CPU and memory) computer (not there
&gt; jet) to run plugins.
&gt; It must handle say 8x input's and 8x output's via a sort of matrix to
&gt; say which input should go to which output and in between the EQ's and
&gt; Delay's.
&gt; And it all sould be at all times on the fly tweakable (LIVE)
&gt;

Yes.

However you will need to do some configuration to make it do everything
you are looking for. There are several methods to achieve a decent FOH
system with JACK.  Although there is nothing that is specifically designed
to address all the issues in a compact one size fits all solution.

Work has been started on FOH system with the JAMin project but it has
stalled due to lack of input/time.



&gt; I hope you understand what I say.
&gt;
&gt; Now the question can this be done in the jack environment with your
&gt; plugin's and all the questions you can imagen.
&gt; And is Unbutu here good for?

Any recent Linux OS will allow you to accomplish the task.

&gt; And I have a windows based program Smaart V7 this is an audio analys
&gt; program run on Unbutu with wine?
&gt;

It might run under wine but you may also be able to run it with a virtual
machine or with jack on windows.

&gt; And loads of other questions.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if I must ask this things to you but I hope you can point
&gt; me or even help me so not
&gt;

Feel free to ask more questions.


&gt; Many thanks in advance.
