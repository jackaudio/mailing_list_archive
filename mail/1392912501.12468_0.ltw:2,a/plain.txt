Yes.

However you will need to do some configuration to make it do everything
you are looking for. There are several methods to achieve a decent FOH

Work has been started on FOH system with the JAMin project but it has
stalled due to lack of input/time.

It might run under wine but you may also be able to run it with a virtual
machine or with jack on windows.
