&gt; It must handle say 8x input's and 8x output's via a sort of matrix to

no problem. 8in x 8out easily. There are WFS systems running with JACK
that have orders or magnitude more ins+outs.

&gt; Now the question can this be done in the jack environment with your
&gt; plugin's and all the questions you can imagen.

You'll want very low-latency, and the main requirement is not
necessarily a very strong CPU, but a carefully selected hardware. Often
it's the graphics-card or BIOS or motherboard IRQ-routing that imposes
the the lower limit on this. There are some hints at
http://manual.ardour.org/setting-up-your-system/the-right-computer-system-for-digital-audio/

&gt; And is Unbutu here good for?

No,  not unless you're prepared to spend hours tweaking it for reliably
realtime performance - it can be done, but default Ubuntu's not an easy
starting point.

You may want to check out http://www.bandshed.net/AVLinux.html it runs
live from DVD/memory stick, and if you're happy you can install it.

AVlinux has lots of audio-software pre-installed (EQ, delayline,
plugins,..) both free software as well as demos from commercial software.

There are also many other similar "pro audio" GNU/Linux distributions.
e.g.  UbuntuStudio, KXStudio,...


&gt; And I have a windows based program Smaart V7 this is an audio analys
&gt; program run on Unbutu with wine?

I don't know.  What does it do for you? There may be similar or
equivalent solutions on GNU/Linux.

As for a more general statement see:
http://manual.ardour.org/working-with-plugins/windows-vst-support/

"[..] Making Linux pretend that it is really a Windows [..]" -- sure, it
can work, but I'd not trust it for anything that needs to work reliably,
live on-stage. YMMV.

&gt; And loads of other questions.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if I must ask this things to you but I hope you can point
&gt; me or even help me so not
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks in advance.
&gt; 

Cheers!
robin
