no problem. 8in x 8out easily. There are WFS systems running with JACK
that have orders or magnitude more ins+outs.

You'll want very low-latency, and the main requirement is not
necessarily a very strong CPU, but a carefully selected hardware. Often
it's the graphics-card or BIOS or motherboard IRQ-routing that imposes
the the lower limit on this. There are some hints at

No,  not unless you're prepared to spend hours tweaking it for reliably
realtime performance - it can be done, but default Ubuntu's not an easy
starting point.

You may want to check out http://www.bandshed.net/AVLinux.html it runs
live from DVD/memory stick, and if you're happy you can install it.

AVlinux has lots of audio-software pre-installed (EQ, delayline,
plugins,..) both free software as well as demos from commercial software.

There are also many other similar "pro audio" GNU/Linux distributions.
e.g.  UbuntuStudio, KXStudio,...

I don't know.  What does it do for you? There may be similar or
equivalent solutions on GNU/Linux.

As for a more general statement see:
http://manual.ardour.org/working-with-plugins/windows-vst-support/

"[..] Making Linux pretend that it is really a Windows [..]" -- sure, it
can work, but I'd not trust it for anything that needs to work reliably,
live on-stage. YMMV.
