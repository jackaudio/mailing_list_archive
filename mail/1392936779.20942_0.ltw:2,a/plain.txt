Subject:     [Jack-Devel] remove server name option from JACK GUI control apps

After a long time debugging a problem with a user on IRC today, I would
like to formally request:

   No JACK control application should expose the "server name" setting to
users.

There are almost no users (and almost no docs) on how to use this setting.
Blindly setting the server name will cause JACK to break for almost all
users.

There are cases where competent sysadmins might want to use it. But it
should not be a part of the GUI of any control app targetting normal users.

Please remove it if it is present in your application.

sincerely,
--p
