In-Reply-To: Paul Davis [Jack-Devel] remove server name option from JACK GUI control apps (1392936779.20942_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] remove server name option from JACK GUI control apps

I even saw a case where Qjackctl server name setting (I think is was there)  that was by default : "default"  had been translated in german or french. by a possible quite generous translator ((-;, thus causing a complete configuration failure ))-;
