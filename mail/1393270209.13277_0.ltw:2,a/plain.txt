Double speed, or half speed?  I would expect mplayer to run at half speed
if mplayer was attempting to play a file with 44100 (or 48000) audio at
22005 and mplayer was not aware of the correct sample rate.
Something will have to perform sample rate conversion on the audio, either
mplayer if it can, or a component inserted between mplayer and jack. 
Probably making mplayer perform the sample rate conversion itself is the
only practical way to do it.
