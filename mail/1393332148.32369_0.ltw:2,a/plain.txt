Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] half bitrate double speed playback

Thanks Chris for the help,

mplayer runs at double speed, so as to fill the sample 'gap'.

mplayer seems to understand the following arguments:

-srate 22050 -af lavcresample=22050

The documentation states both -srate and -af have to be present .. I am
not quiet sure, that I understand this: what is the srate argument on
its own standing for? It should imply the resampling, or not?


Regards,
Mario
