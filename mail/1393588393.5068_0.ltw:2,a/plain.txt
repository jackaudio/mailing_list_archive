CPU scaling very often leads to xruns. However I wondered, has somebody 
investigated this issue in depth already?

I mean, it seems as if Macbooks are also using CPU scaling, still providing 
very solid low latency stability with its XNU kernel. So I wonder if CPU 
scaling is not appropriately handled (regarding the aspect of low latency) in 
the Linux kernel. Any thoughts?
