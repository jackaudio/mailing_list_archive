Dear Adrian,

thanks for your notes, in fact when I said "any feedback is welcome" I
meant it and some of your comments may be very useful in making it 
better.

I know, the idea was something similar to jacktrip but able to send 
different
channels to different IP's possibly changing in realtime (why? long 
story).
I know this feature is not still there but it can be added easily (in 
fact we
have some even dirtier code that does it, but let's clean this up before
releasing!)

I know, but (correct me if I'm wrong) netjack requires having JACK 
running
with network backend in the slave machine. Said this, it's true it's 
bound
to overrun/underrun sooner or later, for now we simply accepted this. I
think it also depends on the purpose, I for one wouldn't want this for
recording for example.

Ok, we are definitely going to fix the network part, also following the
feedback from Outro Pessoa.

...totally true and ugly... this was like a leftover from the very first
draft and needs to be changed, thanks for reporting this!

thanks for the hint!

well, we'll just try to improve it! In the best case scenario I think it
can be a nice toy or maybe a starting point for something else, so
probably not life changing but (in my totally personal and biased 
opinion)
let's say I find it "enjoyable" when actually using it.
Now we'll focus on the problems, because it has been pointed out it
doesn't work on certain platforms and because of your comments, 
expecially
the network part definitely needs some adjustment.

Again, feedback is always welcome!

BR,
