In-Reply-To: Matthew Logan [Jack-Devel] Win64: Multiple Clients from a single process (1393884755.12072_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Win64: Multiple Clients from a single process

Should not happen:

- can you possibly start jackd in a console in verbose mode like,

jackd -v -d portaudio -d XXXX

- then start your application and send what is display in jack console.

Thanks
