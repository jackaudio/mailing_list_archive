Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

Greetings,

 

I'm looking to implement Jack client/server functionalities inside my
application on Windows 8.1 x64.

 

I actually manage to make it work by installing Jack 1.9.9 and starting
qjackctl.exe as a server. My app connect to it and it works fine.

 

Now, the ideal scenario would to use my app as being a Jack server without
having the need for any prior Jack installation at all. 

 

If it is in fact doable,  could anyone point me where to start?

 

Thanks,
