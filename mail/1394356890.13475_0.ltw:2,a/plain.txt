Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

You can use the so called "control API" to do that (see control.h public header file).

The "jackd" server is started this way and you can see the code in Jackdmp.cpp file.

Note that having your own application starts the server itself breaks a bit the JACK model, since usually "jackd" is supposed to be started outside off any concrete application, so that closing your application would not "disturb" the whole setup….

What is your typical use case?
