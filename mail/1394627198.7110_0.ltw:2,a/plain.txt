Why do you think that JACK has anything to do with your project?


   - Would you have some pointers on documentation or other resources to
   help me find out how to implement this bi-directional communication between
   a smart device and a custom captor via a jack audio port?

This has not been done, unless you include the recent effort at an IIO
backend, but that is still streaming data, or the MIDI backend which can be
used to send arbitrary event data but is really totally disconnected from
what you are trying to do.

   - Would you know a software that could tell me what raw data transit on
   a jack audio port (even on a PC)? Monitoring a jack audio port with
   existing devices could help me analyze data and certainly understand much
   better how everything works.

JACK sends 32 bit floating point sample values, as a continuous stream.
