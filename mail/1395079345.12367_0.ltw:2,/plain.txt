Subject:     Re: cpuinfo fix?

Adrian,
I still see in jack1 a Bus Error caused by alignment problems (alignment 
trap from dmesg), as pointed out in a bug filed to debian (no. 692562).

I could easily apply a similar workaround as the one suggested in the 
bug thread, recompiling and deb-ing the sources you left on my machine. 
What I did is a check in debian/rules for armhf (better than the hack to 
configure.ac suggested by the guy in the thread) before disabling 
optimization and indicating the mcpu.

Is this going to be fixed in the code or should it be left as it is?
Cheers
Leonardo
