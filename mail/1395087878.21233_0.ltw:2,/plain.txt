My bad, now that you mention it... I was under the impression that the
current version in Debian already has the upstream fix, but it hasn't,
hence you're seeing the bus error.

The proper fix is what I've pushed to jackd1's master two months ago,
it's a pure source code fix and doesn't require hacking configure.ac.

You basically undef POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE on ARM.


I think I'll upload a new Debian package. You can then recompile it on
wheezy if you can't use the binary from Debian unstable directly.

Paul, what do you think, should we go for a new point release (0.124.2)?
We don't have to, I'm going to package from git anyway.


Cheers
