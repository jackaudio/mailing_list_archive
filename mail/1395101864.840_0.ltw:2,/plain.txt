there are close to zero JACK developers (either JACK itself, or JACK apps)
who work on Windows.Stephane Letz, who ported JACK to Windows (and OS X)
and maintains JACK2 for Windows, has given you some feedback already, but
there are very, very few other people who would have much input into what
you are trying to do.
