I'm wondering why the hardware would require a buffer of 128frames for 
capture and 1024 for playback. If it is something related to the SW and 
can be tweaked I would gain a lot on latency. If it is *strictly* 
HW-related and cannot be overcome in any way I'll live with that or 
change platform.

I had a mic and would listen to the sound looped back between jack 
capture and playback.
Well, ear can discriminate very well between 25ms latency and ... 25ms 
latency! If it would halve as I expected it to I could tell by ear. Of 
course, I can prove it by recording the mic'ed input and the delayed output.

Cheers
