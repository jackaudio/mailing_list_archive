It is very hard to see why you want to do this.

There are two benefits to using JACK:

   (1) inter-app audio routing, using the same API for device audio routing
   (2) a simple, powerful cross-platform API for audio

If you embed the JACK client/server into a specific application/bundle,
then (1) becomes impossible.

Why do you want to use JACK at all?
