I think is some terminology confusion there. Do you mean "use MIDI inputs
from a specific application (Ableton Live) and route it to my application"
? (API = Application Programming Interface, definitely not equivalent to
"App").

OK, so as it turns out that can work since Live doesn't use JACK directly
at all. It just sees the "fake" ASIO device that JackRouter creates, which
is visible regardless of whether the JACK server or libjack are
visible/accessible.
