That is not using the TPS65950 described in the BeagleBoard user manual? 
I was not able to find any documentation on the programming interface for
the audio output at the location with the electrical datasheets:
http://www.ti.com/product/tps65950#technicaldocuments

I can't find an equivalent simple link for a TWL4030 chip.  The
description for TPS65950 looks exactly like the description for TWL4030 in
the OMAP processor brochure, did TI just change the part number at some
point?

Either way, what is needed is a register level programming guide for the
audio codec which would specify the required buffer sizes to work with the
output device.  That will show what the minimum possible latency with that
hardware will be.
