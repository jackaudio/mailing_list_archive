Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

Oh well, I'm really confused then. Thank you all for supporting my noobness.

I took from http://jackaudio.org/download
Windows
JACK2:
.Installer for Windows 64 bit (Vista, Windows 7):  Mixed 64/32 bit JACK
1.9.9.

I installed it and link the provided x64 libraries to my VS project.

I start the qjackctl.exe with the appropriate command line then use
jack_client_open, jack_port_get_buffer and jack_midi_event_get to process
the data in my app.

What am I missing?

What if someone already has Jack running (without midi enabled)?

Jack simply routes midi from one application to another.
