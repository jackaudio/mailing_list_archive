I think you are deeply confused abou the role of JACK.

What you are describing really has no place for JACK other than as a
convenience blob that happens to do MIDI parsing. There are other much
simpler and less intrusive blobs of code that can do this.

You haven't described anything that justifies even starting JACK, let alone
bundling into your app.
