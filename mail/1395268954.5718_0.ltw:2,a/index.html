Oh well, I'm really confused then. Thank you all for supporting my noobness.

I took from http://jackaudio.org/download
Windows
JACK2:
.Installer for Windows 64 bit (Vista, Windows 7):  Mixed 64/32 bit JACK
1.9.9.

I installed it and link the provided x64 libraries to my VS project.

I start the qjackctl.exe with the appropriate command line then use
jack_client_open, jack_port_get_buffer and jack_midi_event_get to process
the data in my app.

What am I missing?

 

I think you are deeply confused abou the role of JACK.

It appears so, I'll try to be more explicit so maybe someone could point me
in the right direction then.

What you are describing really has no place for JACK other than as a
convenience blob that happens to do MIDI parsing. There are other much
simpler and less intrusive blobs of code that can do this.

Very convenient indeed. Any other option comes to mind?

 

You haven't described anything that justifies even starting JACK, let alone
bundling into your app.

Basically, I'm after building a 3D visualization program that gets midi and
audio outputs from other software and create real-time visuals. Think of it
as VJing using GPU shaders and pre-rendered video. Ableton live is used as
proof of concept but any other audio software could be used. Even a
keyboard/synthesizer could be added to the chain. As a second phase, I'll
use my app to sync, send/receive data from/to other clones of my app through
a local network.

A far as I can tell, Jack supports client/server network architecture and
can process in and out midi/audio data. It seemed like a match to me. What
do you think?
