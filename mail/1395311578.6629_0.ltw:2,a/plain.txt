Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] latency: reducing buffer allocation

Chris,
after some research I found out that the TPS65950 is software and 
functionally equivalent to TWL4030 (except from a minor issue in the 
power management module we don't care).
TWL4030 datasheets cannot be found on the net, but TPS65950 are available.

Among the documents the only one that relates to registers and SW 
programming is the SWCU050, " TPS65950 OMAP™ Power Management and System 
Companion Device ES 1.2 TRM (Rev. G)", which can be downloaded only 
after signing in.

I read it thoroughly but I can't see any useful reference to buffering 
on jack's side. The audio mode (as opposed to the lower quality voice 
mode) uses a TDM interface, documented in paragraph 14.4.4.2 which 
reports about frame formats. I'm wondering if there is any relevant 
buffering on the hardware at all which must be taken care of?

Also took a look at twl4030-related ALSA code but can't find a clue, but 
I'm not an expert on audio drivers.

Regards

Leonardo
