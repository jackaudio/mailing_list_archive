Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] latency: reducing buffer allocation

Ok, sorry
I found out the cause for this 
http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2011-October/045173.html

The reason is OMAP McBSP2 having a 1280 words long buffer. Probably this 
is something that can be overcome only by ALSA devels or the original 
module devel from Texas Instruments... I'll ask
