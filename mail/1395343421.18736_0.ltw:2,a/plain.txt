Lets try to be clear here.

first, your app:

    * receives MIDI (preferably from other applications)
    * generates audio

second, JACK:

    * provides an API for sending and receiving MIDI and Audio
    * the API is identical regardless of whether the sender/reciever is an
audio device or another application
    * requires a server to function
    * can allow multiple applications to share a device even if the device
driver or hardware does not allow it

So ...

    * you are already using loopbe30 to route MIDI from another
application, so you do not need JACK for this
    * you haven't mentioned any desire to send audio anywhere except the
audio device, so you do not need JACK for this

thus, either:

  (a) there are some additional requirements that your application has
which do call for JACK
OR
  (b) you do not need to use JACK

What did I miss?
