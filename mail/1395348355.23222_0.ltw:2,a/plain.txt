Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

Hi John, thanks again for your interest in this topic.

 

Please note that coming from graphic programming and I'm still very fresh to
all this so I'm experimenting.

 

Lets try to be clear here.

first, your app:

    * receives MIDI (preferably from other applications)

    * generates audio

second, JACK:

    * provides an API for sending and receiving MIDI and Audio

    * the API is identical regardless of whether the sender/reciever is an
audio device or another application

    * requires a server to function

 

Boom right there, I need this guy even if I don't use the routing features,
for now. All I'm interested in at the moment is a way to start a Jack server
programmatically without the need of qjackctl.exe.

 

    * can allow multiple applications to share a device even if the device
driver or hardware does not allow it

So ...

    * you are already using loopbe30 to route MIDI from another application,
so you do not need JACK for this

 

I'll gladly get rid of loopbe30 if Jack can allow me not to use using
qjackctl.exe to start my app with Midi/Audio routing features.

 

    * you haven't mentioned any desire to send audio anywhere except the
audio device, so you do not need JACK for this

thus, either:

  (a) there are some additional requirements that your application has which
do call for JACK 

OR

  (b) you do not need to use JACK

 

What did I miss?

 

Regardless of the fact that I might not be using Jack to its full extent
right away. Could starting a Jack server programmatically with Midi support
be done? If yes, I'd be very interesting in doing just that. Even if I don't
need the Jack routing features ever. What's wrong with using Jack to process
the data only?
