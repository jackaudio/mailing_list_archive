Are you using C?  Does Windows not have some equivalent to the system()
call from the C standard library?

     int system(const char *string);
"The command specified by string is passed to the host environment to be
executed by the command processor."

Just have your program call to the OS to start jackd.exe with whatever
arguments you want to pass.

Paul, is that not what Ardour does to start jackd if it is not already
running when ardour starts?

As Paul has pointed out multiple times already, jack does not process
data.  The ONLY purpose of jack is to route the data.  It's like a fancy
patchbay for digital audio and MIDI data.
