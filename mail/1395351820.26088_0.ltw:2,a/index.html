Yves, you don't need Jack, and even stronger.. you shouldn't use jack for what 
you're trying to do.

As John Emmas has posted earlier, look into something like portmidi: 
http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi/

You're not looking to route audio/midi and/or connect devices, you're looking 
for something to hook you up with LoopBE, which - from what I understand - is 
what portmidi will allow you to do.

&gt; Hi John, thanks again for your interest in this topic.
&gt;
&gt; Please note that coming from graphic programming and I&#146;m still very fresh to
&gt; all this so I&#146;m experimenting.
&gt;
&gt; Lets try to be clear here.
&gt;
&gt; first, your app:
&gt;
&gt;      * receives MIDI (preferably from other applications)
&gt;
&gt;      * generates audio
&gt;
&gt; second, JACK:
&gt;
&gt;      * provides an API for sending and receiving MIDI and Audio
&gt;
&gt;      * the API is identical regardless of whether the sender/reciever is an
&gt; audio device or another application
&gt;
&gt;      * requires a server to function
&gt;
&gt; Boom right there, I need this guy even if I don&#146;t use the routing features,
&gt; for now. All I&#146;m interested in at the moment is a way to start a Jack server
&gt; programmatically without the need of qjackctl.exe.
&gt;
&gt;      * can allow multiple applications to share a device even if the device
&gt; driver or hardware does not allow it
&gt;
&gt; So ...
&gt;
&gt;      * you are already using loopbe30 to route MIDI from another application,
&gt; so you do not need JACK for this
&gt;
&gt; I&#146;ll gladly get rid of loopbe30 if Jack can allow me not to use using
&gt; qjackctl.exe to start my app with Midi/Audio routing features.
&gt;
&gt;      * you haven't mentioned any desire to send audio anywhere except the
&gt; audio device, so you do not need JACK for this
&gt;
&gt; thus, either:
&gt;
&gt;    (a) there are some additional requirements that your application has which
&gt; do call for JACK
&gt;
&gt; OR
&gt;
&gt;    (b) you do not need to use JACK
&gt;
&gt; What did I miss?
&gt;
&gt; Regardless of the fact that I might not be using Jack to its full extent right
&gt; away. Could starting a Jack server programmatically with Midi support be done?
&gt; If yes, I&#146;d be very interesting in doing just that. Even if I don&#146;t need the
&gt; Jack routing features ever. What&#146;s wrong with using Jack to process the data only?
