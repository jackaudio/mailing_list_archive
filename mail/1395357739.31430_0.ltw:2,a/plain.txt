Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

Hi Chris, thank you for your input,

 

Are you using C?  Does Windows not have some equivalent to the system() call
from the C standard library?

 

Using C++.

 

     int system(const char *string);

"The command specified by string is passed to the host environment to be
executed by the command processor."

 

Just have your program call to the OS to start jackd.exe with whatever
arguments you want to pass.

 

While this sounds like it would work. I still need to install Jackd.exe.

 

Paul, is that not what Ardour does to start jackd if it is not already
running when ardour starts?

 

> What's wrong with using Jack to process the data only?

 

As Paul has pointed out multiple times already, jack does not process data.


 

If Jack doesn't process data, what is jack_set_process_callback about? I
mean by processing the data to use jack_midi_event_get and do something with
the received data.

 

The ONLY purpose of jack is to route the data.  It's like a fancy patchbay
for digital audio and MIDI data.
