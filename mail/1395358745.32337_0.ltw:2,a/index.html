Hi peter,

I respect you point of view but what I need to do with midi data is already
working beautifully between Ableton Live and my app using Jack. Portmidi
looks like a good alternative but I won't be able to scale up with audio.

Yves, you don't need Jack, and even stronger.. you shouldn't use jack for
what you're trying to do.

As John Emmas has posted earlier, look into something like portmidi: 
http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi/

You're not looking to route audio/midi and/or connect devices, you're
looking for something to hook you up with LoopBE, which - from what I
understand - is what portmidi will allow you to do.

Like I mentioned earlier, LoopBe is on the experimental path, I don't have
the full scope (obviously) of Jack yet. I'm looking for an API that does
simple midi in/out (to start with) but that is also scalable for Audio and
Networking. So yes, I'd like to synchronize apps/devices eventually.

&gt; Hi John, thanks again for your interest in this topic.
&gt;
&gt; Please note that coming from graphic programming and I'm still very 
&gt; fresh to all this so I'm experimenting.
&gt;
&gt; Lets try to be clear here.
&gt;
&gt; first, your app:
&gt;
&gt;      * receives MIDI (preferably from other applications)
&gt;
&gt;      * generates audio
&gt;
&gt; second, JACK:
&gt;
&gt;      * provides an API for sending and receiving MIDI and Audio
&gt;
&gt;      * the API is identical regardless of whether the sender/reciever 
&gt; is an audio device or another application
&gt;
&gt;      * requires a server to function
&gt;
&gt; Boom right there, I need this guy even if I don't use the routing 
&gt; features, for now. All I'm interested in at the moment is a way to 
&gt; start a Jack server programmatically without the need of qjackctl.exe.
&gt;
&gt;      * can allow multiple applications to share a device even if the 
&gt; device driver or hardware does not allow it
&gt;
&gt; So ...
&gt;
&gt;      * you are already using loopbe30 to route MIDI from another 
&gt; application, so you do not need JACK for this
&gt;
&gt; I'll gladly get rid of loopbe30 if Jack can allow me not to use using 
&gt; qjackctl.exe to start my app with Midi/Audio routing features.
&gt;
&gt;      * you haven't mentioned any desire to send audio anywhere except 
&gt; the audio device, so you do not need JACK for this
&gt;
&gt; thus, either:
&gt;
&gt;    (a) there are some additional requirements that your application 
&gt; has which do call for JACK
&gt;
&gt; OR
&gt;
&gt;    (b) you do not need to use JACK
&gt;
&gt; What did I miss?
&gt;
&gt; Regardless of the fact that I might not be using Jack to its full 
&gt; extent right away. Could starting a Jack server programmatically with Midi
support be done?
&gt; If yes, I'd be very interesting in doing just that. Even if I don't 
&gt; need the Jack routing features ever. What's wrong with using Jack to
process the data only?
&gt;
