Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

Hi peter,

I respect you point of view but what I need to do with midi data is already
working beautifully between Ableton Live and my app using Jack. Portmidi
looks like a good alternative but I won't be able to scale up with audio.

Yves, you don't need Jack, and even stronger.. you shouldn't use jack for
what you're trying to do.

As John Emmas has posted earlier, look into something like portmidi: 
http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi/

You're not looking to route audio/midi and/or connect devices, you're
looking for something to hook you up with LoopBE, which - from what I
understand - is what portmidi will allow you to do.

Like I mentioned earlier, LoopBe is on the experimental path, I don't have
the full scope (obviously) of Jack yet. I'm looking for an API that does
simple midi in/out (to start with) but that is also scalable for Audio and
Networking. So yes, I'd like to synchronize apps/devices eventually.
