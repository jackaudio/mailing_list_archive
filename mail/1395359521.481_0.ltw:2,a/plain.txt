Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack

Hi Paul, I can feel hope here! J

 

He wants to generate audio too. Since JACK does both (and with a fairly
similar API) you can see the appeal.

However, the added complexity of the server/client architecture make this
somewhat inappropriate in my opinion. Not stupid, but probably not the right
approach (at least on Windows).

 

I'm interested in the client/server features in and I don't mind going that
road. 

 

I'm a little surprised that the focus of attention is whether or not I need
Jack. rather than the original question. I still don't have any clue if I
can use Jack SDK to start a server programmatically without external
dependency other than the Jack libraries.
