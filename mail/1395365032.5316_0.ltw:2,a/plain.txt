the command that will start a JACK server.

it is not "called" at all. the command is placed into $HOME/.jackdrc and
then libjack reads it from there and starts the server using the command it
finds in the file.

i already told you that qjackctl also writes to this file.

yes, in your case, which is odd and unusual and you seem to want it to work
with very little effort on your part.

so that clients that need the server will just find it running, with the
same parameters as it was last started with. clients can explicitly request
that jack_client_open() should NOT do this if they prefer.

a control application is an app that exists for no purpose other than to
configure and control JACK. qjackctl is an example of one such application.
JackPilot on OS X is another. Carla on Linux is another. patchage on Linux
is another (though this is purely a patchbay, it does not offer server
startup+configuration). another way to put it is "an application that has
no JACK ports and does not register a JACK process callback".

it does not.

we've explained this several times. JACK was not designed to be used in the
way you want to use it.

if you want full control over the server startup, use the control API to
start the server. if that is too complex, use $HOME/.jackdrc. If neither of
those work for you, then don't use JACK at all.


conventionally JACK is started by the user as a separate step from starting
any client applications. the cases where this is not done (e.g. Ardour or
Mixbus) have been coded by people who know a great deal about JACK and have
had to deal with a variety of subtle issues with doing this.


there is a  LOT of (non-windows) example code, documentation of the control
API ... you are going to have to start digging because nobody is going to
hand this to you on a plate.
