The jack source code should not force packing that violates alignment
constraints that are stated in C (and C++ too I guess)
standard. I.e. accessing variable of size N must be done only through
pointer aligned to N. Default struct composition ensures this. If
forced packing is done because of memory shared with process running in
different model, padding that ensures the above rule must be done too.
