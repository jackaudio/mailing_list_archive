Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Hi there, a questions about saving Jack Connection Presets

Hi, I'm running windows 7 64 bit, Ableton live 9 and Traktor Pro 2.

I tried pathchbay just now, the problem is that both my mic inserts and
traktor needs to go into ableton but I can't seem to route speficic ports
in patchbay like I can in connections so the mic1 and mic2 share the
ableton ports with traktor 1 and traktor2. any way around it?


Thanks all for thehelp
