Subject:     [Jack-Devel] list all JACK2 devices

Excuse me if I've asked this before on this list, I don't think I have, but
I could have tried before and forgot or just got no reply last time.

I recently created a little script to simplify the process of switching
between JACK2 output devices called j2ds:

http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/j2ds?content=164295

The problem is that it currently only supports ALSA devices because I don't
know the command to get JACK2 to output a list of all currently connected
ALSA, FFADO and other devices.

Does such a command exist? If not, whats the command to list all currently
connected FFADO devices, pref. in a format that J2 can readily parse?

Thanks!

Dan
