Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] scale2n1 configure option patch

Argggh - too much hacking: Just re-read my description within memops.c
and it's totally misleading. It sounds like the 2^(N-1)-1 scaling has no
inverse which is not true of course. Any scaling simply won't work if
it's asymmetric. I'll write it up again tomorrow. Or better: Just remove
the comment.

Good night
Uli
