Hi Adrian

The scaling affects most of the sample transfer, conversion, dithering
functions and macros. Wouldn't be that hard though but some profiling
has to be carried out to show if some function tables or similar hackery
would become necessary.

Perhaps I can look into it some day but currently I'm lacking the time
presumably ;)

A compile time configuration option cuts at least the ground from under
this endless scaling discussion's feet. If anyone should come up with
"2^(N-1)-1 WTF?" the noise is at least reduced to {./configure
--enable-scale2n1 | ./waf --scale2n1}.
