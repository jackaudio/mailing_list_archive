Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jackd2 RingBuffer

Hi,

I am working on a Jackd2 Client and I need to use a RingBuffer to exchange data
from Jackd2 to my client in a realtime safe way. Jack API's make available
only an implementation of a Ringbuffer in C and I have seen that exist a
C++ class "JackRingBuffer" in JackResampler.cpp (not available in API ): I
was wondering the reason behind this and if it is safe to use this class in
my code.

Thanks in advance,
