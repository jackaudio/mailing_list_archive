Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Sending audio data over the network help

Hello,

I am having tons of issues understanding jack, the documentation seems
sparse and I was hoping for some clarification.

I am looking for an application to do the following:

Send audio data (mic and headphone data) from 1 windows PC to another
windows PC on the same network (off the same switch).  I am unsure if
Jack can do this, but was attempting to follow the directions from
this set of directions:
http://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/NetJack2

I am running the following commands (as administrator):

Server:
jackd.exe -R -S -d portaudio -r 32000
-r = rate (at or over 44100 causes sync isues apparently, even with -M
9000 on the client set)

jack_load.exe netmanager -i "-a 233.252.0.1 -p 18000"
(have to set IP/Port manually, otherwise it apparently conflicts with
something as it errors out)



CLIENT:

jackd.exe -R -d net -a 233.252.0.1 -p 18000

At this point, I launch jack control on the server, and I see the
client listed there in the connections window.

In the connections window, I connect the System capture_1 (which I
assume is my microphone or headphones, either way I just want to test)
to the Client to_slave_1.  However, nothing seems to be send to the
client desktop speakers/headphones... how do I proceed?

Thank you.
