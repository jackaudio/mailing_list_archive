Mic and headphone on both PC's, or mic and headphone on 1 PC, and audio
application on a second PC?

The architecture of netjack is that the master controls the audio
hardware, the slaves are used for applications to send and receive data
from the machine with the audio hardware.
Only one machine, the master, will have active audio hardware.
Assuming you do not have native jack aware applications on Windows (there
are only a small number), the applications must use ASIO.

&gt; In the connections window, I connect the System capture_1 (which I
&gt; assume is my microphone or headphones, either way I just want to test)
&gt; to the Client to_slave_1.  However, nothing seems to be send to the
&gt; client desktop speakers/headphones... how do I proceed?

The audio hardware on the two machines is running with unsynchronized
clocks.  As mentioned the architecture is for applications to connect on
the slave machine (what you have called the client machine), so you need
an application running on the slave/client machine which will accept data
from jack, and perform asynchronous sample rate conversion to bridge from
the master clock domain to the slave clock domain.

There is a solution to that problem available on Linux, but I do not know
if there is an equivalent which works on Windows.  On linux, depending on
what version of jack you have it would be alsa_out and alsa_in, the zita
equivalents, and on newer versions of jack 1 branch (for example version
0.124) it it built in (although that implementation of jack API does not
run on Windows).

JACK has much routing flexibility and is intended for complex recording
and playback setups.
If you only want to connect microphone and headphone on two machines to
each other, it sounds like you want audio conferencing software, not jack.
