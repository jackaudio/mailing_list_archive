Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Why the syntax error?

I get "the syntax of the command is incorrect" when I try to manually 
register the dll in the 64 bit folder.
After I right click and run as administrator:

c:\windows\system32>cd\

c:\>cd progam files <x86>
the syntax of the command is incorrect

What i'm I doing wrong here? Thank You
