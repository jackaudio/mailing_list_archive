The only thing I can suggest is that you check your folder permissions 
on Win8.1.  On my system I seem to have a class of user called "ALL 
APPLICATION PACKAGES".  It might be the case that outside apps don't 
have sufficient privileges to run Jack (or something like that).  Does 
it help if you run your app as an Administrator?

Our application (Mixbus) also uses Jack and FWIW, it seems to run fine 
in Win8.1.  I'm not sure how to find out what actual version we use but 
1.9.8 seems to ring a bell (it's Jack2 BTW).
