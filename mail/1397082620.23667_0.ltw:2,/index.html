Thank you for your quick reply!

Here is what I am trying to do:  I want to play video games on one PC,
and record both my MIC and Headphones from PC 1 on PC 2. I want to do
this using as little system resources as possible on PC 1.

I set up the jack server on PC 1, and patched it back on itself, and
heard myself (loopback successful), so attempted to do the same thing
using netjack over the network.  I thought since the loopback worked
on PC 1 I could write directly to the audio devices on PC 2.
Apparently not though.

I didn't want to use a full teleconferencing software (if one exists)
to do this since I suspected the overhead would be much higher, and
thought it would be overkill.  However it appears I may need to look
at that for a solution, or figure out if it is possible to code this
myself in python.

Thanks

&gt;&gt; Send audio data (mic and headphone data) from 1 windows PC to another

&gt; Mic and headphone on both PC's, or mic and headphone on 1 PC, and audio
&gt; application on a second PC?
&gt;
&gt; The architecture of netjack is that the master controls the audio
&gt; hardware, the slaves are used for applications to send and receive data
&gt; from the machine with the audio hardware.
&gt; Only one machine, the master, will have active audio hardware.
&gt; Assuming you do not have native jack aware applications on Windows (there
&gt; are only a small number), the applications must use ASIO.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the connections window, I connect the System capture_1 (which I
&gt;&gt; assume is my microphone or headphones, either way I just want to test)
&gt;&gt; to the Client to_slave_1.  However, nothing seems to be send to the
&gt;&gt; client desktop speakers/headphones... how do I proceed?
&gt;
&gt; The audio hardware on the two machines is running with unsynchronized
&gt; clocks.  As mentioned the architecture is for applications to connect on
&gt; the slave machine (what you have called the client machine), so you need
&gt; an application running on the slave/client machine which will accept data
&gt; from jack, and perform asynchronous sample rate conversion to bridge from
&gt; the master clock domain to the slave clock domain.
&gt;
&gt; There is a solution to that problem available on Linux, but I do not know
&gt; if there is an equivalent which works on Windows.  On linux, depending on
&gt; what version of jack you have it would be alsa_out and alsa_in, the zita
&gt; equivalents, and on newer versions of jack 1 branch (for example version
&gt; 0.124) it it built in (although that implementation of jack API does not
&gt; run on Windows).
&gt;
&gt; JACK has much routing flexibility and is intended for complex recording
&gt; and playback setups.
&gt; If you only want to connect microphone and headphone on two machines to
&gt; each other, it sounds like you want audio conferencing software, not jack.
