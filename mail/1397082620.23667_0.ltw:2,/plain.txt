Thank you for your quick reply!

Here is what I am trying to do:  I want to play video games on one PC,
and record both my MIC and Headphones from PC 1 on PC 2. I want to do
this using as little system resources as possible on PC 1.

I set up the jack server on PC 1, and patched it back on itself, and
heard myself (loopback successful), so attempted to do the same thing
using netjack over the network.  I thought since the loopback worked
on PC 1 I could write directly to the audio devices on PC 2.
Apparently not though.

I didn't want to use a full teleconferencing software (if one exists)
to do this since I suspected the overhead would be much higher, and
thought it would be overkill.  However it appears I may need to look
at that for a solution, or figure out if it is possible to code this
myself in python.

Thanks
