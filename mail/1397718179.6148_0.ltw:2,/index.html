Hi Paul,
thank you for the information!
While these are all valid points, in the case of music composition entirely
on a pc (with sequencers / sound generators / and digital fx all working as
programs) capturing noise really comes 2nd. And the plethora of output
audio buses that are available on the ac97 make it rather good deal.

I don't see you saying anywhere that I cannot run the ac97 with a small
buffer size, though! :)
So If I use a preemptive kernel in linux (such as the one that is found in
ubuntu studio) and set the buffer size to something in the order of 64/128
samples , it should work flawlessly ??

any book that you may have read... or written :) would also be a very
explanatory read...

Thanks!

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; I find myself wondering again and again what makes a difference between a
&gt;&gt; simple AC '97 audio chip and a professional sound card...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I mean the chips are different, sure, but I always hear about
&gt;&gt; "professional equipement, does not go through the normal application
&gt;&gt; execution path", or something in those lines.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; marketing BS from the old windows days when the only "normal" path for
&gt; sound added 100ms. this has not been true for a long time on windows, and
&gt; has never been relevant on linux.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; both ac97 and professional chips go through ALSA (in linux at least).
&gt;&gt; what gives an edge to the professional chip then? Why can I not run an ac97
&gt;&gt; with a latency of 10msec or so (and a low latency kernel) ? I mean, the
&gt;&gt; processing power of a core i7 should be enough to run audio, right?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; latency rarely has anything to do with processing power. latency is about
&gt; the ability to meet deadlines. it is not dependent on processing power
&gt; (typically) but rather on the lack of operations that take a long time and
&gt; prevent sufficiently "on-time" processing of audio data.
&gt;
&gt; the key features of "pro" audio interfaces are typically:
&gt;
&gt;     * playback and capture streams run from the same sample clock and are
&gt; thus always synchronized
&gt;     * often have analog connections outside the radio-frequency-noisy
&gt; environment of the computer chassis
&gt;     * have the option to use an external sample clock, enabling correct
&gt; integration with multiple devices
&gt;     * lack of onboard DSP (though this varies by manufacturer)
&gt;     * ability to handle different sample rates in the hardware without
&gt; relying on resampling by the operating system device driver
&gt;
&gt; the ac97 chipset itself isn't particularly bad, but it is typically
&gt; mounted on the motherboard along with analog connection points. doing
&gt; analog-&gt;digital and digital-&gt;analog conversions in this environment is not
&gt; ideal. in addition, the ac97 chipset and specification has a lot of stuff
&gt; associated with consumer/home "theater" requirements that are not of
&gt; interest for use in pro-audio or music creation scenarios.
