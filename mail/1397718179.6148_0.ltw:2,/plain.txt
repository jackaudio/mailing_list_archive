Hi Paul,
thank you for the information!
While these are all valid points, in the case of music composition entirely
on a pc (with sequencers / sound generators / and digital fx all working as
programs) capturing noise really comes 2nd. And the plethora of output
audio buses that are available on the ac97 make it rather good deal.

I don't see you saying anywhere that I cannot run the ac97 with a small
buffer size, though! :)
So If I use a preemptive kernel in linux (such as the one that is found in
ubuntu studio) and set the buffer size to something in the order of 64/128
samples , it should work flawlessly ??

any book that you may have read... or written :) would also be a very
explanatory read...

Thanks!
