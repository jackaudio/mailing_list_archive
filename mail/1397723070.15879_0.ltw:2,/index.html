Well I was not in front of that pc at the time.
I did try it though with hydrogen and a calf FX just to make sure.
It does seem to work, but i'll have to try with a midi keyboard, which I
don't have laying around , and which is why I asked about the end result.

@Ralf, this is just an evaluation testing. To find the roof of this. But
why would professional equipement not reach down to these values (64 /128
samples, that is)?

&gt; + they provide the option to us professional interfaces, e.g. for

&gt; provide a better sound quality, at least balanced IOs, something
&gt; on-board devices usually don't provide.
