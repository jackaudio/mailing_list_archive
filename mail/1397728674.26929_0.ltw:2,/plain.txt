Subject:     [Jack-Devel] smallest embedded platform for Jack

Hi all,
I'm trying to see whether I can fit Jack into a rather simple ARM 
processor, and I was wondering the smallest embedded system people 
managed to compile and run Jack into.

My hypothetical platform is an armel (no floating point unit) with 64MB 
RAM, low speed (4-500MHz).
So far the biggest issue is RAM: my target system only has 64MB and Jack 
asks for 80-90MB usually.
The lack of a floating point unit may be another issue: converting fixed 
and floating may eat a lot of CPU, I guess.

Cheers
