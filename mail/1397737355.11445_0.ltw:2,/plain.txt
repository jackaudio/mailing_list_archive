Back in 2007, i tried to run jack on intel-hda. A simple usage (without
software DSP) worked with occasional xruns when using the minimum
allowed number of samples per buffer (8 or 16, i'm not sure) and two
buffers, and without xruns when using the next size (16 or 32).
Back then I used a -rt kernel and IIRC the version was either 2.6.17 or
2.6.21.
