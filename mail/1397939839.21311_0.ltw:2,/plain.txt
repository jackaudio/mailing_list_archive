Hi Holger,

in short: no. there is no additional latency. but, yes plugins process
the audio in larger chunks.


That assumption is wrong. jack clients are called *in* (or during) the
process call.

-=-=-
0) read N samples from the soundcard

1) call all jack-clients (incl plugins) to process N samples

2a) write the processed N sample to the soundcard's output
2b) read next N samples from the soundcard's input (same as step 0)

3) goto (1)
-=-=-


(0) never really happens but is added here to illustrate the process.
jackd just starts with an empty buffer.

(1) can include pipeline. e.g.
  "in -> client A -> client B -> client C -> out"
they are all processed in the same cycle.


in reality 2a/2b is a bit more complex. If you're interested, search the
list archive for jack2 sync/async mode, read the documentation for the
-n parameter, and feel free to ask here.

Cheers!
