Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Netjack error: “slave is running with a different protocol”

Hello,

I have two machines.

*1. Client: windows 7 64 bit*
C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack>jackd --version
...
jackdmp version 1.9.9.5 tmpdir server protocol 8

*2. Server: OS X 10.9.2*
Davids-MacBook-Pro:~ daweed$ jackd --version
...
jackdmp version 1.9.10 tmpdir /tmp protocol 8

*On server I get the same "protocol" error message and the slave cannot
connect:*

Davids-MacBook-Pro:~ daweed$ jack_load netmanager
Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory
Cannot connect to server request channel
jackdmp 1.9.10

On both machines I use the latest version of jack. It seems the OS X version
have higher protocol number than the win version. I cannot downgrade jack on
OS X to have lower protocol because this is the only jack version which
compatible with OS X 10.9. On windows I already use the latest which still
have only the protocol version 6. However, both jacks tell they use protocol
version 8.

How can I resolve this? Which versions shall I install?

Thank you!
David
