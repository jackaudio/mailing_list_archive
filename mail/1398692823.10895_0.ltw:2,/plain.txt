Subject:     [Jack-Devel] wrong samplerate

Dear devels,
I compiled the latest jack2 from git on an old debian laptop and I'm 
getting contradictory messages about the sample rate:

cmdline:
jackd -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p128 -n2

output during launch:
creating alsa driver ... hw:0|hw:0|128|2|44100|0|0|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit

output of jack_samplerate: 48000

the real sample rate is 48000
Do you think this is dependent on the sound card, ALSA or Jack?

Cheers and keep up
