Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] smallest embedded platform for Jack

Dear Patrick,
I built jack from the latest git on a armhf platform I'm currently using 
with both the defaults and with  --ports-per-application=8 --clients=8 
but obtained no change in virtual memory used by jackd2 at runtime.


Detail:
./waf configure --prefix=/usr --classic 
--libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf --alsa --ports-per-application=8 
--clients=8

./jackd -P62 -t2000 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r48000 -p128 -n2 -s -i4 -o4 &

cat /proc/4967/status:

VmPeak:       92908 kB
VmSize:       92908 kB
VmLck:       80356 kB
VmPin:           0 kB
VmHWM:       89028 kB
VmRSS:       89028 kB
VmData:        8424 kB
VmStk:         136 kB
VmExe:          16 kB
VmLib:        3476 kB
VmPTE:          98 kB
VmSwap:           0 kB
Threads:    4

Same goes if I run the default version. Maybe I got something wrong?

Leonardo
