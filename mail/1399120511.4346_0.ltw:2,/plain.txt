I personally don't use a distribution which includes Pulse Audio so I have
no direct experience with how it interacts with jack.  I do recall reading
that at least for some people Pulse Audio can cause issues when also using
Jack.  My impression was that over the last year or so things had settled
down and the two systems seemed to get along much better, but it is entirely
possible that there are some situations which still create some trouble.

>From what I recall reading it is possible to manually shut Pulse Audio down,
although the instructions for doing so may differ between distributions. 
Doing a net search for "shutting down pulseaudio in <your distribution>" or
something along these lines might turn up some useful suggestions.

Otherwise if you could provide a little more detail about what seems to be
happening on your system and what the Pulse Audio errors are there might be
someone on the list who can provide more detailed suggestions.

If it can be proven that the trouble is due to Pulse Audio interfering with
Jack it might be worth hitting the jack-devel or pulse audio mailing lists.
