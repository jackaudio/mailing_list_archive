&gt;&gt; Yes I did exactly what you said and everything works, but now I have
&gt;&gt; another problem but that's related to jack I think.  Pulse audio makes
&gt;&gt; some errors  and those are audibly so I try to kill pulse but he is coming
&gt;&gt; back even when I changed the client.conf file. So if you have any
&gt;&gt; solutions to this I love to hear them.
&gt; I personally don't use a distribution which includes Pulse Audio so I have
&gt; no direct experience with how it interacts with jack.  I do recall reading
&gt; that at least for some people Pulse Audio can cause issues when also using
&gt; Jack.  My impression was that over the last year or so things had settled
&gt; down and the two systems seemed to get along much better, but it is entirely
&gt; possible that there are some situations which still create some trouble.
&gt;
&gt;  From what I recall reading it is possible to manually shut Pulse Audio down,
&gt; although the instructions for doing so may differ between distributions.
&gt; Doing a net search for "shutting down pulseaudio in &lt;your distribution&gt;" or
&gt; something along these lines might turn up some useful suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise if you could provide a little more detail about what seems to be
&gt; happening on your system and what the Pulse Audio errors are there might be
&gt; someone on the list who can provide more detailed suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; If it can be proven that the trouble is due to Pulse Audio interfering with
&gt; Jack it might be worth hitting the jack-devel or pulse audio mailing lists.
&gt;
