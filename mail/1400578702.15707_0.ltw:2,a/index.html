Also, other two related questions:

1- To conduct the CPU tests I have a bash script that starts jackd. If I 
launch the script as user "debian", jackd gets correctly scheduled with 
realtime prio. If I launch the script as superuser with:
   sudo -u debian myscript
then jackd can't lock down memory and get the realtime priority. As if 
it was not launched by debian but the superuser. However if I put a 
"whoami" in the script I can see the script is executed as debian.

2- when jack tells me it's got realtime prio, "top" tells jackd has the 
same priority as any other tasks scheduled with the CFS.
I'm getting to think that Jack is wrong about its realtime priority: in 
any case on the current machine it is not assigned rt priority (top 
always says it's like any other task).

System: debian wheezy, armhf, jackdmp 1.9.10 compiled a couple of weeks 
ago from git

&gt; Dear all,
&gt; I've been trying to track down how the CPU usage is affected by Jack 
&gt; under different conditions of sample rate and period size. Of course I 
&gt; am aware low-level stuff such as how ALSA handles the hardware and how 
&gt; it transfers the data is relevant, and it may also show higher 
&gt; performance with some specific combinations of sample rate and sample 
&gt; size.
&gt;
&gt; Nonetheless, I'd like to have a qualitative comparison between 
&gt; different conditions. What I do is run "top" and average the values I 
&gt; find for jackd. Unfortunately - and this is startling - when combining 
&gt; jack with other clients, such as jacktrip, the measure changes a lot. 
&gt; An example:
&gt; -r44100 -p64 with jack only: jack takes 74% CPU
&gt; -r44100 -p64 with jack+jacktrip: jack takes 30%, jacktrip takes 33%
&gt;
&gt; I really can't understand why.
&gt;
&gt; By now I'm quite aware that audio software is not subject to regular 
&gt; physical laws, is not susceptible of common software engineer best 
&gt; practices and does not bend down to any debugger or debug tool but 
&gt; printf and the likes. It's a tricky world. But some insight on this 
&gt; would be nice. BTW I remember even with Puredata (under both Linux and 
&gt; Windows) was impossible to get a correct CPU measure: any tool would 
&gt; say different numbers... But maybe it's me! ;)
