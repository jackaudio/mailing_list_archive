Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] CPU load with top is inconsistent

Also, other two related questions:

1- To conduct the CPU tests I have a bash script that starts jackd. If I 
launch the script as user "debian", jackd gets correctly scheduled with 
realtime prio. If I launch the script as superuser with:
   sudo -u debian myscript
then jackd can't lock down memory and get the realtime priority. As if 
it was not launched by debian but the superuser. However if I put a 
"whoami" in the script I can see the script is executed as debian.

2- when jack tells me it's got realtime prio, "top" tells jackd has the 
same priority as any other tasks scheduled with the CFS.
I'm getting to think that Jack is wrong about its realtime priority: in 
any case on the current machine it is not assigned rt priority (top 
always says it's like any other task).

System: debian wheezy, armhf, jackdmp 1.9.10 compiled a couple of weeks 
ago from git

Regards
