&gt; 1- To conduct the CPU tests I have a bash script that starts jackd.
&gt; If I launch the script as user "debian", jackd gets correctly

&gt; with:
&gt;   sudo -u debian myscript
&gt; then jackd can't lock down memory and get the realtime priority. As

RTprio (scheduler) and the corresponding memory limits are granted via
pam_limits.

You could add

session    required     pam_limits.so

to /etc/pam.d/sudo and see if this helps.


&gt; 2- when jack tells me it's got realtime prio, "top" tells jackd has
&gt; the same priority as any other tasks scheduled with the CFS.
&gt; I'm getting to think that Jack is wrong about its realtime priority:
&gt; in any case on the current machine it is not assigned rt priority
&gt; (top always says it's like any other task).

There are several threads in a jack process, only few (one or two) run
with RTprio. top most likely just shows you the main thread that indeed
doesn't run with realtime priority.

Either use htop (showing individual threads) or chrt:


$ for i in /proc/$(pidof jackd)/task/* ; do chrt -p $(basename $i) ; done
pid 24922's current scheduling policy: SCHED_FIFO
pid 24922's current scheduling priority: 10
pid 3674's current scheduling policy: SCHED_OTHER
pid 3674's current scheduling priority: 0
pid 3703's current scheduling policy: SCHED_OTHER
pid 3703's current scheduling priority: 0
pid 3705's current scheduling policy: SCHED_OTHER
pid 3705's current scheduling priority: 0


See, one thread with SCHED_FIFO at RTprio 10.


[jackd CPU usage]
&gt; &gt;Nonetheless, I'd like to have a qualitative comparison between
&gt; &gt;different conditions. What I do is run "top" and average the
&gt; &gt;values I find for jackd. Unfortunately - and this is startling -

Assuming this is supposed to be scientific, manually averaging top isn't
exactly the most reliable approach. For a start, have a look at

You should also strive for a fully automated testing environment, so you
can easily re-run your measurements when some parameters change. In the
end, what you want is to invoke "make" which then invokes jackd (random
server name recommended), runs your tests, terminates the whole thing
and dumps the raw data. Ideally, "make postprocess" will later generate
you your R or gnuplot graphs.

Certainly not perfect, but here's what I used to call in my "make test"
target:

--- cut ---
#/bin/bash

set -e

JACK_NAME=dummy-`echo $$`
jackd -n ${JACK_NAME} -d dummy -P 20 -C 20 &amp;
JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=${JACK_NAME} jack_wait -s ${JACK_NAME} -w -t 5
JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=${JACK_NAME} ./matrix-mixer &amp;
sleep 2;
JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=${JACK_NAME} ./tester 0
JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=${JACK_NAME} ./tester 50
JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=${JACK_NAME} ./tester 100
pkill matrix-mixer

MIXFILE=$(mktemp -q) &amp;&amp; {
    for i in {0..19} ; do
        echo "s $i $i 0.5" &gt;&gt; ${MIXFILE}
    done
    sleep 1;
    JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=${JACK_NAME} ./matrix-mixer ${MIXFILE}&amp;
    sleep 2;
    JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER=${JACK_NAME} ./tester 100 50
    rm ${MIXFILE}
}

pkill -f ${JACK_NAME}
--- cut ---


You can basically ignore everything that says matrix-mixer or tester, I
just left it there for inspiration. What it does: start a random dummy
server, wait for it to be actually up, then start the application to be
tested followed by some test runs.

The MIXFILE thing is a block that creates a tmpfile, fills it with some
data, starts the application and checks the result.

For the sake of completeness (but totally unrelated to your problem), I
used this to write an end-to-end test for a jack mixer. The tester
program invoked with only one argument generates a signal at a certain
volume percentage (here: 0%, 50% and 100%) and expects this signal to be
identical at the output of the mixer. With the mixfile, I set all the
faders to 50%, then feed a signal at 100% and expect it to be 50% at the
outputs.

Very convenient to say "make test" while developing to see if the mixer
is still doing the right thing.
