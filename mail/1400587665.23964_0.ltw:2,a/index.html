&gt; I've been trying to track down how the CPU usage is affected by Jack 
&gt; under different conditions of sample rate and period size. Of course
&gt; I am aware low-level stuff such as how ALSA handles the hardware and
&gt; how it transfers the data is relevant, and it may also show higher 
&gt; performance with some specific combinations of sample rate and sample
&gt; size.

I don't know how meaningful cpu load is in a low latency environment as
that needed by jack..  Imo the execution latency (delay is far more
important). There is an utility called cyclictest in the package
rt-tests (on the AUR and in binary form in the binary
archaudio-production repo).  This is used to test the kernel's ability
to schedule realtime threads quickly (low latency).

Run something like "cyclictest -n -m -Sp98 -i100 -d0" put the system
under load (hackbench from rt-tests can be used for this), and note the
max values (in micro seconds). This value represents the max time it
would take the kernel to schedule your audio threads.  If you run it as
root, it will disable powersaving on the cpu and might yield you better values.

The "dsp load" as shown by qjackctl, is a measure of how much of the
available time has been used by the jack clients audio processing.
That is to say, if the latency given by samplerate and buffer size
means that you have 2.9ms to complete the processing of all the audio
threads, and qjackctl shows 50%, then it's taken about 1.45ms to
complete the client's audio processing.

These 2 measurements can be used to determine if a given buffersize
and audio workload will work without causing xruns (audible dropouts).

&gt; Nonetheless, I'd like to have a qualitative comparison between
&gt; different conditions. What I do is run "top" and average the values I
&gt; find for jackd. Unfortunately - and this is startling - when
&gt; combining jack with other clients, such as jacktrip, the measure
&gt; changes a lot. An example: -r44100 -p64 with jack only: jack takes
&gt; 74% CPU -r44100 -p64 with jack+jacktrip: jack takes 30%, jacktrip
&gt; takes 33%

I don't know what cpu you have, but these values sound incredibly high
for an idling jackd, maybe it's including running audio processing?

One aspect at play here might be cpu powersaving, giving you a higher
cpu load value, because the  cpu isn't running full out, thus the audio
processing taking up a bigger % of the available processing power (due
to less cpu being available in powersave mode).

As a reference on my i7-2600k using the onboard intel hd3000 gpu with
the linux-rt 3.14.3-rt5 kernel, i get max scheduling delays of about
30usecs, or 0.03ms. cpu and dsp load of jackd running with no client
attached is negligible..
