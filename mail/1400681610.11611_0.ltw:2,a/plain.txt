Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack netone problem on AM335x-evmsk board

Hello, everybody!
I met the problem with jack_netsource and jackd1 on TI AM335x-evmsk 
board.I have been  cross-comiled jack1 0.124.1 from source and patch 
time.c, because i don't have bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo. I run jackd 
master and slave both on two AM335x-EVMSK boards. When I try to run 
jackd_netsource -H <master_IP> on master I get a lot of "nextrun amount 
21ms" and less 106 or 61ms. Unfortunately I can not find any information 
on Web by this issue so trying to find right way by mail list.
Additional info:
1. I have tried 0.121.2 and 0.124.2 from git, not successful.
2. If I place slave role to Ubuntu x86 laptop with jackd 0.121.2 it's 
working pretty well, with out any xruns
3. If I place master role to Ubuntu x86 laptop and slave to AM335х-EVMSK 
it's working the same as two AM335х-EVMSK boards
4. Standalone jackd on board working well (jackd -d alsa) and I can 
connect input to output and listen music from line-in on line-out 
without xruns

P.S. I also fix some minor mistyping in freebob_driver.c in the includes 
part, but I believe it's not the ground of problem
