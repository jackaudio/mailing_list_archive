Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Possible removal of deprecated freebob driver?

Hi all

TimKa's comment in the "Jack netone problem on AM335x-evmsk board" brings up
an interesting question.  Since the firewire backend can do everything the
old freebob backend ever could plus a lot more, is it time to consider
removing the freebob backend from jack?  We (FFADO) have not touched
the freebob code for many years and I don't think the freebob jack backend
serves any useful purpose anymore.  In fact, it is reasonable to consider
the freebob backend to be an old version of what is now the firewire
backend.

Another consideration is that we do have situations where users try to use
the freebob backend instead of the firewire backend (although admittedly
this is getting rarer with time).  To avoid this sort of user confusion it
seems to me that removing the obsolete freebob backend would improve the
user experience.

Is it reasonable given the circumstances to consider removing the freebob
driver from jackd?  The only possible reason I can see for not doing so is
that it constitutes a user-visible API change which some people may not find
acceptable.
