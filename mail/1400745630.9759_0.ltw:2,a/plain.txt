Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Possible removal of deprecated freebob driver?

Actually I met troubles with cross-compiling  ffadolib during building 
jackd2 from source. It's much more complicated. So I chosed to 
cross-compile freebob lib, especially because I do not need firewire 
backend for my platform. That's why the option do not remove freebob 
backend looks better for me. I should say that jackd2 dependencies do 
not allow to build jackd2 without either libfreebob or libffado, so if 
you cross-compile it from source you should keep in mind this.
