Hi TimKa

Is there anything the FFADO project could do to fix this problem?

&gt; So I chosed to cross-compile freebob lib, especially because I do not need
&gt; firewire backend for my platform.

Is your platform using anything on the firewire bus at all?  If not there
would be no need to include the freebob library or the freebob jack backend
in your build.  Could you provide a little more detail on what your platform
is and what it does?  Furthermore, what architecture are you cross compiling
for?

FFADO's dependencies are not all that unusual; I would expect that they
would cross compile without too many difficulties.

The freebob libraries are not maintained and have not been for many years. 
Freebob was renamed FFADO and development continued in the FFADO code base.
By running libfreebob and the freebob jack backend you are in effect
sticking with an extremely old version of the code which only supports a
very small group of devices.  Not only do the newer versions (FFADO) support
many more devices, but there have been many hundreds of bug fixes along the
way.

The last formal freebob release was version 1.0.11 on 11 April 2008.  It is
essentially an unmaintained 6 year old version of FFADO.  I think it would
be a good idea to work through the issues that trip FFADO up on your
platform so you can leave the old freebob library behind.  The FFADO project
would happily evaluate any patches which might be needed to facilitate your
use of FFADO.  At some point it's going to become difficult to compile
the old freebob code (I expect recent C++ compilers will already have
issues).

&gt; I should say that jackd2 dependencies do not allow to build jackd2 without
&gt; either libfreebob or libffado, so if you cross-compile it from source you
&gt; should keep in mind this.

I'm not sure I follow this.  Are you suggesting that jackd2 has no option to
disable the freebob and firewire backends?
