In-Reply-To: TimKa [Jack-Devel] Jack netone problem on AM335x-evmsk board (1400681610.11611_0.ltw:2,a)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack netone problem on AM335x-evmsk board

Yesterday, I tried to use jackd2 and Nettwo and it's working pretty well 
on EVMSK boards, and I didn't find any difficults. Unfortunately for my 
purpose I can't use multicast so Nettwo is not suitable for me. I tried 
to use Netone with jackd2 but also not successful.
On slave I'm running:
jackd -d netone -r 16000
alsa_in -c 2 -d hw:0 -r16000
alsa_out -c 2 -d hw:0 -r16000

On master I'm running:
jackd -d alsa -r16000
  jack_netsource -H <slave_IP>

As a result on master console I start getting following:
...
netjack: at frame 000015 -> total netxruns 1  (6%) queue time= 256000
netjack: at frame 000483 -> total netxruns 14  (2%) queue time= 255848
netjack: at frame 000499 -> total netxruns 30  (6%) queue time= 255848
netjack: at frame 000515 -> total netxruns 46  (8%) queue time= 255848
netjack: at frame 000530 -> total netxruns 61  (11%) queue time= 255848
...
On slave console I start getting following:
(for alsa_in utility)
...
delay = 16027
delay = 18888
delay = 18957
delay = 19023
delay = 17909
delay = 21026
...
(for jackd -d netone)
JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_in was not finished, state = Triggered
JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_out was not finished, state = Triggered
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_in was not finished, state = Triggered
JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_out was not finished, state = Triggered
JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
...
and CPU became highly loaded
