Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Possible removal of deprecated freebob driver?

Sorry for false representation. You are absolutely right, I do need it, 
so I should not recommend anything. Additionally I rechecked building 
procedure and found that now I can't repeat the step when building 
procedure stops because of missing libffado or freebob. Definitely I met 
this situation during building jackd1 or jackd2 from scratch, so may be 
I will work around this later.
