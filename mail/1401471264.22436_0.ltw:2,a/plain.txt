last time this happened, Adi and I began moving the content to
https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki

Back then, we started from an old mysql dump (because mysql + drupal was
broken). Then mysql+drupal was fixed before we've completed the process
and the site was never fully migrated to github-pages. Yet most of it is
already in the wiki there.

github pages are far from the non plus ultra, but they certainly suffice
for the jackaudio.org site. It's all in git and from our POV the
infrastructure maintains itself.

Unless someone comes up with a better idea, I suggests to resume the
migration to gh-pages.

2c,
robin
