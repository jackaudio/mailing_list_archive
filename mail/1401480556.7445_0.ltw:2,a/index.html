Hi!

I'm sure there must be users out there who are familiar with web stuff
and are burning to help their favourite inter-application audio
framework. ;)

Step up, please.


PS: There is also a semi-complete move to GH-pages. If your're familiar
with github, you could be the ideal volunteer. ;)

Cheers

Subject: [Jack-Devel] jackaudio.org website shut down due to hacking

The malicious conscience-free leeches who push pharmaceutical spam managed
to hack into jackaudio.org in a very deep way. They had full access to
everything including the ability to fiddle with MySQL tables (some of
them). I don't consider any part of the Drupal site safe, so I have shut it
down and replaced it with a single static index.html file.

The source tarballs for JACK1 were uncorrupted (probably JACK2 also -
waiting for confirmation from Stephane on this), and I have put up a new
link to the most recent. I also referenced github for the source code
repository and issue tracker.

As someone said on IRC today

   " It's a shame the lead dev has to waste his time coding, answering user
questions AND fixing drupal backdoors "

If someone else wants to volunteer to resurrect the roughly 60 pages of
content that were at jackaudio.org (and realistically, it is probably more
like 20 of real stuff that is needed), get in touch. I can give you full
access to everything you will need.
