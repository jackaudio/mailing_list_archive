Well, trac.jackaudio.org (a.k.a. "the wiki") is still up. OTOH, having
everything on github doesn't sound too bad either.

Anyway, for the time being, I've generated the API reference (doxygen)
and pushed it to

    http://jackaudio.github.io/api/

This URL is also linked from jackaudio's wiki frontpage on github.

If we (or the volunteer(s)) decide to go the GH page route (I'm totally
down for that), all we have to do is to push another file and switch the
DNS:

 
https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages

I also second your suggestion: if nobody else steps up with a better
idea, we move the remaining bits to github. This also encourages
collaboration, if any. ;)
