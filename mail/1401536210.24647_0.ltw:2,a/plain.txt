I'll admit that I was about to volunteer before I realized that it was
drupal, which I don't know anything about and have so far had negative
interest in.

Is there anything that the site needs that a wiki can't provide?  From a
dev perspective, I'm one of those people who worries about putting all
the publicly available eggs in one organizational basket, but github
seems to do better than most.

I should be able to scare up a few people to reassemble the website, if
that is still necessary.
