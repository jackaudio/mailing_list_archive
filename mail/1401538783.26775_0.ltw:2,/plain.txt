My experience with wiki's to date has been fairly negative. I also worry
about putting "all the publically available eggs in one organizational
blanket". We move away from sourceforge for a reason (years ago).

That said, we do know that the jackaudio.org website is a relatively static
one, and that downloads plus 4 sets of informational pages are the key
content. Those 3 are:

    * the FAQ
    * applications list
    * API documentation
    * stuff that was on trac.jackaudio.org (which is a wiki)
