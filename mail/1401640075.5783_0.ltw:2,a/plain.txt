I'd like to volunteer.
I also second the GitHub Page route. Since the wiki-pages are already
available in the markdown format, they (most likely) can be moved into
the generated page. One thing i think is important is to ensure, that
there won't be to much of a lock-in of the page to the GitHub
infrastructure.
I'm thinking about a work flow, using a static site generator. Locally
generated content will be pushed to the github page and the
configuration and content for the generator would also be checked in, so
everyone can collaborate by cloning the repo and sending pull requests.
Do you agree with this?
