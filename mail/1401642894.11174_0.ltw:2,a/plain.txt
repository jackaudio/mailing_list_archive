It does not need to be a public anonymously editable wiki.

That's where git comes into play. It's comparable to the ardour manual site.

github-pages use the same mechanism that ardour.org and
manual.ardour.org uses (jekyll). You'll feel right at home.

You can host it yourself, but then some extra work needs to be done to
integrate the wiki (which is a git repo).

That's doxygen generated HTML anyway.

That's the 'hard' part. A maintenance-free, publicly accessible wiki
with no spam that just integrates with the rest of the site.

Unless someone volunteers to maintain it or someone else pays someone to
maintain it, the option that currently sucks least is the github wiki.
