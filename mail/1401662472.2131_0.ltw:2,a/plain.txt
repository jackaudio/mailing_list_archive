Exactly my thinking. In combination with maybe 1-5 pages on gh-pages. So
far, there's only the doxygen-generated API files that I've pushed. It
could also contain tarballs, if needed.

What else? Nothing that couldn't also go to the gh-wiki.


I'd say we give Markus Seeber access to the gh-pages (Markus, shoot me
your GH name) and let him sort out the details. ACK?

Somebody suggested wordpress, but that's just yet another drupal with a
longstanding track record of security issues, so a clear NACK from my
side.
