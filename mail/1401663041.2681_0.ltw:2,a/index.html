Much appreciated, thanks!

&gt; I also second the GitHub Page route. Since the wiki-pages are already
&gt; available in the markdown format, they (most likely) can be moved into
&gt; the generated page. One thing i think is important is to ensure, that

I think we can keep as much as possible in the gh-wiki. For static HTML,
we can drop files in gh-pages, also the front page.

I don't think there's too much stuff that needs to be in the gh-pages
(see Paul's list and think critically what could also live in the
gh-wiki).


&gt; I'm thinking about a work flow, using a static site generator. Locally
&gt; generated content will be pushed to the github page and the
&gt; configuration and content for the generator would also be checked in, so
&gt; everyone can collaborate by cloning the repo and sending pull requests.
&gt; Do you agree with this?

Sort of. Robin mentioned jekyll. If this fits your bill, then go for it.


As said in the other mail: I suggest to make you responsible (think of
webmaster), and from there, it's totally up to you as long as the constraints
we've just discussed will be met.

If you need help, feel free to ping me/Robin/list any time or team up
with other volunteers from the list. Time frame?  We're not in a hurry,
but something in the ballpark of 1-2 weeks would be great.


Thanks again for taking care!
