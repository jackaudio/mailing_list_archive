Subject:     [Jack-Devel] callbacks on port changes

Hi there,

I would like some software to be notified if any ports/connections 
change within jack. In other words, I have a 'port manager client' which 
I would like notified when new clients create, destrory or connect ports 
to any driver or client.

Are these functions intended to link callbacks in the case of a port 
change :
jack_set_port_rename_callback
jack_set_port_registration_callback
jack_set_port_connect_callback

If they are intended for that, there may be something I am missing ... I 
have hooked them up ... however when I start a client whilst running the 
'port manager client' nothing appears to be triggered.

thanks
Matt
