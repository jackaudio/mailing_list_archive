Forgive me if this seems like a dumb question.  I don't mean it 
facetiously - but wasn't the site backed up anywhere?  Sometimes the 
people who host your site will make regular backups, even if you don't 
make backups yourself.  After all, security is as much their 
responsibility as it is yours.

My own web site got hacked a couple of years ago.  Just like in this 
case, I had absolutely no clue as to how they'd managed to get in. But 
thankfully, I'm a fanatical "backer upper".  All I did was to delete all 
the files on my site and then restore them from a recent backup.  After 
that, I changed my password and (touch wood) it's been fine ever since.
