hi

drupal, wordpress, etc.
in my memories the jackaudio.org size was relatively static, so there's no
strong need for a database and frameworks.

paul, can you dump out the informations of interest in a reasonable format
to read by other tools?

it would be good to have the whole site in a github repository that offers
all the pull/update beauty. pushing a copy of the (verified) static
generated output to jackaudio.org is easy.

the preferred format for the data to render to html would be asciidoc.
easy to write, not a big stack of tools needed to render, well to extend.

if that fits your needs, i'd invest some time to get the existing data
into asciidoc format and help on the deploy scripts.

best regards
tom
