Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Place for bug reporting

Hi everyone,
Because of problems with netone I decided to create my own simple 
network clients and met some bugs on top face of jackd servers. I use 
ARM processor (TI AM335Ñ… platform). I want to report bugs but totally do 
not understand where I can do it? trac.jackaudio.org can not register 
new users, jackaudio.org is shut down and I could not register user 
before shutdown? Any chance to report bugs?
