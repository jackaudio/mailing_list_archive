Dear Leonardo and Adrian, thanks for reply!
I'm very sorry for long following text but I will try to repeat all my 
caveats during experience with jackd for my demo system.
I tried to work with jackd1 and netone and I found next problem:

--------------part of my mail from 21.05-----------
/I have been  cross-comiled jack1 0.124.1 from source and patch time.c, 
because i don't have bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo. I run jackd master and 
slave both on two AM335x-EVMSK boards. When I try to run jackd_netsource 
-H <master_IP> I get a lot of "nextrun amount 21ms" and less 106 or 61ms 
on master console. Unfortunately I can not find any information on Web 
by this issue so trying to find right way by mail list. //
//Additional info: //
//1. I have tried 0.121.2 and 0.124.2 from git, not successful. //
//2. If I place slave role to Ubuntu x86 laptop with jackd 0.121.2 it's 
working pretty well, with out any xruns //
//3. If I place master role to Ubuntu x86 laptop and slave to 
AM335?-EVMSK it's working the same as two AM335?-EVMSK boards //
//4. Standalone jackd on board working well (jackd -d alsa) and I can 
connect input to output and listen music from line-in on line-out 
without xruns //
/--------------end-----------

Unfortunately I do not receive any feedback, so next step I tried jackd2 
and nettwo. It was working pretty well but it's not suitable for me 
because of using multicast.
For third step I was trying to use jackd2 and netone:

--------------part of mail from 22.05-----------
/I tried to use Netone with jackd2 but also not successful. //
//On slave I'm running: //
//jackd -d netone -r 16000 //
//alsa_in -c 2 -d hw:0 -r16000 //
//alsa_out -c 2 -d hw:0 -r16000 //
////
//On master I'm running: //
//jackd -d alsa -r16000 //
// jack_netsource -H <slave_IP> //
////
//As a result on master console I start getting following: //
//... //
//netjack: at frame 000015 -> total netxruns 1  (6%) queue time= 256000 //
//netjack: at frame 000483 -> total netxruns 14  (2%) queue time= 255848 //
//netjack: at frame 000499 -> total netxruns 30  (6%) queue time= 255848 //
//netjack: at frame 000515 -> total netxruns 46  (8%) queue time= 255848 //
//netjack: at frame 000530 -> total netxruns 61  (11%) queue time= 255848 //
//... //
//On slave console I start getting following: //
//(for alsa_in utility) //
//... //
//delay = 16027 //
//delay = 18888 //
//delay = 18957 //
//delay = 19023 //
//delay = 17909 //
//delay = 21026 //
//... //
//(for jackd -d netone) //
//JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_in was not finished, state = Triggered //
//JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_out was not finished, state = Triggered //
//JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error //
//JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_in was not finished, state = Triggered //
//JackEngine::XRun: client = alsa_out was not finished, state = Triggered //
//JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error //
//... //
//and CPU became highly loaded //
/--------------end-----------

I did not get any feedback again, so after these three unsuccessful 
steps I decided to write my own network clients, because it's much more 
clear to understand and debug. So I wrote very simpe send/recv client 
with jitter buffer on receiving side but after some time of proper 
working it's became broken and I start got xruns and high-load of CPU 
again either on sender or receiver. It's very strange for me because 
sender client is very simple, just receiving data, adding header and 
sending to UDP. I start to play with jackd args and found that some of 
combinations send segmentation fault, for example:
jackd -dalsa -r8000 -p128
runs ok, but
jackd -dalsa -r8000 -p128 -n2
send seg. fault
Please note, that in first case jackd runs also with number of periods 
equal to two.
jackd -dalsa -r8000 -p128 -s
also send seg.fault

I tried different options like PREEMPT_RT patch, setting CPU governor to 
performance but no result.

SW environment for last test:
jackd1-0.124.1
linux-3.12 from TI Sitara linux SDK 7.0 with PREEMPT_RT patch
HW environment for last test:
AT335? Starter Kit

So right now I do not have working solution based on jackd and thinking 
about writing my own alsaclient( with similar functionality.
