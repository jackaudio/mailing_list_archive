Hi Chris, thanks for reply!
I have a 720MHz ARM CPU which have only one heavy task (it's jackd). 
Also I patch my kernel to PREEMPT_RT support, change governor to 
performance, change linux interrupt frequency to 1000HZ (SETUP_HZ_1000 
and SETUP_HZ=1000) and recheck CPU frequency (720Mhz). Do you think this 
hardware is not suitable my scheme? With my simple network clients 
(before xruns occur) I have CPU load about 4-5%, but I didn't solve the 
synchronisation task yet, so both ends have own synchronisation (this 
task will be done by jitter buffer and voice detector) and the same 
sample rate. But as I said earlier after software got xrun loop CPU 
became highly loaded so even console is not working properly and I 
forced to reset board. Thanks for your tip I will check sound generator 
with netone and return back.

&gt; The alsa_in and alsa_out clients perform real time resampling in order to
&gt; accomodate the sampling clock differences between the netjack master and
&gt; the local hardware sampling clock.  The error messages show that alsa_in
&gt; and alsa_out are causing the xruns, so likely the processor you have does
&gt; not have the performance needed for real time resampling, or there is
&gt; something in the alsa_in and alsa_out code which does not compile well on
&gt; ARM 32 bit.
&gt;
&gt; You could verify that by removing the need for alsa_in and alsa_out by
&gt; generating audio on the netjack slave rather than using the audio
&gt; hardware, either synthesize audio signals or play back a pre-recorded
&gt; file.
