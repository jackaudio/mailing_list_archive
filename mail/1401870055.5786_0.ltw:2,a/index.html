Any ideas about segmentation fault with jackd1? Because I cann't even 
try to increase number of periods.

&gt; Hi Chris, thanks for reply!
&gt; I have a 720MHz ARM CPU which have only one heavy task (it's jackd). 
&gt; Also I patch my kernel to PREEMPT_RT support, change governor to 
&gt; performance, change linux interrupt frequency to 1000HZ (SETUP_HZ_1000 
&gt; and SETUP_HZ=1000) and recheck CPU frequency (720Mhz). Do you think 
&gt; this hardware is not suitable my scheme? With my simple network 
&gt; clients (before xruns occur) I have CPU load about 4-5%, but I didn't 
&gt; solve the synchronisation task yet, so both ends have own 
&gt; synchronisation (this task will be done by jitter buffer and voice 
&gt; detector) and the same sample rate. But as I said earlier after 
&gt; software got xrun loop CPU became highly loaded so even console is not 
&gt; working properly and I forced to reset board. Thanks for your tip I 
&gt; will check sound generator with netone and return back.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The alsa_in and alsa_out clients perform real time resampling in 
&gt;&gt; order to
&gt;&gt; accomodate the sampling clock differences between the netjack master and
&gt;&gt; the local hardware sampling clock.  The error messages show that alsa_in
&gt;&gt; and alsa_out are causing the xruns, so likely the processor you have 
&gt;&gt; does
&gt;&gt; not have the performance needed for real time resampling, or there is
&gt;&gt; something in the alsa_in and alsa_out code which does not compile 
&gt;&gt; well on
&gt;&gt; ARM 32 bit.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You could verify that by removing the need for alsa_in and alsa_out by
&gt;&gt; generating audio on the netjack slave rather than using the audio
&gt;&gt; hardware, either synthesize audio signals or play back a pre-recorded
&gt;&gt; file.
