I can't find your exact EVM board, but I assume it can run up to 1GHz. 
Did you run these tests with CPU scaling governor in performance mode? I 
see you did in the last tests.

I haven't tried myself but I work on a similar processor and I know 
jackd can consume a lot of CPU power if the period size is low. What is 
the period size you set on the master machine? Anything from 256 up 
should be fine. Remember the period size is imposed by the master.

I assume you run the board headless, just a console, no X, no desktop 
manager, etc...

When XRUNs start to happen all together you get a domino effect and 
nothing will work.

Before moving to this option you may get a look at jacktrip. On my 
system is quite stable, a bit CPU hungry but ok, and very easy to use. 
The 1.0.5 ships with regular Linux distros, the 1.1.0 solves a few bugs.

In case you'd like to go on the ALSA way please remember that you will 
not get synch between ALSA buffers and your application or other 
additional application.
