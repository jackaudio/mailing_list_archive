Hi Adrian, please see below

&gt;&gt; jackd_netsource -H &lt;master_IP&gt; I get a lot of "nextrun amount 21ms"

&gt;&gt; any information on Web by this issue so trying to find right way by
&gt;&gt; mail list. //
&gt; It just means "something is wrong", where "something" could mean
&gt; anything from system tuning to hardware design (who knows if your SoC
&gt; has some crappy design that prevents timely memory access for NIC
&gt; and audio simultaneously?)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I did not get any feedback again, so after these three unsuccessful
&gt;&gt; steps I decided to write my own network clients, because it's much
&gt;&gt; more clear to understand and debug. So I wrote very simpe send/recv
&gt;&gt; client with jitter buffer on receiving side but after some time of
&gt;&gt; proper working it's became broken and I start got xruns and
&gt; Clock drift. I assume you used jackd clients on both sides. Since they
&gt; advance independently, one side will over- or underflow sooner than
&gt; later.
&gt;
&gt; You either need to slave one clock to the sender (this boils down to
&gt; writing another network backend; you could also stick with netjack) or
&gt; resample on the receiving side to the local clock (IIRC that's what
&gt; jacktrip does)
I do not believe that it's clock drift. I have two master clock sides. I 
just send UDP buffers to ethernet on sender side. On receiver side I 
just check availability of data with zero timeout (and read to buffer if 
present) and copy data to out from jitter buffer, also I check for 
jitter buffer overflow, so, as I understand, clock drift is not key for 
my situation. Yes, I currently make sound worse (if my jitter underflow 
or overflow), but I will fix it for next step using voice detector and 
expanding jitter-buffer functions.
&gt;&gt; So right now I do not have working solution based on jackd and
&gt;&gt; thinking about writing my own alsaclient( with similar functionality.
&gt; You're discovering the fundamentals of network audio, most prominently
&gt; clock synchronisation. It really boils down to this.
For VoiceIP (similar to my demo) there are some strategics to work good 
enough even with two master clock sides.
&gt;
&gt; Doing all this on a limited embedded system doesn't exactly help, that
&gt; is why you didn't get any feedback: only few have done this before, and
&gt; those who were successful are most likely selling this stuff by now.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Worse, there is no active netjack dev at the moment, so you're literally
&gt; on your own. There are a couple of patches, but apparently, nobody
&gt; cares. Feel free to familiarize yourself with the subject and become the
&gt; netjack dev, maybe together with Leonardo.
&gt;
&gt; When I say netjack, I mean both incarnations (netjack1, netjack2).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Posting logs of underruns won't get you nowhere, this doesn't even
&gt; qualify as a bug report. A segfault without a stacktrace neither.
Could you please make advise what's enough for bug report?
&gt;
