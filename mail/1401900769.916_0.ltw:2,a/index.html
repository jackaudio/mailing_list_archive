I could end here. There are never two masters. There is exactly one
clock master, everthing else is slaved. If not, you need sample rate
conversion (SRC). As simple as that.

And this is what is happening. Whenever your two "masters" are off by
more than your "jitter buffer" (read: yet another FIFO), you're into
trouble. SRC or clock synchronistation, choose whatever suits your
needs.


&gt; I just send UDP buffers to ethernet on sender side. On
&gt; receiver side I just check availability of data with zero timeout
&gt; (and read to buffer if present) and copy data to out from jitter
&gt; buffer, also I check for jitter buffer overflow, so, as I
&gt; understand, clock drift is not key for my situation.

And what do you do when there is not enough data in the buffer?
Inserting zeroes as needed? Likewise, I guess that you throw away data
if the buffer is full, too. In that case, it should work, you're
essentially doing some poor way of SRC.


Use some debugging information to verify that your buffer always
maintains a valid fill level. In other words, print a warning whenever
it passes a given low/high watermark.

&gt; For VoiceIP (similar to my demo) there are some strategics to work
&gt; good enough even with two master clock sides.

It's called SRC.


&gt; &gt;Posting logs of underruns won't get you nowhere, this doesn't even
&gt; &gt;qualify as a bug report. A segfault without a stacktrace neither.
&gt; Could you please make advise what's enough for bug report?

Let's start with what is not a bug report:

  * "I'm writing my own application, and it's not working."

  * "Whatever I do, it segfaults."


Xruns are not bugs, they are expected error conditions. It's up to the
integration engineer (you) to figure out why they occur. Nobody except
you knows your setup.

If something segfaults, fire up gdb and point out where the problem is
or at least could be. We're talking multithreaded applications here,
it's super easy to create a memory corruption somewhere. In that case,
not even gdb would make sense. valgrind might help, but then again,
you'd need to invoke jackd with a large timeout. Debugging RT
applications is hard.

If gdb is too much to ask for, then at least try to generalise your
problem, try it on a different machine and see if it's really a jackd
problem. It has to be reproducible.



Let's do some expectation management: If you assume that you can pick
two random ARM boards, install Linux and just use jackd to forward some
audio from one board to the other, than this is likely not going to
work. You can start with ordinary UDP streaming via gstreamer/vlc, make
sure to have SRC on the receiving end, and see if that works.

You'll notice that smaller buffers are more likely to cause trouble.
Depending on your needs, you might never reach the desired latency.
There are people with full-blown i7 machines out there who cannot go
below a certain latency because of some obscure system details (graphics
driver, wifi driver, firmware (SMI), IRQ assignment).

As said before: start with large buffers (4k samples) and expect all
kinds of trouble when you go lower. Be scientific, measure, take notes
what is working and what is not. And most importantly: don't expect this
stuff to work out of the box. It's neither a text editor nor a web
radio, it's a real-time application.

And if it xruns, it's not a jackd bug. It's your system that is at
fault. Your only chance is to spend more time in the lab figuring out
why.
