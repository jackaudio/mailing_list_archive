I definitely understand it. I already really appreciate that you discuss 
my problem. I'm ready to investigate by myself, but I need some help 
mainly in navigation because of I'm newbie with jack and AM335х 
platform. I can get support from TI but you know it's very hard to ask 
right question on joint of hardware/OS/system application(jackd)/user 
application(jack clients). That's why I would like to find and write a 
patch or demonstrate problem to TI support or JACK dev group for any 
help on patch. That's why I'm asking about steps to find the problem. 
Right now I fixed problem with segmentation fault on start and aligment 
trap on start (I supposed that it was some cross-compilation problems). 
But still have different problems with stop 
capturing/transferring/playing after few minutes of correct working.
