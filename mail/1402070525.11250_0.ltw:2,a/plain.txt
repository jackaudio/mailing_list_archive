Good news.

Jack 1.9.10 x64 (your second upload? - I downloaded again after your post from the same links an hour ago) works OK on windows 8 x64.

What I believe was causing the crash of anything trying to connect with jack previously :

On my first attempt I installed 1.9.10 on C:\Program Files\Jack\
Then registered the 64bit dll (was the first time Jack was installed on this computer with win8) succesfully.
Apps able to see JackRouter, but crashed on selection.

What I did today and worked :
I installed Jack 1.9.10 x64 on C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\ and registered again the 64bit dll succesfully pointing on (x86) path.

It seems that Jack Installer's pre selection on going to install on 32bit files (C:\Program Files (x86) ) even if it is a 64bit app is the correct path and not the natural 64bit C:\Program Files.
Or was something else ?

Anyway this way it works flawless and smooth. I'm down to -p 128 and -r 96000 and enjoying HQ sound.

Used ok on windows 8? 8.1 ? or 7?

Just came back.. I'll test again with the new ones on win 8 x64, then I'll update to my Jack on win 7 and see what happens
I have Reaper on both computers, so I'll test with too.

New version on same links: tested here on Windows 64 with Reaper : JackRouter is properly found and used.

Please test and report.
