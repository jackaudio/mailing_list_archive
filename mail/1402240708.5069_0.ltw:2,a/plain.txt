Thanks for the quick reply and the patch. I just tried reinstalling the
standard Debian libsndfile packages and Jack2 compiles without a problem.

The reason I was using a later version of libsndfile was that 1.0.25 was
producing occasional floating point exceptions when recording w64 files.
The later version stopped this.

I've now updated libsndfile to the latest git and Jack2 compiles OK with
that too. I should have tried that earlier, but I'd been using the older
git version without problems until now. Sorry for the noise.

John
