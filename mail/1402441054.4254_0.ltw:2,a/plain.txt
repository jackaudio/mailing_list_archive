Subject:     [Jack-Devel] using MIDI controller surfaces with jack. any one that provides feedback?

Hi all,

I am looking for a usb/midi control surface that provides feedback on the
surface.

most surfaces nowadays have some sliders/knobs/pads and usually the pad
buttons are coloured.

Ideally, I would like to be able to control these colours so as to get some
feedback from the application that I program and is being controlled by the
surface.

Is there any such device?

This one (

is
a pretty ideal controller as far as programmable inputs is concerned, but
the pad colours are not assignable.

Is there some other device you know of / worked with ?

thank you in advance for your help and information.
