Some options:

Novation Launchpad gives full control over the pad colors (red, green,
yellow) for feedback, but it's a grid controller only, with no additional
controls. They do have newer models with additional controls, though I have
no idea if they are completely Linux compatible.

From what I can tell Ableton Push should be able to operate in User Mode as
it's a class compliant device, but you may want to verify that. My
understanding is the User Mode allows control over feedback, and hence the
LED colors. Price is a bit high.

The Akai APC40 fills a similar niche, should work out of the box, and is
significantly cheaper than the Push.

Another possible solution is the QuNeo which is much cheaper and class
compliant, though editing presets seems to still require the windows
application. If you want actual knobs or sliders rather than touch
surfaces, this one is not the best option.
