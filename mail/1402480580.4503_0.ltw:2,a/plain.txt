I just bought a Nexus 7 [also] for that purpose, and so I've been
experimenting a bit with the avaible software on Android (most are
avaible for iOS also).

There's TouchOSC which sends OSC and MIDI, though AFAICT only
OSC is useable with a linux server. There's a nice layout editor
written in java with which you can create custom layouts, though I've
found at least one problem: the controls cannot be made to send the OSC
path only, they will always send also a float, so for example you can't
just send "/ardour/transport_play", but it will send
"/ardour/transport_play, 1.0" and ardour won't recognize it. Easily
solvable with pd or python, but still... 

Otherwise there's TouchDAW, which seems to work with Qmidinet on the
linux pc, but I don't know if you can use only the layouts the provide
for you (all for non-linux daws of course) or can roll your own.

And there's also FingerPlayMIDI, which you can recieve midi with on the
linux pc by loading the snd-virmidi module. With this too you can make
your own layouts, which are simple xml files; there's also webapp that
lets you place faders and buttons and generates the xml file.

Regarding OP's feedback question, I *think* TouchOSC features
recieving feedback data, though I'm not 100% positive on it, and I
really don't know about the others. You would then need a DAW that
supports feedback too though, Ardour for example can do it.

My 2 cents: if you go the tablet way you'll certainly find a way to
have a very customizable surface, though having it work smoothly with
the software you want may require a non-zero amount of hacking on
pd/supercollider/python, especially if you want automation feedback to
be displayed on the tablet. But I guess that is true for dedicated
controllers also, since it's not due to something inherent in tablets,
but rather that all this software is meant to use with proprietary
non-linux DAWs, so you have to work your way around it.

cheers,
