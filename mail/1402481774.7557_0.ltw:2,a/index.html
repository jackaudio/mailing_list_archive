I have a QuNeo and like it a lot.  I never fool with editing the presets.  The factory presets cover the interesting modes of operation, and the note values and controller numbers I just learn in my software and modify to do what I wish. 

It definitely supports multicolor (not rgb) feedback on the drum pads, and single-dimension feedback on the sliders and buttons (there are multicolored lights, but you can't control the color on those).

I find the controllers to be very useful, if a bit low-res (all but 1 are just basic MIDI CCs).  The drum pads are quite a bit more sensitive than the typical Akai pads.

Thanks,
Bill Gribble

&gt;&gt; Ideally, I would like to be able to control these colours so as to get some feedback from the application that I program and is being controlled by the surface.
&gt; 
&gt; Some options:
&gt; 
&gt; Novation Launchpad gives full control over the pad colors (red, green, yellow) for feedback, but it's a grid controller only, with no additional controls. They do have newer models with additional controls, though I have no idea if they are completely Linux compatible. 
&gt; 
&gt; From what I can tell Ableton Push should be able to operate in User Mode as it's a class compliant device, but you may want to verify that. My understanding is the User Mode allows control over feedback, and hence the LED colors. Price is a bit high. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Akai APC40 fills a similar niche, should work out of the box, and is significantly cheaper than the Push.
&gt; 
&gt; Another possible solution is the QuNeo which is much cheaper and class compliant, though editing presets seems to still require the windows application. If you want actual knobs or sliders rather than touch surfaces, this one is not the best option.
