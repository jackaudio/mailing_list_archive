Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] using MIDI controller surfaces with jack. any one that provides feedback?

I have a QuNeo and like it a lot.  I never fool with editing the presets.  The factory presets cover the interesting modes of operation, and the note values and controller numbers I just learn in my software and modify to do what I wish. 

It definitely supports multicolor (not rgb) feedback on the drum pads, and single-dimension feedback on the sliders and buttons (there are multicolored lights, but you can't control the color on those).

I find the controllers to be very useful, if a bit low-res (all but 1 are just basic MIDI CCs).  The drum pads are quite a bit more sensitive than the typical Akai pads.

Thanks,
Bill Gribble
