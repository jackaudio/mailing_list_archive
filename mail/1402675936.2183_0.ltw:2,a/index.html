Thank you all very much for your replies.
It seems that a tablet may be more appealing after all (I had not
considered this as an option initially). but the versatility of adding the
right number of knobs / sliders / buttons to fit your needs and have
infinite feedback possibilities is valuable.

Plus it is not much for expensive than an low-to-mid featured surface!

&gt; I have a QuNeo and like it a lot.  I never fool with editing the presets.
&gt;  The factory presets cover the interesting modes of operation, and the note
&gt; values and controller numbers I just learn in my software and modify to do
&gt; what I wish.
&gt;
&gt; It definitely supports multicolor (not rgb) feedback on the drum pads, and
&gt; single-dimension feedback on the sliders and buttons (there are
&gt; multicolored lights, but you can't control the color on those).
&gt;
&gt; I find the controllers to be very useful, if a bit low-res (all but 1 are
&gt; just basic MIDI CCs).  The drum pads are quite a bit more sensitive than
&gt; the typical Akai pads.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt; Ideally, I would like to be able to control these colours so as to get
&gt;&gt; some feedback from the application that I program and is being controlled
&gt;&gt; by the surface.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Some options:
&gt;
&gt; Novation Launchpad gives full control over the pad colors (red, green,
&gt; yellow) for feedback, but it's a grid controller only, with no additional
&gt; controls. They do have newer models with additional controls, though I have
&gt; no idea if they are completely Linux compatible.
&gt;
&gt; From what I can tell Ableton Push should be able to operate in User Mode
&gt; as it's a class compliant device, but you may want to verify that. My
&gt; understanding is the User Mode allows control over feedback, and hence the
&gt; LED colors. Price is a bit high.
&gt;
&gt; The Akai APC40 fills a similar niche, should work out of the box, and is
&gt; significantly cheaper than the Push.
&gt;
&gt; Another possible solution is the QuNeo which is much cheaper and class
&gt; compliant, though editing presets seems to still require the windows
&gt; application. If you want actual knobs or sliders rather than touch
&gt; surfaces, this one is not the best option.
