Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] using MIDI controller surfaces with jack. any one that provides feedback?

Thank you all very much for your replies.
It seems that a tablet may be more appealing after all (I had not
considered this as an option initially). but the versatility of adding the
right number of knobs / sliders / buttons to fit your needs and have
infinite feedback possibilities is valuable.

Plus it is not much for expensive than an low-to-mid featured surface!
