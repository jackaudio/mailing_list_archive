Hi Markus!

Since I pushed the installers initially as a totally uncoordinated move,
feel free to revert to any point you want (nobody is relying on the
files to be present).


Cheers

Subject: [jackaudio.github.com] removing installers from repository (#1)

As discussed with @adiknoth , i will remove the jack installers from the homepage repository, to keep the size of the repository small.

I have prepared a cleaned local repository and removed the last four commits containing the installer files, following this guide:
https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data
This reduced the (compressed) repository size from about 60M back to 2M.

I am ready to force push the changes, but this will revert the history back to: 0707e2b0d92c744fc89e848760246aa9c70b6759

I also have a local backup, but i'd like to have at least one additional OK, to make sure nothing of value is lost in case things go wrong.
