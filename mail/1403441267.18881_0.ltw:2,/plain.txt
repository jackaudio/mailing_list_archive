Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fwd: Re: jackaudio.org website shut down due to hacking

It has been 3 weeks since I "shutdown" jackaudio.org. Although I very much
appreciate the offers of help to get a new site up, things on
https://jackaudio.github.io/ are still severely incomplete. If the folks
involved in getting this up aren't done with it in a couple of days, I will
take on the task myself and just get it done. It is a bit absurd for the
site to be effectively down (still no FAQ, still no downloads (in
particular)) for this long. Please don't think that I don't appreciate the
volunteering and don't understand that sometimes this sort of stuff just
takes time. It is just that in this case, the time to date is too long.
