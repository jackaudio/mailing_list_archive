If that is the preferred way, I will just hack the FAQ in and work on
layout/documentation later, not much of a problem. Regarding the
Downloads/Releases, please upload the files where you want to have them
uploaded (Dropbox, Webspace, GitHub releases, whatever) and contact me,
so I can link them.
Sorry for the lack of communication in from my side, regarding the page.
