Which opens the next question for me: Are you planning on using the old
Webspace (currently jackaudio.org ) for file Uploads? If so, please
consider setting up a sub domain pointing to the old web space
(something like "dl.jackaudio.org") so the files can still be properly
linked, when the "jackaudio.org" finally points to the GitHub page.

Greetings
