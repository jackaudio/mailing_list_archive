I don't actually want github to be the hosting site, even for the web
stuff. I'm not actually against it either, but i thought that the era of
every open source project hosting its site on some repository system died
in the mid-2000's as sf.net became less popular. Personally, I'd prefer a
system similar to what we have for ardour.org where the website is just a
git repo that can be cloned onto any server anywhere and if there is an
httpd-like thing pointed at it .. presto! instant jackaudio.org :)
