Done

Basically you can clone the repository and point your webserver to the
_site directory now. The remaining things are the downloads. As I don't
want to bloat the repository with binary files, I recommend to upload
them separately into _site/downloads/ directory. Afterwards they can be
linked on the page. There may be a more elegant way, but this should do
for now?
