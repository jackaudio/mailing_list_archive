Hi,

I could take this on in case there's still need for a volunteer. I'm a
professional web developer. I'm also in favour of gh-pages, that I use
quite a bit, as long as it's fine for it to be a static site. It's
simple, fast, free, made for open source project sites and it's git so
it works great when different people make changes to the site.

Of course I can't really spend more than about an hour per day on it,
what with my day job and all, but hopefully it's not a massive job and I
think I should be able to get it done in a finite amount of time.

Does this sound reasonable? If so, what would be the next steps?

Micha&#x142;

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure there must be users out there who are familiar with web stuff
&gt; and are burning to help their favourite inter-application audio
&gt; framework. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Step up, please.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; PS: There is also a semi-complete move to GH-pages. If your're familiar
&gt; with github, you could be the ideal volunteer. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers

&gt; Subject: [Jack-Devel] jackaudio.org website shut down due to hacking
&gt; 
&gt; The malicious conscience-free leeches who push pharmaceutical spam
&gt; managed
&gt; to hack into jackaudio.org in a very deep way. They had full access to
&gt; everything including the ability to fiddle with MySQL tables (some of
&gt; them). I don't consider any part of the Drupal site safe, so I have shut
&gt; it
&gt; down and replaced it with a single static index.html file.
&gt; 
&gt; The source tarballs for JACK1 were uncorrupted (probably JACK2 also -
&gt; waiting for confirmation from Stephane on this), and I have put up a new
&gt; link to the most recent. I also referenced github for the source code
&gt; repository and issue tracker.
&gt; 
&gt; As someone said on IRC today
&gt; 
&gt;    " It's a shame the lead dev has to waste his time coding, answering
&gt;    user
&gt; questions AND fixing drupal backdoors "
&gt; 
&gt; If someone else wants to volunteer to resurrect the roughly 60 pages of
&gt; content that were at jackaudio.org (and realistically, it is probably
&gt; more
&gt; like 20 of real stuff that is needed), get in touch. I can give you full
&gt; access to everything you will need.
