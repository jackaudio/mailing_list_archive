Subject:     [LAD] [[hidden]: [Jack-Devel] jackaudio.org website shut down due to hacking]

Hi,

I could take this on in case there's still need for a volunteer. I'm a
professional web developer. I'm also in favour of gh-pages, that I use
quite a bit, as long as it's fine for it to be a static site. It's
simple, fast, free, made for open source project sites and it's git so
it works great when different people make changes to the site.

Of course I can't really spend more than about an hour per day on it,
what with my day job and all, but hopefully it's not a massive job and I
think I should be able to get it done in a finite amount of time.

Does this sound reasonable? If so, what would be the next steps?

Michał
