Running jekyll like:

jekyll build

in the repository root dir, will delete all files in '_site' and
regenerate them with the changes. You may do that on the server, or on a
another machine with jekyll installed and push/pull the Changes backto
the server, after building.
Or just push the changed index.md to the GitHub repo and I will generate
the site and commit back.
The downloads are still the weak point in this system, as they require
manual action...
I'm currently thinking about how to make this easier.
