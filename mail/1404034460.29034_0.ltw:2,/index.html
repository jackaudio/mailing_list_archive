I think this is an unnecessarily complex setup for the downloads.

People have build servers correct, why not give them an ftp account and
they can upload directly to the web server and then the site can have a
small crawler which will crawl the ftp where the downloads are and link
them to the downloads page automatically?

IMHO the downloads should be totally independent from the website so to
speak.

&gt;&gt; Hey Markus what exactly is the issue with the downloads. What are you
&gt;&gt; wanting to achieve in the end.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Basically, I'd like to keep the deployment of the page, as easy as
&gt; possible. (preferably a git clone and done)
&gt;
&gt; Since they are linked in the page, the download files are basically tied
&gt; to the repository. On the other hand, adding binary files of this size
&gt; to a git repository is a bad idea.
&gt;
&gt; Also, in the current state, adding downloadable files requires several
&gt; actions for the one hosting the page:
&gt; 1. Uploadng the File to the webserver
&gt; 2. Modifying the Download page and rebuild the page with jekyll
&gt; 3. Check the links on the page and back to step 2 if something went wrong.
&gt; 4. Commit push the changed download page to the GitHub repository (for
&gt; consistency )
&gt;
&gt; Another problem here is, that the downloadable files are only set up by
&gt; the one hosting the page, so they are outside of teh scope of
&gt; configuration management, meaning you can't host the site, unless you
&gt; have the downloadable files, or to make it short: they are not backed up.
&gt;
&gt; Setting up another repo for just the binary files and including it as a
&gt; submodule may be a solution. Then again you'd still need to run jekyll
&gt; once, before you can deploy, so teh files get copied over into _site .
&gt;
&gt; But I guess I'm already thinking in too difficult ways... ;-)
