I think this is an unnecessarily complex setup for the downloads.

People have build servers correct, why not give them an ftp account and
they can upload directly to the web server and then the site can have a
small crawler which will crawl the ftp where the downloads are and link
them to the downloads page automatically?

IMHO the downloads should be totally independent from the website so to
speak.
