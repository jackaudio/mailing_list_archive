&gt; Hello, I was reading about the possibility of running linux
&gt; (for ARM architecture) alongside android on phones and tablets, by
&gt; creating a chroot environment and using a VNC server on linux and a
&gt; client for android to view the desktop. Many people have done this
&gt; and it seems fairly straightforward, though still enough of a hassle
&gt; to ask beforehand if what I want to do will work: will jack run?
&gt;
&gt; I really don't care about low latency as I would just use it to have
&gt; hydrogen on my tablet (coming to think about it, hydrogen runs on ALSA
&gt; also, but oh well it would be nice to run some other stuff also).
&gt;
&gt; I guess there may be a problem with ALSA not having drivers for the
&gt; tablet's sound card? If that were the problem, installing linux as a
&gt; dual boot instead of chroot would not help, right?
&gt;
&gt; Partially unrelated to my question, I've read this article the other day
&gt; of the upcoming improvements in Android 5.0 audio:
&gt;
&gt; http://geeknizer.com/audio-improvements-in-android-5-0-l-audiophile/
&gt;
&gt; quote:
&gt; "With Android 5.0 comes Audio patch-panel that ensure significantly
&gt; lower input-latency (~20ms) which is not perfect but very usable.
&gt; Output latency and whole audio processing is also accelerated to reduce
&gt; significantly, to enable Real-time audio for the first time"
&gt;
&gt; so will this change the situation? Will we be able to run jack and jack
&gt; apps on android?
&gt;

If you purchase a recent Samsung device you will get access to the
Professional Audio API which is a port of JACK to Android.  Google might
still be convinced to include it as part of hte official android releases
in the future. They already provide a stub for jack in the /external build
directory with android 4.4 (kitkat) but it is of course unpopulated.

You might also be able to run JACK for android on a CM build.

Otherwise you can get hold of an Alllwinner device and compile your own
Android or other Linux OS.

Avoid Rockship unless you are into punishing yourself.

I don't know about other chipsets/manufacturers.
