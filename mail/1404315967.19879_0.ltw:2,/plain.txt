If you purchase a recent Samsung device you will get access to the
Professional Audio API which is a port of JACK to Android.  Google might
still be convinced to include it as part of hte official android releases
in the future. They already provide a stub for jack in the /external build
directory with android 4.4 (kitkat) but it is of course unpopulated.

You might also be able to run JACK for android on a CM build.

Otherwise you can get hold of an Alllwinner device and compile your own
Android or other Linux OS.

Avoid Rockship unless you are into punishing yourself.

I don't know about other chipsets/manufacturers.
