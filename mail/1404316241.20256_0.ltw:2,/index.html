Hi Renato

I've never tried running 'proper' Linux in an Android chroot but, if you do
try that, I expect you'll get much better results by using it in
combination with one of the Android X servers instead of VNC. VNC doesn't
support audio and is pretty sluggish at the best of times.

&gt; Hello, I was reading about the possibility of running linux
&gt; (for ARM architecture) alongside android on phones and tablets, by
&gt; creating a chroot environment and using a VNC server on linux and a
&gt; client for android to view the desktop. Many people have done this
&gt; and it seems fairly straightforward, though still enough of a hassle
&gt; to ask beforehand if what I want to do will work: will jack run?
&gt;
&gt; I really don't care about low latency as I would just use it to have
&gt; hydrogen on my tablet (coming to think about it, hydrogen runs on ALSA
&gt; also, but oh well it would be nice to run some other stuff also).
&gt;
&gt; I guess there may be a problem with ALSA not having drivers for the
&gt; tablet's sound card? If that were the problem, installing linux as a
&gt; dual boot instead of chroot would not help, right?
&gt;
&gt; Partially unrelated to my question, I've read this article the other day
&gt; of the upcoming improvements in Android 5.0 audio:
&gt;
&gt; http://geeknizer.com/audio-improvements-in-android-5-0-l-audiophile/
&gt;
&gt; quote:
&gt; "With Android 5.0 comes Audio patch-panel that ensure significantly
&gt; lower input-latency (~20ms) which is not perfect but very usable.
&gt; Output latency and whole audio processing is also accelerated to reduce
&gt; significantly, to enable Real-time audio for the first time"
&gt;
&gt; so will this change the situation? Will we be able to run jack and jack
&gt; apps on android?
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt; renato
