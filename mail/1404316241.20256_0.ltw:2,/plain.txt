Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jack and linux chroot on android

Hi Renato

I've never tried running 'proper' Linux in an Android chroot but, if you do
try that, I expect you'll get much better results by using it in
combination with one of the Android X servers instead of VNC. VNC doesn't
support audio and is pretty sluggish at the best of times.
