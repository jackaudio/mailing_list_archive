Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Σχετ: latest version of jack 1.9.10 from 2014 does not show midi devices

Hi,

My main problem with the previous version (now I'm getting the latest) was with GrandOrgue 0.3.1.1691

With Jack on, it delayed more than 20 seconds to show up, while with Jack un-installed it opened almost at once (2~3 sec). Also with Jack off, it delayed the same. Possibly while tryin' to locate it to include it on its drivers list, no matter if Jack is on or off.
I have installed both on my Samsung SSD with i7 3230QM at 2.4GHz. Windows 8 x64.

This didn't happen with Kontakt 5.3.1, Reaper 4.62 and Independence pro 3.1 all x64. They work just fine.

My CPU and SSD are lightning fast, also Jack-portaudio loads in 2 sec or less.

I suspect it's a GrandOrgue problem, which hadn't in the past, actually it was the first software I tested with Jack on windows (then 7, 2009) and never encountered this, but I thought would be OK to post here too.

I'll test the latest and post back asap

best
Panos

> Hi Stephane , I am a user of win version of 64 bit jack audio. 1.9.10 from 2013 beta version.  The latest version of 1.9.10 / 2014 version is lower is file size and does not show the midi devices when using the -X winmme command in portaudio.  The 2013 version of 1.9.10 does work fine by showing midi devices in any jack audio connection bay.  I contacted Filipe Coelho, who has windows version of his CARL and CATIA connection bay too and he said i should contact you with my findings.  I re-installed the 2013 version of 1.9.10 for 64bit/jack for windows, and the midi devices showed up again just fine.  I hope this helps fix the current version of 1.9.10 to show the midi devices.  I have screen shots if that would be helpful.  thanks chase
