&gt; &gt; Hey Markus what exactly is the issue with the downloads. What are you
&gt; &gt; wanting to achieve in the end.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, I'd like to keep the deployment of the page, as easy as
&gt; possible. (preferably a git clone and done)
&gt; 
&gt; Since they are linked in the page, the download files are basically tied
&gt; to the repository. On the other hand, adding binary files of this size
&gt; to a git repository is a bad idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, in the current state, adding downloadable files requires several
&gt; actions for the one hosting the page:
&gt; 1. Uploadng the File to the webserver
&gt; 2. Modifying the Download page and rebuild the page with jekyll
&gt; 3. Check the links on the page and back to step 2 if something went wrong.
&gt; 4. Commit push the changed download page to the GitHub repository (for
&gt; consistency )
&gt; 
&gt; Another problem here is, that the downloadable files are only set up by
&gt; the one hosting the page, so they are outside of teh scope of
&gt; configuration management, meaning you can't host the site, unless you
&gt; have the downloadable files, or to make it short: they are not backed up.
&gt; 
&gt; Setting up another repo for just the binary files and including it as a
&gt; submodule may be a solution. Then again you'd still need to run jekyll
&gt; once, before you can deploy, so teh files get copied over into _site .
&gt; 
&gt; But I guess I'm already thinking in too difficult ways... ;-)
&gt; 

At the cost of making things a bit more complex, you can transparently
manage big binary files in git with git-annex. A downside is that it
needs Haskell... I've used it for a while, and I think it might fit
your usecase well.

greetings,
