You couldn't be more wrong. Firstly, there is no master, which renders
your entire message invalid.

Then, JACK moves audio between apps and occasionally from and to
physical ports that may or may not be on the same machine.

Under no circumstances would JACK fiddle with the data itself, that is,
change its volume.

If you want to change some volume, add any of the many JACK mixers into
the signal flow, and you're set. We have a flexible and modular approach
for that, and it's intended behaviour that the user has to ask for
whatever he needs.

You can have this. Subscribe to the graph change callback, see whatever
client outputs to these ports and rewire them through a mixer app
whenever you think it makes sense.


Or don't let feature-incomplete consumer apps output to JACK directly.
Have them output their data via pulseaudio and use pavucontrol to adjust
the volume.
