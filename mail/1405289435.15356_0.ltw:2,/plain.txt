JACK does not interact with the settings of the hardware mixer, and
likewise doesn't offer any global controls. If you want a "master volume"
you need to route via something other than system. Clients that have their
connection behaviour hard-coded are incorrectly designed.

The new metadata API was designed in part to allow users to specify "roles"
for particular ports to address this sort of thing, but since the metadata
API hasn't landed in Jack2 yet, it seems it is still not time to promote
its usage for this purpose.
