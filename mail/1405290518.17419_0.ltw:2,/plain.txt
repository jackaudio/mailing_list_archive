I patched JACK2, extended API and command line tools to allow easily 
controlling volume per port, which I find very handy. However IIRC it was 
criticized of breaking the generalized design concept of JACK.

Another extension I find very handy is integrated peak measurement per port 
upon on request (that is can be switched on/off for performance reasons).

Those two things being supported i.e. in qjackctl would make connection setups 
much more convenient. Because you can i.e. immediately *see* "here is a 
signal, there not" and you wouldn't have to deal with a separate application 
just for trivial mixing tasks.

Best regards,
