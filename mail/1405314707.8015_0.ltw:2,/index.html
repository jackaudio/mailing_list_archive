&gt; &gt; a master volume fader is missing in JACK. Some audio interfaces don't
&gt; 
&gt; You couldn't be more wrong. Firstly, there is no master, which renders
&gt; your entire message invalid.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, JACK moves audio between apps and occasionally from and to
&gt; physical ports that may or may not be on the same machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Under no circumstances would JACK fiddle with the data itself, that is,
&gt; change its volume.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to change some volume, add any of the many JACK mixers into
&gt; the signal flow, and you're set. We have a flexible and modular approach
&gt; for that, and it's intended behaviour that the user has to ask for
&gt; whatever he needs.

This would be a kind of a mixer application that watches clients
connecting to system/playback_1 &amp; 2, disconnects them, reconnects them
to its own input while itself outputting to system/playback_1 &amp; 2.

Additionally, ALSA and Pulse clients could be redirected to the mixer
via .asoundrc and jack audio sink in Pulseaudio.

Sure it can be done on application level. It would be easier if
there was a system/send_1 &amp; 2 (readable) and a system/return_1 &amp; 2
(writable) that are connected by default (or not, depending on an option
switch). This way a master volume application wouldn't have to
change other clients' connections.
