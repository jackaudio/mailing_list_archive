This would be a kind of a mixer application that watches clients
connecting to system/playback_1 & 2, disconnects them, reconnects them
to its own input while itself outputting to system/playback_1 & 2.

Additionally, ALSA and Pulse clients could be redirected to the mixer
via .asoundrc and jack audio sink in Pulseaudio.

Sure it can be done on application level. It would be easier if
there was a system/send_1 & 2 (readable) and a system/return_1 & 2
(writable) that are connected by default (or not, depending on an option
switch). This way a master volume application wouldn't have to
change other clients' connections.
