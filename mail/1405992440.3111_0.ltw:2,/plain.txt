Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] filtering for jack net clients

OK I understand.

Here is the problem. We have a jack server running on a remote computer. 
It is running some form of netjack.
My computer running a netjack driver connects to it and wants to play or 
acquire audio. It can't because the ports aren't connected to anything.
A solution to this problem is to run a client for port monitoring on the 
remote computer which autoconnects netjack clients.

Are there other solutions ?

Matt
