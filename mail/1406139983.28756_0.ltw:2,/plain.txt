Yes. Jan Middelkoop was facing the same problem when he set up his
jackd-based radio station.

IIRC, he simply sshed into the remote machine (use keylogins for that)
and ran jack_connect from a script. Since the ports were already
known in advance, this wasn't too hard to do.

If your port names are dynamic, either try to make them static (you have
the source, right?) or parse the output of jack_lsp to match the correct
ports.
