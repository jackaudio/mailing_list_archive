&gt;&gt; Here is the problem. We have a jack server running on a remote
&gt;&gt; computer. It is running some form of netjack. My computer running a
&gt;&gt; netjack driver connects to it and wants to play or acquire audio. It
&gt;&gt; can't because the ports aren't connected to anything. A solution to
&gt;&gt; this problem is to run a client for port monitoring on the remote
&gt;&gt; computer which autoconnects netjack clients.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are there other solutions ?
&gt;
&gt; Yes. Jan Middelkoop was facing the same problem when he set up his
&gt; jackd-based radio station.
&gt;
&gt; IIRC, he simply sshed into the remote machine (use keylogins for that)
&gt; and ran jack_connect from a script. Since the ports were already
&gt; known in advance, this wasn't too hard to do.
&gt;
&gt; If your port names are dynamic, either try to make them static (you have
&gt; the source, right?) or parse the output of jack_lsp to match the correct
&gt; ports.
&gt;
&gt;

Thanks for the info Adrian. I am trying to avoid ssh and command line 
access, I am thinking of compiling the GUI I have with GTK3 and serving 
that for a web browser using broadway.
For now ...
I have implemented a method to autoconnect slave ports :
http://www.flatmax.org/gtkiostream/html/classJackPortMonitor.html#a00f85028bc5f1e6058d7f86626f1e056

I think it would be far better if we defined a reserved keyword for 
these ports (currently _slave_ but not reserved) ... we could have it 
defined in the header files. Similarly for the system client name 'system'.

Is the community willing to reserve names for network client ports and 
also the client name for the physical system ?
