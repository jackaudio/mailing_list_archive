Thanks for the info Adrian. I am trying to avoid ssh and command line 
access, I am thinking of compiling the GUI I have with GTK3 and serving 
that for a web browser using broadway.
For now ...
I have implemented a method to autoconnect slave ports :
http://www.flatmax.org/gtkiostream/html/classJackPortMonitor.html#a00f85028bc5f1e6058d7f86626f1e056

I think it would be far better if we defined a reserved keyword for 
these ports (currently _slave_ but not reserved) ... we could have it 
defined in the header files. Similarly for the system client name 'system'.

Is the community willing to reserve names for network client ports and 
also the client name for the physical system ?
