Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Streaming more than 2 channel audio through jack?

Hello everyone,

I have a simple setup, where a Pure Data patch (or in fact any jack-compatible sound source) streams 2 or more channel audio from OSX / linux machine to iOS clients.

My problem is that I need to wirelessly route each channel to each of the clients (where 1 client receives only 1 channel). Is it possible to do via jack? For instance, something like an iOS wrapper for netjack or jacktrip would have been perfect, but as far as I know they are only OSX/linux compatible.

Alternatively, is it possible to setup a jack-compatible streaming server with multiple audio streams, and get a mounting point for each channel separately?

Thanks in advance,
Bektur
