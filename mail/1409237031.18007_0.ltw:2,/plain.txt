I meant to say the dummy driver not the alsa dummy driver. In case it is
of interest I am trying to track down the cause of the following error so
I thought softmode might be useful in this case.

subgraph starting at jack-smf-player timed out (subgraph_wait_fd=16,
status = 0, state = Triggered, pollret = 0 revents = 0x0)


- I don't see it in the server flags or the dummy driver flags but I do
see it in the alsa driver flags.
