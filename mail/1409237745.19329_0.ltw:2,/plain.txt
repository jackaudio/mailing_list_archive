ah, *that* softmode.

the answer is that softmode relates to xrun handling, and the dummy driver
nevers gets xruns.

xruns are not the same as conditions where a client takes too long,
measured by some metric, which is what is happening in your case.
obviously, clients taking too long can *lead* to xruns, but softmode in the
ALSA driver just affects how it responds to reports of xruns from ALSA
itself. since the dummy backend has no such concept ... no softmode.
