Thanks for that explanation.

The app I am using loads a midi file and triggers the timeout error while
loading the file or just after starting playback (upto 200ms). However the
issue is happening randomly. Sometimes the same file loads and plays just
fine and sometimes the app triggers the error.

As the dummy driver is not affected by xruns is there an easy/obvious way
to identify the actual cause of the delay that is triggering the subgraph
timeout error?

I have tried extending the periods upto -p 4096 but that is not helping.
With varying period rates I I can run the app for a few hours and other
times it triggers the timeout error after a few minutes.

Could it be related to the other apps in the processing graph or is it
most likely an internal issue to the application that is causing the
error.
