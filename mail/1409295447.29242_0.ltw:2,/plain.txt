In this case the issue appears not to be related to xruns as the dummy
driver doesn't do that.

Does jackdmp provide details on subgraph timeout issues? I presume it
would only see them when they happen rather than predict that they might
happen.

What does this error message imply exactly:

subgraph starting at jack-smf-player timed out (subgraph_wait_fd=16,
status = 0, state = Triggered, pollret = 0 revents = 0x0)

Are there specific details I can print in the app or in the jack error
message to assist with identifying the cause of the delay?
