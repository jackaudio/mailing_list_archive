Subject:     [Jack-Devel] issue with capturing

Hi all,

I am developing a driver for a TI audio chip and have got the playback part
working, but when I enable capturing ports I am unable to create clients.
Some output:

Playback only:
# jackd -d alsa -d hw:0 -P &
# jackdmp 1.9.10

# jack_lsp

system:playback_2

Both capturing and playback:

Driver is not running

CheckSize error size = 32 Size() = 12

Any ideas why the lock can't be acquired? Jack is always capturing, how to
get clients to work with the captured data?

Thanks in advance,
With kind regards,

Pieter
