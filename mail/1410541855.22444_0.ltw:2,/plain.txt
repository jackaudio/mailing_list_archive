Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JackD Issues "Checksize errors"

Dwar Members

i suppose this is not the "right" place to talk about my issue, but as 
it seems to be a "rather new one",
i'd like to place it here.


i am using JackD 1.9.10 in combination with Ardour 3.5.357 and two 
Hoontech DSP2000/DC-DAC2000 cards (ICE1712 Chipset) merged with a custom 
.asoundrc, on Ubuntu Studio 12.04 with Kernel 3.14.04. After running 
Ardour / JackD for a couple of minutes JackD throws a large amount of 
the following errors  (until it shuts down by itself, usually somewhere 
between one hour or so). The audio functionality itself is ok.

Choosing different sampling rates between 44.1K up to 96K makes no 
difference, even not increasing/decrease periods/buffer size on JackD, 
or sync one card to the other one via SP/DIF (which i usually do). I had 
this issue on different hardware platforms (on an "old" Phenom 9850 
Quad-Core and actually on a Intel Q6600 Quad-Core running at Standard 
frequency, not overclocked). Playing around with the CPU governor has 
also no effect.

I cannot figure out the cause of this error, no matter what i try :(


Kind regards
Stef
