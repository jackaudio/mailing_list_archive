Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Capture/mix the audio output/input on OSX and stream with libshout

Hi everybody,

I'm new on the list.

I'm developing an application on OSX that needs to capture all the audio on a given output device and to stream it to a web hosting server with libshout. Actually, I already can play and stream an mp3 file to a web hosting server but I don't know hot to (for instance) capture the input from a mic line and mix it with the buffer that I'm streaming.

Still,

when I try to compile jackosx, I get missing include file error in xCode (please see the screenshot attached below).

Can anybody help me?

Cheers

Dodo

P.S. I'm using C/C++ language with gnu compiler.
