Oops - one other thing....

When the crash happens for you, does it make any difference which audio 
I/O Jack is trying to use?  For example, does it only happen with a 
specific driver (e.g. the sound driver for some particular card)?

Here's the reason I'm asking...  one VERY common problem we've had on 
Windows is where a customer upgrades their PC (e.g. they buy a 64-bit 
machine when they'd previously been using a 32-bit machine). Then they 
take the audio card out of their old machine and swap it into their new 
machine - installing their old sound card driver (without realising that 
it's 32-bit!!)  This has been the cause of many spurious crashes!!

Just a thought...

John
