Here we go, some output:


Start Jack, USB device is already plugged in:

...
Not shown: Early startup stuff, we pick it up at last USB midi port...
...

JackALSARawMidiDriver::Attach - output port registered 
(name='system:midi_playback_2', alias='system:2-1 MidiSport 2x2 2 out').
Jack: JackEngine::PortRegister ref = 2 name = system:midi_playback_3 type = 8 
bit raw midi flags = 21 buffer_size = 256
Jack: JackGraphManager::AllocatePortAux port_index = 28 name = 
system:midi_playback_3 type = 8 bit raw midi
Jack: JackConnectionManager::AddInputPort ref = 2 port = 28
Jack: JackEngine::ClientNotify: no callback for notification = 9

JackALSARawMidiDriver::Attach - output port registered

out').
Jack: JackServer::Start
Jack: JackThreadedDriver::Start
JackALSARawMidiDriver::Start - Starting 'alsarawmidi' driver.
JackALSARawMidiDriver::Start - starting ALSA thread ...

Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 1 fd = 29
Jack: JackRequest::Notification
Jack: JackDriver::ClientNotify ref = 1 driver = freewheel name = freewheel

Jack: JackDriver::ClientNotify ref = 1 driver = freewheel name = freewheel

Jack: JackEngine::ClientNotify: no callback for notification = 4

Jack: JackEngine::ClientNotify: no callback for notification = 4

...
Idle

Now unplug USB device:

JackALSARawMidiPort::GetIOPollEvents - the file descriptor is invalid.
JackALSARawMidiDriver::Execute - a fatal error occurred while processing ALSA 
output events.
JackALSARawMidiDriver::Execute - ALSA thread exiting.
Jack: JackPosixThread::ThreadHandler : exit
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 1 fd = 29

...
Idle
...

Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 1 fd = 29
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 1 fd = 29

...

Now re-plug USB device:

No output, nothing changes.

...


Thanks. Tim.
