D'oh! Just a few days ago. And I read it.
From the current discussion in LAD  "Bridging alsa and jack midi":

Sorry about that.
Came upon this problem in a haphazard way, was too focused on it.
Great stuff! Thanks.

No really, this is so ironic. 

Weeks ago someone made a simple request for an option in MusE.

I began to add it, then realized MusE has been missing something a long time:
Persistent ports.
That is, unplug and re-plug a device and we automatically reconnect to it. 
I cache the port names and use them to match up with the re-appearing ports.

But that's when I began investigating how Jack drivers name their ports.
There's trouble.

Side note:
Please please, don't add numbers in the port names, like alsa addresses.
And please don't ever use an auto-incrementing numbering scheme
 like in the alsa raw and seq drivers.
Each time the device is re-plugged, it gets a new name!
Canonical schemes are fine but this cannot be satisfied for alsa midi.
Actually because of that, I think canonical scheme needs to be abandoned.
Look at it this way: You're going to have to do something about port names 
 if you deprecate aliases in favour of the metadata because it would make
 no sense having some drivers use canonical names and others full names
 already similar to the metadata.
The most sensible names I saw so far were the two aliases for the seq driver.
If a user sees two identical port names due to identical cards, it is up to 
 them to fix the problem at the source - using udev device re-naming which 
 I just learned about. 

So anyway, I looked at the drivers and bridges out there.
At the same time I followed the LAD thread on "Bridging alsa and jack midi".
Where Paul talked about the new alsamidi driver, and metadata.
Ironically it's that thread which led me to try the alsarawmidi driver,
 being a Jack2 user.

So I fired up alsarawmidi and what did I see? As I said in my first post:

See the irony? "Wow, Jack added my Persistent Ports idea!" 

Also ironic that persistent ports are discussed briefly on the Jack site.
It says very few clients do this kind of thing. I think port naming is why.
It mentions session managers. Should a session manager deal with this 
 reconnect stuff? If so, why - everything I need is in normal Jack itself, no?
And not even a session manager could deal with bad port naming/reordering.

Anyway I feel better now knowing more about metadata :-)

I think drivers should fill in 'hardware' and maybe 'pretty name' with 
 default values. And as above, if numbers such as midi indexing are 
 desired they should be made separate properties since they might 
 change day to day.

Question: Some metadata such as the 'hardware' property might be 
 crucial and should not change.
How about adding a read-only 'lock' to metadata?

As usual I'm either waaay off or just off.
Thanks for listening, thanks for your help. Good weekend to all.
Tim.
