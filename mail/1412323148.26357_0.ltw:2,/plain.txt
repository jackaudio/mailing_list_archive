I thought Paul said the new jack1 driver just needed to be ported to jack2
as an internal client.  I wasn't paying close attention, but I thought he
said something about it already being in git, someone just needed to
integrate to jack2.   I probably missed a lot of necessary details that go
along with that since I wasn't paying attention, but seems like that would
be the place to start rather than trying to band-aid the old hacks.
