Er, I think. That is after researching and experience, but no proof yet.
Instead libpthread could simply be missing from linker lines.

I tried modifying the waf script, ng but I should study waf more.
I tried dropping in a newer waf program (the one from Jack)
 but I guess those things are customized, and compressed python?
Can't seem to find an actual makefile.

And how does my distro deal with this each distro release, if I can't?
If libpthread is simply missing from linker lines, maybe an environmental flag.

Tim.
