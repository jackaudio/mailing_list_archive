Hi Tim,

That's because the driver doesn't detect new devices.  It looks at the
devices that are connected when you start JACK, and assumes that those
are the devices that will be used.  I took this approach when I wrote
the driver because, at the time (it may still be this way), there
wasn't an elegant way to detect new devices using ALSA's rawmidi
interface.  I believe the ALSA sequencer interface has an event
mechanism for new devices; the rawmidi interface, in contrast, has no
such mechanism.

I'm not surprised that the ports don't disappear, but I am surprised
that there isn't a bunch of (poll-related) error messages that flood
your JACK console.

I'm happy to help brainstorm on ideas about how to best solve the
problem.  I can't guarantee that I'll find time to actually fix the
problem if and when a reasonable solution pops up.

Thanks,
