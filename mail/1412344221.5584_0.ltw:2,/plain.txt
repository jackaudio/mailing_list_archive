"pretty name" could only be meaningfully set by a backend that can talk to
some layer that knows that (eg.) channel 26 of an RME HDSP device is
"S/PDIF R". ALSA does not provide this information, CoreAudio does. Thus if
you want this functionality on Linux, it isn't available.

I set my HDSP channel names with this script:

--------------

#!/bin/sh

#
# set up nice names for all the ports
#

for n in `seq 1 24` ; do
    jack_property -p -s system:playback_$n
http://jackaudio.org/metadata/pretty-name "ADAT $n"
    jack_property -p -s system:capture_$n
http://jackaudio.org/metadata/pretty-name "ADAT $n"
done
jack_property -p -s system:playback_25
http://jackaudio.org/metadata/pretty-name "S/PDIF L"
jack_property -p -s system:capture_25
http://jackaudio.org/metadata/pretty-name "S/PDIF L"
jack_property -p -s system:playback_26
http://jackaudio.org/metadata/pretty-name "S/PDIF R"
jack_property -p -s system:capture_26
http://jackaudio.org/metadata/pretty-name "S/PDIF R"

# and now the driver itself

jack_property -c -s system http://jackaudio.org/metadata/pretty-name "RME
HDSP"

exit 0

-------------------------

The "hardware" property is something I don't remember very well, but with
the memory I have of it, it suffers from the same problem: on Linux the
device driver cannot/does not provide the information required to set it.

No metadata/properties should be considered "crucial".
