Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack2 ASIO & autostart

Hi Stephane. Hi jack2-devs.

In a recent foray into the windows-world, I noticed that that when
installing jack2, it registers JackRouter.dll ASIO dll. So far so good.

When starting some ASIO application that scans for available devices and
if jackd is not running, JackRouter.dll tries to launch jackd during
ASIO device scan. Not good.

jackd's auto-start timeout is about 1 min which makes this rather
unusable. See http://pastebin.com/Jug8HqdF for a complete log.
It takes twice that time if ASIO4all is installed which probes
JackRouter again.

Here, jackd auto-start fails because jackd on win7 64bit installs itself
to C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack\jackd.exe (note the x86) -- but even if
jackd autostart is made to work, jackd blocks the device which one may
want to use directly with ASIO and causes further issues...

Current workaround: start jackd with the dummy backend before launching
an ASIO app, or uninstall jack.

Proposed solution: use JackNoStartServer in JackRouter (patch attached).

ciao,
robin
