Subject:     [Jack-Devel] port disconnection callbacks (JackPortConnectCallback)

Hi there,

I have registered a callback for port (dis)connections.

When my client connects its ports, the JackPortConnectCallback indicates 
this occurance with the 'connect' variable = 1

When my client finishes playing, it stops by returning a non-zero number 
from the audio processing function. If I stop the client in this manner, 
then my JackPortConnectCallback doesn't get called.

I can see that the port has been disconnected from the client's inputs 
and outputs.

I would expect that when the system disconnects those ports it calls the 
JackPortConnectCallback with the 'connect' variable = 0

Is this the expected behaviour ?

Here is the version info :
jackdmp 1.9.10

thanks
Matt
