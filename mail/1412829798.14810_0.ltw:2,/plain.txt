Subject:     [Jack-Devel] netjack2 on cygwin

Hi there,

I am trying to compile jack2 netjack on cygwin.

After manually compileing celt and opus, I am now having troubles with 
standard compilation in the windows directory ... and other stuff.

For example the JackAtomic asm stuff is troublesome !

Has anyone managed to compile netjack for cygwin ?

thanks
Matt
