This is not clear for me if this is suppose to happen

What happens in the current jack2 implementation is that the RT thread is stopped, the client is marked "inactive", and this is probably what make the connecting begin inactive also.

Since this happens on in library side for now (RT thread is stopped) there isn't anything in place to "signal" back the sever for what happens.

Probably we are in the "grey zone" here which means : something not completely well specified/designed/implemented.
