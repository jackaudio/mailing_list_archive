they don't use a process callback.

stephane, this behaviour seems clearly wrong to me. given that a client
without a process callback can receive the connect/disconnect callbacks, it
doesn't seem right that a client which has just returned non-zero from its
process callback would simply stop receiving them. does that seem right to
you?

i thought jack2 delivered all non-process callbacks in a separate thread?
