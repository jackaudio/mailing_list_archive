Let me try to understand a little of what's going on here ....

Is the original problem that the real time thread (which processes 
audio) is receiving a non-zero return from a client - which indicates to 
stop processing that client. At this point, the client's ports are 
disconnected by the real time thread.

The non-realtime thread is the one which executes port (dis)connection 
callbacks ... this non-realtime thread has no way of knowing that the 
real time thread has had a client change.
