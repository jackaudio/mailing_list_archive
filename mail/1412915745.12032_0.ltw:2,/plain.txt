Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] netjack2 on cygwin

I tried a rough compile of code against the distributed binaries.
I couldn't get the linker to understand the static .lib files.
I think that the distributed binaries are not compiled with the same 
compiler which is distributed with cygwin. For that reason linkage problems.

Using waf requires some fiddling ... first of all, waf detects cygwin as 
a CYGWIN platform and with some fiddling of the wscript, it is possible 
to get it to recognise it as windows.

I tried two different ways of compiling. Once as a posix system which 
clearly didn't work as some fundamental system level functions just 
aren't available in the cygwin libc system.
The other way I tried was as a windows system, however the cygwin 
compiler couldn't understand the asm code. It simply couldn't compile it.
