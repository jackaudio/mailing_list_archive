Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] netjack2 on cygwin

I now have jack compiling under cygwin.

I have started debugging.
I am getting problems with something as innocent as the following 
(JackControlAPI.cpp):
jackctl_add_driver_parameters( ...){
...
        switch (descriptor_ptr->type)
         {
...
         case JackDriverParamUInt:
             jackctl_type = JackParamUInt;     <==== segfault here
...

JackParamUInt is nothing other then an enum.
jackctl_type is of the same type.

Any ideas ?
