Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] netjack2 on cygwin

Still debugging ... looking for ideas/help...

I can now run the cygwin jackd server ... trying to run with just the 
dummy backend.

When I run, the system is hanging in JackClientSocket::Connect.
The hang point is the socket connect call.

I have checked with the firewall down and the same problem.

To get this system running I had to enable the cygserver service to 
bring up the shm and other unix related software systems.

Is it possible that a server thread isn't listening ?
