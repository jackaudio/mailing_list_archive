Subject:     [Jack-Devel] starting jack from within a bash script

hi all,
I want to start jack from a bash script and I am not sure how can I wait to
make sure that jack has started to do all the next operations.
right now and on any jack related script I came across on the internet, I
see "sleep" statements after execution of jackd. so smth like

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/jackd ... &
sleep 3
#init other apps and do connections

This is quick and easy but not a "safe" way to start everything else after
jack for obvious reasons.
Is there a way to wait for jack to start and then continue with the
execution of the script?

thank you
