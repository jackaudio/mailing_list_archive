Subject:     [Jack-Devel] a command line midi controller mixer for jack?

hello everyone,
I am setting up a headless master audio workstation.
what I want is upon boot to start the jack server (and netmanger) , some
applications and do a few connections between them.
now the connections are easy to do with jack_connect , but I would like to
insert a mixer in the middle of all these connections and control sound
levels and routing from a midi controller, in fact the controller will be
the BEHRINGER BCR2000.

It is possible to use jack_mixer as a mixer but it does not offer command
line operation and I would have to have a vnc server running in order to
fire it up. Is there another application suited for this specific situation?

thank you for your help
