..or some dummy X-server, xvfb for example.

hardour [1] - the headless version of ardour3 comes to mind.

You prepare an Ardour3 session (mixer mappings, plugins, BCR control
mappings etc) on a machine with desktop. Then copy that session to the
headless machine and load it in hardour.

ecasound [2] may be an option as well, but I don't know how easy or
otherwise it is to bind BCR2K controls to it.


Other than those, there are a few hackable solutions possible: Pure
Data [3] for example (Pd can run headless). A small supercollider [4]
or csound [5] script can do the trick as well. Most elegant is
probably FAUST (compiled to standalone jack app) [6]. Personally I'd
probably use supercollider: easy and quick to do midi bindings and
very reliable.

Also writing a small jack client that just does gain adjustments is
not too hard and there's probably some almost ready code out therein
some drawer that would work with minor adjustments if you don't mind
getting your hands a bit dirty.

HTH,
robin
