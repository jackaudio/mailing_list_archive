Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] problem with libjack-dev

Tnx Adrian,

Your hit the nail on the head but I think my system has more problems,
It went on and on with "No package found" like libsamplerate, 
pygobject-2.0 and so on.

know any more yes I can install every package he is asking for but what 
do I mis more?
HELP please
