Subject:     [Jack-Devel] (no subject)

 I am trying to use jack in the MIDI protocol under Windows 8.1.
Before all 
following the tutorial in
<http://jackaudio.org/faq/jack_on_windows.html>  
I added: <"-X winmme"> in the "Server Path"
in QJackCtl setup The tutorial 
doesn't explain well (I am really
a beginner) where to insert this expressi
on; I inserted it in the
last row of setup men√π in the server suffix field (betwen quotation
marks or no ?) It's proper ? But none MIDI application appear as
client in jack. Could you help me ?
thanks
