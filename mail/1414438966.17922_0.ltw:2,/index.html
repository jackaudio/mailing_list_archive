&gt;&gt; Hi,

&gt;&gt; Some applications are using signals() and the jack client needs to
&gt;&gt; ignore these. Consequently read/write calls should be wrapped. See
&gt;&gt; attached patch. Can this be put upstream? Probably same issue with jack2.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; JACK is a *realtime* audio system, if application code changes the
&gt; behavior so that jack read/writes to be interrupted by a EINTR, it
&gt; really seems something is broken by design there.
&gt;
&gt; signal() is sent to the main process thread. It should not be able to
&gt; affect the jack-process callback thread at all. (Marking the jack thread
&gt; as TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE could be a way forward or explicitly using
&gt; pthread_sigmask() - but those are hacks and workarounds).
&gt;
&gt; Either way I cannot reproduce the problem in the first place, jltcgen
&gt; from https://github.com/x42/ltc-tools uses SIGHUP to re-sync and that
&gt; never caused issues here with jack2 on various architectures.

Hi,

I have a QT4/5.x based application using JACK, and this is a race. On 
one machine the issue never triggered. On another it happens from time 
to time, and prevents the JACK-client from registering. Have have not 
seen a problem in the jack-process callback thread yet, but when the 
register call is done from the main() thread. Initially I thought there 
was a problem with jackd, and I did a "strace" / "ktrace" and the 
problem went away.

QT4/5.x has similar wrappers around its read/write operations.
