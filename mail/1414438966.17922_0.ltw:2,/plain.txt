Hi,

I have a QT4/5.x based application using JACK, and this is a race. On 
one machine the issue never triggered. On another it happens from time 
to time, and prevents the JACK-client from registering. Have have not 
seen a problem in the jack-process callback thread yet, but when the 
register call is done from the main() thread. Initially I thought there 
was a problem with jackd, and I did a "strace" / "ktrace" and the 
problem went away.

QT4/5.x has similar wrappers around its read/write operations.
