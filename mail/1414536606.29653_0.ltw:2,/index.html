hi all,
thank you for your responses.
I have looked through all the options - none is easy as a plugin ready to
be installed and run immediately. So I will have to invest some time in to
learning one or another tool.

ecasound / supercollider / pure data: do they offer a way to loadup a gui
front end and be able to see the current levels that the midi mixer has at
any given time? The idea is of course to be able to set the levels of the
headless audio server, but at the same time be able to see them all if
needed...

thank you .

PS: I would continue this discussion in jack-users mail list, but It has
been 3 days at this point that I have not had a reply with a confirmation
link to join that mailing list. If anyone of the moderators sees this,
please advise :)

&gt; I'd suggest ecasound too.
&gt; The midi mappings for the commands can be defined in a .ecs config file
&gt; that you start ecasound with.
&gt; Take a look at the website or manpage and you will quickly find out. I can
&gt; assist if you want.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; hello everyone,
&gt;&gt; I am setting up a headless master audio workstation.
&gt;&gt; what I want is upon boot to start the jack server (and netmanger) , some
&gt;&gt; applications and do a few connections between them.
&gt;&gt; now the connections are easy to do with jack_connect , but I would like
&gt;&gt; to insert a mixer in the middle of all these connections and control sound
&gt;&gt; levels and routing from a midi controller, in fact the controller will be
&gt;&gt; the BEHRINGER BCR2000.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is possible to use jack_mixer as a mixer but it does not offer command
&gt;&gt; line operation and I would have to have a vnc server running in order to
&gt;&gt; fire it up. Is there another application suited for this specific situation?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thank you for your help
