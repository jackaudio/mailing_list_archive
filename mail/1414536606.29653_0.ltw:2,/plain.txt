Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] a command line midi controller mixer for jack?

hi all,
thank you for your responses.
I have looked through all the options - none is easy as a plugin ready to
be installed and run immediately. So I will have to invest some time in to
learning one or another tool.

ecasound / supercollider / pure data: do they offer a way to loadup a gui
front end and be able to see the current levels that the midi mixer has at
any given time? The idea is of course to be able to set the levels of the
headless audio server, but at the same time be able to see them all if
needed...

thank you .

PS: I would continue this discussion in jack-users mail list, but It has
been 3 days at this point that I have not had a reply with a confirmation
link to join that mailing list. If anyone of the moderators sees this,
please advise :)
