&gt; 3. hack Jack to allow bypassing the whole thing
&gt; I've chosen 3, the formers do no really reserve anything anyway as the
&gt; buses are not connected to each other. By passing the
&gt; JACK_NO_AUDIO_RESERVATION environment variable I can now disable the
&gt; audio_acquire/audio_release callbacks.
&gt;

basically, jack1 :)


&gt;
&gt; The first solution that comes to mind is to make this system-wide server
&gt; run in promiscuous mode, so I've exported JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER globally
&gt; (in /etc/environment). Problem: for this to work, the server and every
&gt; single Jack application (including the pulse-jack bridge) must be running
&gt; with a 0000 umask, which sounds a bit scary to me.
&gt;

should not be the case. should be fixed if it is the case.


&gt; So I've hacked a little enhancement to the promiscuous mode which makes it
&gt; possible to pass the name or gid of a group through the
&gt; JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER variable. In that case, the sockets, shared memory
&gt; segments and semaphores have their permissions tightened so only members of
&gt; that group will get access to them. More importantly, it is not needed
&gt; anymore to fiddle with the umask, even if no group is given.
&gt;

sounds like an improvement.


&gt; With that in place, and after having changed the default PulseAudio
&gt; configuration (/etc/pulse/default.pa) to statically load the pulse-jack
&gt; bridge, each user session has its shiny desktop sounds working, and every
&gt; user is able to run Jack applications whenever they want.
&gt;

multi-user JACK is not something i'm particularly interested in but perhaps
other people will feel differently.

i'm also fairly sure that the ALSA loopback device is a better method for
Pulse&lt;=&gt;JACK interaction than the pulse JACK sink/sources.
