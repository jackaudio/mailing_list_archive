&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Nowadays it's quite easy to make PulseAudio and Jack work together, mostly
&gt; thanks to the dbus api, but as soon as a second user enters the scene, by
&gt; means of the user switcher applet, it's once again an inferior user
&gt; experience as compared to what a PulseAudio-only system gives. Generally
&gt; the second user will get no sound at all, other problems arise when the
&gt; second user wants to make use of some Jack applications...
&gt;
&gt; So I've been working lately on making it easier to use Jack as the default
&gt; sound system on a shared workstation, with PulseAudio as a helper for
&gt; desktop sounds. I've investigated 3 solutions which I'll present here.
&gt;
&gt; In all cases it was necessary to have a system-wide Jack server launched
&gt; at boot time. First problem: there is no session dbus available at boot
&gt; time. There are basically 3 ways of solving this:
&gt; 1. use the system dbus instead by faking the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS.
&gt; This will require some modification of system policies to allow the owning
&gt; of the org.freedesktop.ReserveDevice1.Audio0 name
&gt; 2. launch a session bus, which will be used only for this purpose
&gt; 3. hack Jack to allow bypassing the whole thing
&gt; I've chosen 3, the formers do no really reserve anything anyway as the
&gt; buses are not connected to each other. By passing the
&gt; JACK_NO_AUDIO_RESERVATION environment variable I can now disable the
&gt; audio_acquire/audio_release callbacks.
&gt;
&gt; The first solution that comes to mind is to make this system-wide server
&gt; run in promiscuous mode, so I've exported JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER globally
&gt; (in /etc/environment). Problem: for this to work, the server and every
&gt; single Jack application (including the pulse-jack bridge) must be running
&gt; with a 0000 umask, which sounds a bit scary to me. So I've hacked a little
&gt; enhancement to the promiscuous mode which makes it possible to pass the
&gt; name or gid of a group through the JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER variable. In
&gt; that case, the sockets, shared memory segments and semaphores have their
&gt; permissions tightened so only members of that group will get access to
&gt; them. More importantly, it is not needed anymore to fiddle with the umask,
&gt; even if no group is given.
&gt; With that in place, and after having changed the default PulseAudio
&gt; configuration (/etc/pulse/default.pa) to statically load the pulse-jack
&gt; bridge, each user session has its shiny desktop sounds working, and every
&gt; user is able to run Jack applications whenever they want.
&gt;
&gt; One (big) con is that as everybody share the same Jack server the graph
&gt; may easily become incomprehensible (jack_keyboard, jack_keyboard-01,
&gt; jack_keyboard-02, all belonging to different users...). Also, if a user
&gt; start the Jack transport, it will be started for all users !
&gt;
&gt; That's where the two other solutions comes into play (they really are to
&gt; variants of the same solution).
&gt; The idea is to have a main system-wide Jack server in charge of the
&gt; hardware driver, and a second per-user Jack server launched through dbus
&gt; api, connected by some way to the former, and handling the connections with
&gt; the various Jack applications of that user session.
&gt;
&gt; This can easily be implemented by using NetJack bound to the loopback
&gt; interface.
&gt; In this solution, the promiscuous mode is not necessary anymore. The
&gt; netmanager have to be loaded in the main server at boot time, bound to the
&gt; 127.0.0.1 address, with the auto-connect feature enabled. The default.pa
&gt; should use jackdbus-detect and a .config/jack/conf.xml must be put in each
&gt; user's HOME so the net driver is loaded when a Jack server is spawned by
&gt; the user.
&gt;
&gt; Now, each user will only see his/her own applications in the graph, but
&gt; the Jack transport is still unique across the NetJack network. Another
&gt; problem is the overhead introduced by NetJack.
&gt;
&gt; To address these, I've hacked a new JackProxyDriver which is similar to
&gt; the JackNetDriver, but only uses plain Jack API to talk to its upstream
&gt; server so the overhead is reduced to its minimum.
&gt; In this solution, the promiscuous mode is again necessary, but only for
&gt; the main server. The per-user server will run in normal mode toward its
&gt; clients, and will use a promiscuous connection to talk to the main server.
&gt; The .config/jack/conf.xml must be changed to load the proxy driver.
&gt;
&gt; Now that I'm happy with the state of my shared desktop I've sent two pull
&gt; request for all the bits described above.
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/pull/77 contains the reservation
&gt; bypass and the promiscuous mode enhancement,
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/pull/78 contains the JackProxyDriver.
&gt;
&gt; If someone is interested to try it out, I've setup a PPA (currently only
&gt; for 14.04) with a jackd2 package based on KXStudio's one.
&gt;
&gt; Comments and suggestions are welcome.
&gt;

&gt;
