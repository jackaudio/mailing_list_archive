Yes it is. Without touching the umask, both the server side sockets (for
requests) and the client side sockets (for notifications) are created with
the default umask which usually is 0022 so they will not be writable by the
other side if its not the same user. Same is true for semaphores and shm
segments. Only the shm registry had its permissions explicitly set to 0666.

You're probably right about ALSA loopback. I'll try it out. But this
doesn't change the picture a lot. All the multi-user Jack related issues
would still be present.

Thanks.
