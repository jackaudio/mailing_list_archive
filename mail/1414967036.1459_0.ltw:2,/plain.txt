Hi Feiko

[The original message in jack-devel was posted with subject "wrong FFADO
version 2.2.9999-2573"]

This means that the FFADO API provided by the version of libffado being used
by jackd does not match what jackd expects.  There are a number of possible
reasons for this.  Even so, this issue should have been taken care of
automatically by FFADO's build system.  Perhaps there's a corner case on
your system which is producing the wrong answer.

Could you please post:

 - the name and version of the distribution you are using

 - a brief description of the steps you went through to install jackd and/or
   FFADO if these were not supplied by your distribution.  In particular I
   notice that the FFADO version is a snapshot of our development trunk so
   presumedly you compiled FFADO yourself.

 - the output produced by "ffado-diag", so we can see exactly what is in
   your system.

Please follow up to ffado-devel: this is almost certainly a FFADO build
issue and has nothing directly to do with JACK.

The ffado-mixer is independent of JACK.  In other words, Jackd does not need
to be running in order to use the mixer.
