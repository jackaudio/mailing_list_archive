Subject:     [Jack-Devel] USB MIDI keyboard Akai LPK, jackd

I got Akai LPK25 and I am trying to make it working on my Ubuntu. I tried
to follow a tutorial
http://terokarvinen.com/2014/usb-midi-keyboard-on-linux-akai-lpk25-professional.
I have no knowledge about jack and other applications involed so let me
write everything since I don't know where to look for the problem. I posted
the problem here
http://askubuntu.com/questions/544672/usb-midi-keyboard-akai-lpk-jackd and
they suggested to aks you here.

When I run

    zynjacku &

I get errors

    Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory
    Cannot connect to server request channel
    jack server is not running or cannot be started
    Failed to connect to JACK.
    Failed to initialize zynjacku engine

I figured I may need to run the jackd server first so I installed it and ran

    jackd -sRp 70 -d alsa -d hw:1 -r 44100 -H -z s

but I still can't make zynjacku running and get

    flex scanner jammed

If I run zynaddsubfx and aconnectgui I manage to get signal from the
keyboard (the indicator at the bottom gets blue) but I can't hear anythnig.

I tried to manually send some signal to jackd by `ecasound` and it reaches
the jackd server but again I can't hear any sound.

I have totally no experience with jackd so that's why my trials are that
random. Thanks in advance for your help.

If I run `jackd -sRp 70 -d alsa -d hw:1 -r 44100 -H -z s`, I get

    no message buffer overruns
    JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10
    audio_reservation_init
    Acquire audio card Audio0
    creating alsa driver ...
hw:0|hw:0|1024|2|44100|0|0|hwmon|swmeter|-|32bit
    Failed to open server

Thank you very much in advance,

Best,
Łukasz Kidziński
