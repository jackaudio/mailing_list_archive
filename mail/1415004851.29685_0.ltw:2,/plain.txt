Hello Łukasz,

zynjacky is hopelessly outdated and you don't need it to set up your
LPK25. Also you don't aconnectgui.

This is what I would do to get things going:
- Connect your LPK25
- Install necessary software: apt-get install jackd qjackctl zynaddsubfx
- Start QjackCtl and set it up for your soundcard, some googling should
get you started
- Start ZynAddSubFX and make the connections in the Audio tab from the
Zyn output ports to your playback ports.
- Do the same for MIDI, connect your LPK25 output to the Zyn input in
the ALSA tab of the QjackCTL Connections window.

That should do the trick, if not, shoot!

jackd -s is not necessary in most cases. -R (real-time mode) is a
default option so not necessary. -p 70 sets JACK to use 70 ports, you
probably mean -P 70, to set JACK's priority to 70. Afaik -H is only used
if your soundcard supports hardware monitoring. What soundcard are you
using? You also don't need to set dithering (-z s), the default setting
should be just fine.

Try raising the verbosity of JACK by adding -v:

jackd -v -P 70 -d alsa -d hw:1 -r 44100
