Hi Jonathan,

Tnx for your reply.

I did a stupid thing I've installed Ubuntu 12.04.5LTS instead off studio 
so today I clean installed Ubuntu studio12.04.5.
And yes again problems with my audio card FFADO those not see him again 
so I think I've to build it for SVN? Or?????

For your info I had Ubutustudio14.04 running good with my card (after 
tweaking my system with the help of you guys) but I need a new program 
(Airtime) and it was not running under 14.04.
so I've to go to 12.04 that's why I make the switch. But I was under the 
understanding that the problem with my sound card was no more in the new 
version(.5) of Ubuntu (SVN2500 +).

Met vriendelijke groet,

Feiko van de Velde

&gt; Hi Feiko

&gt; [The original message in jack-devel was posted with subject "wrong FFADO
&gt; version 2.2.9999-2573"]

&gt;&gt; I got something strange the jack server wont start and say wrong FFADO
&gt;&gt; version 2.2.9999-2573.
&gt;&gt; the version from jackd is 1.9.8
&gt; This means that the FFADO API provided by the version of libffado being used
&gt; by jackd does not match what jackd expects.  There are a number of possible
&gt; reasons for this.  Even so, this issue should have been taken care of
&gt; automatically by FFADO's build system.  Perhaps there's a corner case on
&gt; your system which is producing the wrong answer.
&gt;
&gt; Could you please post:
&gt;
&gt;   - the name and version of the distribution you are using
&gt;
&gt;   - a brief description of the steps you went through to install jackd and/or
&gt;     FFADO if these were not supplied by your distribution.  In particular I
&gt;     notice that the FFADO version is a snapshot of our development trunk so
&gt;     presumedly you compiled FFADO yourself.
&gt;
&gt;   - the output produced by "ffado-diag", so we can see exactly what is in
&gt;     your system.
&gt;
&gt; Please follow up to ffado-devel: this is almost certainly a FFADO build
&gt; issue and has nothing directly to do with JACK.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; my focusrite pro24 seems to work in the FFADO mixer but my FW led is not
&gt;&gt; lit up on the front of the focusrite unit.
&gt; The ffado-mixer is independent of JACK.  In other words, Jackd does not need
&gt; to be running in order to use the mixer.
&gt;
