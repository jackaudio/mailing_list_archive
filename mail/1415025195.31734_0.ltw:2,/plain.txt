Hi Jonathan,

Tnx for your reply.

I did a stupid thing I've installed Ubuntu 12.04.5LTS instead off studio 
so today I clean installed Ubuntu studio12.04.5.
And yes again problems with my audio card FFADO those not see him again 
so I think I've to build it for SVN? Or?????

For your info I had Ubutustudio14.04 running good with my card (after 
tweaking my system with the help of you guys) but I need a new program 
(Airtime) and it was not running under 14.04.
so I've to go to 12.04 that's why I make the switch. But I was under the 
understanding that the problem with my sound card was no more in the new 
version(.5) of Ubuntu (SVN2500 +).

Met vriendelijke groet,

Feiko van de Velde
