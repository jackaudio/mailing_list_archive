&gt; I did a stupid thing I've installed Ubuntu 12.04.5LTS instead off studio

Studio is definitely a better starting point.

&gt; And yes again problems with my audio card FFADO those not see him again so
&gt; I think I've to build it for SVN?  Or?????

12.04 is now very old, as is the version of FFADO installed on it.  If it
doesn't work as expected then we will need a newer version of FFADO
installed on the system in order to assist further.  Since we are a small
team working in our spare time it is not feasible for us to dedicate
significant amounts of time to debug 2-3 year old versions of FFADO,
especially since newer versions fix many problems that the older versions
had.

&gt; For your info I had Ubutustudio14.04 running good with my card (after
&gt; tweaking my system with the help of you guys) but I need a new program
&gt; (Airtime) and it was not running under 14.04.  so I've to go to 12.04
&gt; that's why I make the switch.

It is disappointing and puzzling as to why Airtime isn't keeping up with
modern versions of distributions.  A quick search seems to indicate that
12.04 is the most recent supported distribution.  While the source code is
available, my guess is that it depends on additional libraries which don't
ship with Ubuntu for one reason or another.  While it may be possible to
manually compile all of these it will be time consuming.  There is also a
real possibility that such libraries may require adjustments in order to
build with the more recent versions of the compilers.  In summary, going
this route could end up being a time consuming process.  If you are able to
get FFADO 2.2.0 or later compiled and installed successfully under 12.04
this would clearly be the easiest approach.

&gt; But I was under the understanding that the problem with my sound card was
&gt; no more in the new version(.5) of Ubuntu (SVN2500 +).

Given that it worked under 14.04 it seems very likely that the problems
encountered have been addressed in the time since 12.04 and 14.04.
