Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Does Jack Server work in win8.1 x64?

So I have Code::Blocks 10.05 installed, and I installed the SJLJ version of
i686-w64-mingw32, tre is installed and copied into the windows folder.

I open up the libjack.cbp file and try to build and I get:

	libjack - Win32 Debug 64bits" uses an invalid compiler. Probably the
toolchain path within the compiler options is not setup correctly?!
Skipping...

So where am I going wrong?

They are CodeBlock projects in the "windows" folder to build JACK. Still a
bit complex probably, you are on your own here...

Hoontech DSP2000/DC-DAC2000 cards (ICE1712 Chipset) merged with a custom
.asoundrc, on Ubuntu Studio 12.04 with Kernel 3.14.04. After running Ardour
/ JackD for a couple of minutes JackD throws a large amount of the following
errors  (until it shuts down by itself, usually somewhere between one hour
or so). The audio functionality itself is ok.

difference, even not increasing/decrease periods/buffer size on JackD, or
sync one card to the other one via SP/DIF (which i usually do). I had this
issue on different hardware platforms (on an "old" Phenom 9850 Quad-Core and
actually on a Intel Q6600 Quad-Core running at Standard frequency, not
overclocked). Playing around with the CPU governor has also no effect.
