Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] cross compiling jack2 library for ARMv6

Just wondering if this was a stupid question to ask.

How to compile libjack as a library for ARMv6 platform in order to able
to cross compile a Jack based application on x64 Linux platform (Ubuntu)
so that it runs on a Raspberry PI (with Arch Linux)

Thanks,
