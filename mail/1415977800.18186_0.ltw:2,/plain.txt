Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] cross compiling jack2 library for ARMv6

 

Not sure if i would be able to help but gentoo has a cross dev
environment where i could compile something quickly for an arm system.
not sure if it would work with what you are saying.

I have successfully cross compiled the alsa-lib for the Raspberry PI (with arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc) on this system and and compiled a program which runs fine on the RPI using ALSA with the provided tools (https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git [1]). Now I wish to do the same and compile an application using Jack against the Jack library (and thereafter run this on the PI with JACK2 installed). Any guidance how to cross-compile a jack2 library for ARMv6 on the x64 system so that I can link the application to the resulting Jack ARMv6 library?
