Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Proper JACK Build tools?

Hello, I have one week to get Jack running properly on Win 8.1 and fix those client-close freezes that are still irritating.  I have more than a decade of experience designing audio engines for the likes of Sonic Foundry in their professional audio editing tools, so technically, I am up to the task.  But where I am withering is setting up the tool chain to actually dig into the task

I’ve got a branch set up from JACK via git, and the docs in in suggest Code::Blocks 10.05 and MinGW/SJLJ – is that still a requirement?  I have both installed, but I must be missing some configuration magic, because when I try to build JackLib I get an error message suggesting the compiler is not configured properly.

 

This morning I am working on trying to Install the MinGW version of Code::Blocks 10.05 and see if I can at least get a build going with that, even it the SJLJ thing fails that will get me moving.  But I could sure use some advice from someone who has built JACK recently for Windows – otherwise I am going to have to flail around the continuum of tool possibilities until I stumble on the right combination.
