I did use http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net tool chain in Code::Blocks  when I installed (years ago…) a VirtualBox to compile JACK on Windows.

> Hello, I have one week to get Jack running properly on Win 8.1 and fix those client-close freezes that are still irritating.  I have more than a decade of experience designing audio engines for the likes of Sonic Foundry in their professional audio editing tools, so technically, I am up to the task.  But where I am withering is setting up the tool chain to actually dig into the task

I have both installed, but I must be missing some configuration magic, because when I try to build JackLib I get an error message suggesting the compiler is not configured properly.

But I could sure use some advice from someone who has built JACK recently for Windows – otherwise I am going to have to flail around the continuum of tool possibilities until I stumble on the right combination.
