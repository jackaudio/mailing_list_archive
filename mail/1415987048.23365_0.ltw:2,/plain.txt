Hi Matthew,

I'm the main Windows developer for a product called Mixbus (which also 
uses Jack).  I'm not sure if this'll help you - but when I moved my 
development environment to Win8.1, initially I also saw Jack crashes 
when Mixbus was shutting down.

It turned out that somehow or other, the Jack headers I was compiling 
against didn't match my version of libjack.  I can't remember now 
whether the headers were newer or whether libjack was newer but they 
were from different versions - that's the point. Since I solved that 
problem the crashing problems have disappeared.

Something for you to consider.?
