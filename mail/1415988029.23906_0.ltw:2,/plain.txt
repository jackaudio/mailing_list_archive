Thanks for the link.  I will give it a try.  So is there anything I have to
set up more than the exe compiler commands in Code::Blocks to make this
work?

I did use http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net tool chain in Code::Blocks  when I
installed (years ago…) a VirtualBox to compile JACK on Windows.

task.  But where I am withering is setting up the tool chain to actually dig

Code::Blocks 10.05 and MinGW/SJLJ – is that still a requirement?  I have
both installed, but I must be missing some configuration magic, because when
I try to build JackLib I get an error message suggesting the compiler is not
configured properly.

some advice from someone who has built JACK recently for Windows – otherwise
I am going to have to flail around the continuum of tool possibilities until
I stumble on the right combination.
