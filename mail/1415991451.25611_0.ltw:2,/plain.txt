So I installed codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup-TDM-GCC-481.exe from
http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26

It detected the GCC compiler on startup. But after I loaded the workspace
for jack I got:

"Current target 'Win32 Release 64bits' doesn't have valid compiler!"

I tried setting all the commands for the compiler toolchain (which seemed to
be correct at first) manually, and no luck.  I have to be missing something
- what could it be?
