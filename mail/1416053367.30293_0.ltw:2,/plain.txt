How about basic connectivity: Are all the machines on the same subnet? 
Can your windows machine ping the linux master? Can you RDP into your 
windows machine from the linux master (which is how I control my windows 
slave).

Try removing all arguments and explicitly give the IP address (netjack2)

   jackd.exe -dnet -a [ master ip address ]
