Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] connecting jack between a linux audio master and a windows slave

hi all,
ping is possible, both ways
firewall is off on both ends
rdesktop from master to client , possible
the serverfault solution does not work for me :( - i had actually come
across this one . running the cmd:
netsh 192.168.112.143 ip show joins
does not work stating
"The following command was not found: ip show joins"

in the comment of the answer they state that I can see the multicast
addresses from "route print", but i am not sure where that is:
http://pastebin.com/3JxeZTax
could you point me somewhere?
Perhaps the multicast that windows forwards are in the subnet
224.0.0.0/240.0.0.0 and jack broadcasts in 225.0.0.0 ?


I also tried it without adding the <interface ip> part but this did not
change the outcome.

finally, removing all arguments did not work either.
jackd.exe -dnet - a 192.168.112.138
the same "waiting for a master" msg appears.
