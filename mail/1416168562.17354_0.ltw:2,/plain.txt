Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] connecting jack between a linux audio master and a windows slave

I'm not so familiar with netjack, but perhaps if you can clarify some
things someone else will notice something.

First, pastebin is not convenient, maybe some people have not seen your
verbose output
because you made it more difficult.  80 lines of text is not unreasonable
for an email, just paste it in.  I have copied your pastebin verbose
output to this message for convenience.

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack>jackd.exe -v -dnet  -i2 -o9 -C8 -p8

Can you explain what you intended each command line argument to mean?  I
have looked at the man page on my Fedora 20 system and I do not see a
section for net, just netone, which is a slightly different protocol.

For netone, -i2 would mean 2 capture channels, -o9 would be 9 playback
channels, there is no -C argument shown, and -p means frames per period. 
I don't think 8 frames per period would make sense, and also given the
verbose output it seems like it may have been interpreted as IP port
number:
 Jack: JackNetDriver::JackNetDriver ip 225.3.19.154, port 8

You used the exact same command line arguments on the linux slave machines
which worked correctly?
Maybe if you capture the verbose output from a working linux slave some
difference might become obvious.  The port number 8 being associated with
the address 225.3.19.154 stands out as looking suspicious to me after all
the previous talk of port 19000, I don't think using a privileged port
number is really what you intended.
