Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Proper JACK Build tools?

QUESTION: Is there a good process for using the resulting binaries on a
machine that already has jack installed?

I have arrived at a build with the following recipe:

* Latest Code::Blocks (13.12)
* Win32/64 version of MinGW::TDM
* Manually tweaking the build options for each sub-project to get
Code::Blocks to recognize the compiler tools.
* Updating tre's config.h to elimate the snprintf define (this is already
covered in the docs)

From the github main site, you can always work on your git branch and do a
"merge request".
