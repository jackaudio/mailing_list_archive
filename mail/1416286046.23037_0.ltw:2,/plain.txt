(Whoa you're fast. Seconds after I posted, the reply is there and the
 question is still not, after several minutes!)

I could try eliminating that intermediate thread and create a messaging 
 ring buffer directly from the notification thread to our RT process callback. 
The very next process callback will grab the messages, so it's safe
 and as fast as necessary.
That way it'll work transparently with both Jack1 and Jack2, and it
 won't have to block or wait.

Still, would like to know if that is true or even a valid statement.
Thanks.
