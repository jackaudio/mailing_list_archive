Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] same jack version, but different protocol versions (revisited)

hi all,
linux is ubuntustudio 14.04 64bit and I -wrongly- trusted the version
reported by jackd to be 1.9.10 .
now that I checked the installed package version (dpkg -l), i see that I
have :
ii  jackd2            1.9.9.5+20130 amd64         JACK Audio Connection Kit

so this indeed is different to 1.9.10 .

Having said that , I have downloaded and compiled from sources
1) the tarball for jack-1.9.10 (as grabbed from the website)
2) the git version directly from the jackd2 guthub site.

I did check macro NETWORK_VERSION and it is set to 8 this time around.
Still running the new jack prints the same error , which means the "net"
backend used is still the old one. "ldd" on jackd , and netmanager.so point
to libjackserver.so and the latter does not use "jack_net.so". I guess
copying the newer "jack_net.so" over the older one is not a good idea, so
i'll have to ask: can I find windows installer for jack_v1.9.9.5 anywhere?

thank you
