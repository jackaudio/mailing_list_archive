Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] same jack version, but different protocol versions (revisited)

Agreed, which is why I did not install the compiled jack in the first place.
One solution is to install the jackd2 package from a later ubuntu studio
version - I am working on that in parallel.
The other solution is to install jack 1.9.9.5 on my windows pc's, which
frankly is easier. So is there a version of jack2 v1.9.9.5 (64bit) laying
in some public server? (or does any one have it stored in their hard disks
?:) I happen to have installers for v1.9.9.4 and 1.9.8 but not the 1.9.9.5)

Thank you
