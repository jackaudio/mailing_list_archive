well learning how to treat debian packages is not my scope right now.
i'd have to find all dependencies to compile jackd with dbus support , and
do that  across all the linux jack clients, too.
It is still easier to compile jack for windows (even though I have not
found a guide yet). I am hoping for an executable though :)
