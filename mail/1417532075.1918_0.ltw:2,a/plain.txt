Could as well work:

 # apt-get install git-buildpackage devscripts pristine-tar
 # apt-get build-dep jackd2

 $ git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/pkg-multimedia/jackd2.git
 $ git checkout upstream
 $ git checkout pristine-tar
 $ git checkout master
 $ git-buildpackage -uc -us


This should give you a new set of jackd2 packages based on my latest
Debian package in ../. You'd then run dpkg -i --force-all ../*.deb

The --force-all will stop dpkg from complaining about missing
dependencies.


If it works, could somebody please write a wiki page on our github page?
I don't want to retype it every time some Ubuntu user needs to update
his outdated distro. ;)


Cheers
