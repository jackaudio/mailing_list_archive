I'm not sure why though, both jacks report 'protocol 8' when doing
'jackd -V'

Trying the other way around, doing 'jackd -d net' on OSX to a jack
server on linux gives the same result, only protocol numbers are
swapped:

   Error : slave walter-2.local is running with a different protocol 8 != 6
   Can't init new NetMaster...

Any clues?
