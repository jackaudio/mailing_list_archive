Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] same jack version, but different protocol versions (revisited)

Adrian,
I got round to following your instruction,
They worked like a charm.

I would offer to write the wiki, but have little knowledge of the debian
packaging management workflow.
I also have little time to invest in learning this right now.
Should anyone choose to append this information in the wiki, it would be
extremely helpful to have detailed information about what each step does,
for those of us that come from slackware, or otherwise non debian
environment:)

thanks again!
