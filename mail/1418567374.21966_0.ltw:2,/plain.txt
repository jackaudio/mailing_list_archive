Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [JACK2] commented out code

While reading through parts of the source, I have encountered some parts
of code, that are just dead in the sense, that they are commented out, like:

https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/9e70b86c6536d0177234834f2764eff5517600cc/linux/alsa/alsa_driver.c#L512

https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/9e70b86c6536d0177234834f2764eff5517600cc/linux/alsa/alsa_driver.c#L564

https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/9e70b86c6536d0177234834f2764eff5517600cc/linux/alsa/alsa_driver.c#L889

I'm not familiar enough with the codebase to tell if these server any
purpose anymore. Is there a good reason why they were not deleted yet?

If cleanup patches are welcome, I would look into removing what I can
find on my way through the repository.
