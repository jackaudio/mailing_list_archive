Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Using Jack2 (jackdmp) on Mac OS X: Version 0.9 or 1.9.10?

I want to use Jack2 on OSX.

But I have a problem. I can find compiled binaries for version 0.9, or the source tarball says that it is 1.9.10. Those versions do not match. According to the readme at https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2, I'm supposed to get the ready to use binary from http://www.jackosx.com/, but it also only has binary version 0.9.

So, help please? What do I want?
