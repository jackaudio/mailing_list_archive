Yikes!
No I certainly would not recommend doing that!

This sounds like exactly the problem we have been speaking of 
 which is solved by checking/fixing the library/executable paths, 
 just as the ./configure message warns of.

After fixing the library paths you MUST run 'ldconfig' as root.
I did not mention it, but it usually goes without saying.

You may want to change path settings in apps, for example in
 QJackCtl you might want to change the path to jackd.


I have both Jack-1 and Jack-2 installed and they both run fine,
 even with pulse audio.
To switch between Jack-1 and Jack-2 I simply uninstall or reinstall 
 Jack-1 and rerun 'ldconfig' as root.
Instead, I could leave them both, re-edit ld.so.conf and rerun 'ldconfig'
 but that is simply the easier way for me.


Check/perform these general steps with any software built locally, 
 especially if overriding a packaged version. 
Packages are not always easy to remove. 
Most locally built software should work fine without removing 
 or disrupting packages.
