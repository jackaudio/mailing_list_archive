I have the exact same issue, expect I'm only linking to libjack64.lib (not
the server) and am using 1.9.10.

I get a read access violation from something to do with
jack_ringbuffer_get_write_vector. Given it's before anything is called I'm
guessing it's during the dll load / symbol resolution?

Sorry I'm not being more helpful - I'm using the libraries from the
installer package so don't have debug symbols & my understanding of the
disassembler output is fairly non-existent.

This is an x64 project compiled with the VS 2013 compiler.
If I compile as 32 bit everything works, it's also fine in 64 bit on Windows
7.
