Sure, and that will certainly continue in future that some MIDI keyboards are 
sold using MIDI Running Status (even though the ratio is declining since USB 
MIDI). But that's not the point. The design decision of JACK is simply that 
JACK client developers can safely assume that they don't have to handle 
Running Status and instead the respective MIDI input driver of JACK must take 
care of that, that is if the OS's MIDI subsystem does not handle it already. 
For example the ALSA MIDI driver handles RS and the CoreMIDI driver of JACK2 
handles it (the CoreMIDI driver though was just equipped with that because a 
user reported that he encountered RS with CoreMIDI, which turned out to be 
false later on).

So if you encounter MIDI RS with JACK, then this is a bug and the respective 
MIDI input driver in JACK must be fixed.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Actually the JACK MIDI spec states that running-status is not allowed,
&gt; &gt; and all MIDI notes should be normalized:
&gt; &gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/headers/blob/master/midiport.h#L62
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It makes it a lot easier for applications to implement MIDI : and
&gt; &gt; places the running status-byte check burden on JACK MIDI
&gt; &gt; implementations instead of in every JACK MIDI client. Thanks JACK devs
