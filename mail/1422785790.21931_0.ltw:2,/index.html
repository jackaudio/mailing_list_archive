Just for completeness. MIDI version 1 runs at 1.5 and 12Mb/sec
Mostly only mice and keyboards run at 1.5Mb/s. Most other hardware
(not the Access Virus) mostly use USB 2.0 (480Mb/sec)
because they also may send audio. Funny enough, the Roland TR-8 applies
running status on the MIDI 5-pin connection but does NOT apply running
status on the MIDI/Audio USB connection. Probably all modern devices 
do this in the same way. Thanks a lot for pointing out the jack
implementation. I coded an ALSA client and had to deal with status bytes
and after that coded the Jack client to record MIDI. Jack inserting the
status slipped my attention.

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, exactly.
&gt; I'll add the following re Hardware MIDI / software MIDI, just for
&gt; completeness and future reference.

&gt; &gt; For whatever it is worth, many older devices any even modern devices

&gt; Yes indeed: and it makes sense for *hardware* MIDI units to do so. The
&gt; MIDI cable[1] runs at a baud rate of 31250, which limits the amount of
&gt; messages that can be sent over the cable in a certain time-period.
&gt; Using running-status increases the amount of events that can be sent.
&gt; 
&gt; On the software side, having running status is a bad idea: the 4 bytes
&gt; duplicated to have a status per message is well worth spending, if
&gt; consideration is given to ease of implementation of MIDI code.
&gt; 
&gt; So in a best-of-both-worlds, hardware uses running status (as the
&gt; hardware you mention does), and software always includes the status
&gt; byte, so implementations check the first byte of the message and
&gt; easily deal with it.
&gt; 
&gt; As Christian noted, this is exactly what JACK does - MIDI input
&gt; drivers add the running status byte to messages that did not include a
&gt; status byte, and provides the JACK MIDI graph (and hence all JACK
&gt; clients) with normalized "status byte included" MIDI messages.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, -Harry
&gt; 
&gt; [1] Note that an actual 5 pin DIN MIDI cable is meant: USB MIDI
&gt; generally runs at 115200 baud, allowing many more events per unit
&gt; time.
