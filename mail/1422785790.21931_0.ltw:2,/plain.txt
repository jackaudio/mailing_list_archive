Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Dispersing MIDI messages: one to multiple

Just for completeness. MIDI version 1 runs at 1.5 and 12Mb/sec
Mostly only mice and keyboards run at 1.5Mb/s. Most other hardware
(not the Access Virus) mostly use USB 2.0 (480Mb/sec)
because they also may send audio. Funny enough, the Roland TR-8 applies
running status on the MIDI 5-pin connection but does NOT apply running
status on the MIDI/Audio USB connection. Probably all modern devices 
do this in the same way. Thanks a lot for pointing out the jack
implementation. I coded an ALSA client and had to deal with status bytes
and after that coded the Jack client to record MIDI. Jack inserting the
status slipped my attention.
