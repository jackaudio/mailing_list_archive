There is a bit of confusion here, I think.

JACK does not allow the use of running status BETWEEN ports (i.e. a JACK
MIDI client cannot send, and will never receive, messages that use running
status.

However, when MIDI data arrives from the outside it gets into JACK through
"bridges" which handle running status just fine (and convert the message
stream into the equivalent set, but without running status).
