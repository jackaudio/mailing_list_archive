Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jackd: unknown driver 'alsa'

You or someone else built JACK on a system without the ALSA (libasound)
development package installed. This is NOT an error  - JACK can run happily
without the ALSA backend - but it doesn't correspond to what most people
typically want to do with it.
