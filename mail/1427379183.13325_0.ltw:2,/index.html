Hi Matt,

as far as I can see it at the moment, the situation is like this:

iOS: Technically not a problem at all, however due to the nature of iOS and 
its prohibition of DLLs, you will have licensing issues. The authors of 
netjack would need to change the license so that someone could use it there as 
part of a static lib linked into an app distributed on the App Store.

Android: the main issue I still see on Android is that the kernel shipped with 
all Android devices is not real-time safe/low latency capable. Which makes it 
IMO useless for audio applications. Maybe Kim could comment whether there any 
kinds of plans to address this on Android in near future.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I think it would be handy to have a transparent netjack audio device for
&gt; IOS and Android.
&gt; The idea is that it would enable regular apps to stream audio to netjack
&gt; servers rather then the Andoroid or IOS hardware.
&gt; What do you think ?
&gt; 
&gt; I have done some exploring for Android and also (just) asked Kim Jeong
&gt; Yeon (the porter of Jack to Android) whether he knew anything - waiting
&gt; for a response.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is what I have found for Android :
&gt; There is a MediaRouter class ...
&gt; http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.robolectric/android-all
&gt; /5.0.0_r2-robolectric-0/android/media/MediaRouter.java?av=h
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;       This flag ROUTE_TYPE_LIVE_AUDIO is relevant for searching the code.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure how to use it or how to interface to it ?
&gt; It is possible we can do it directly from JAVA or the C++ NDK.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know or even know anyone who knows ?
&gt; 
&gt; Similar for IOS ... anyone know or know anyone who knows ?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
&gt; Matt
