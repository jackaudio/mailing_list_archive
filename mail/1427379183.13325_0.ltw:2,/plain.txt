Hi Matt,

as far as I can see it at the moment, the situation is like this:

iOS: Technically not a problem at all, however due to the nature of iOS and 
its prohibition of DLLs, you will have licensing issues. The authors of 
netjack would need to change the license so that someone could use it there as 
part of a static lib linked into an app distributed on the App Store.

Android: the main issue I still see on Android is that the kernel shipped with 
all Android devices is not real-time safe/low latency capable. Which makes it 
IMO useless for audio applications. Maybe Kim could comment whether there any 
kinds of plans to address this on Android in near future.

CU
Christian
