Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] netjack audio routing from smart OSs (IOS and Android)

Hi,

I think we have to distinguish between Jack (as audio router) and 
Netjack (as protocol):
* Porting the Jack server to iOS has been done, but due to iOS changes 
it cannot be used any more.
* But iOS instead now has an API for "Inter-App Audio".
Using the (quite simple) netjack1 protocol "standalone" (e.g. by 
reimplementing it - no licensing problems here) and providing it as 
"Netjack audio source" could work.

I'm not sure about possible clock issues; I think using the iOS device 
as "netjack master" should work.
When the netjack protocol handling is statically embedded to be used 
only in a certain application, this is probably even less of a problem.

Using the device as "netjack slave" (i.e. "jackd -d net") forces the 
masters clock onto the device while e.g. the audio hardware of the iPad 
has it's own idea of timing.

* Wrt. to Android, I don't know much about this MediaRouter class....
Still, implementing the netjack protocol inside a single application is 
possible (and you already mentioned Jack for Android).

The latency stuff becomes really noticeable when you send AND receive 
channels at the same time; lets say you on the netjack slave you just 
connect an input to an output. Then you will have probably a noticeable 
and non-deterministic delay between these stream back on your device 
(the master).

In contrast, Jack for Android aims to guarantee a certain latency -- 
which, in turn, requires low-latency scheduling from the kernel.
