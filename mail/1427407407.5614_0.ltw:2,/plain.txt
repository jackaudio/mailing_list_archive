Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] netjack audio routing from smart OSs (IOS and Android)

OK,

I hear what you are all saying.
Let us simplify and refocus the concept in a manner that makes it easier.

Lets assume all netjack servers are on other devices. We want to fling 
audio from the smartOS with our players and streamers (in our hand - or 
otherwise) to various computers around the place.

I understand there are two issues, technical and licensing. For now lets 
put licensing aside whilst we address the technical and at a later stage 
work out what is legal once we have the concept. Legally we may never be 
able to release the binaries, however source code in uncompiled form in 
a repository shouldn't be a problem.

W.R.T. latency. Consider for now that large latency is OK, once it is 
implemented we can find out our limitations. If worst comes to worst, 
then it may only suit playback, that in itself is still useful.

On the smart device, if netjack is the sync. and the source, it is 
probable that the audio will be produced and consumed as required by the 
OS subsystem which is funneling (IAA on apple and the Media classes on 
Android) to this device. In other words, it is likely that we don't need 
to worry about clock sources and things like that, they are already 
taken care for us, there may be problems in connecting to multiple 
netjack servers, however this again is something which can be debugged 
during implementation. In all likelyhood some clients will xrun for the 
slowest servers (when they are all connected at the same time), however 
the rate of xruns should be low and can be reduced further by using the 
same hardware for the jack servers.

It appears that it may be difficult to get this running on IOS, 
particularly if it requires a large rewrite to get it working with 
CFMessagePort.
Perhaps for now we can focus on Android. We can further simplify things 
by looking for netjack integration alone this should reduce dependency 
issues and may make the whole thing more vanilla.

The question still remains ... is there example code out there for 
interfacing at this low level to the Android audio media routing subsystem ?
