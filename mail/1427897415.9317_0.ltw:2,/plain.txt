Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Development

Can you just write device drivers for all behringer products like the xenyx
x1222
make it so I have access to each mono and Left/Right send on each stereo out

 I wish to have drums recording directly in ardour, and send a guitar
through guitarix and rakarrack and record both at the same time in ardour.
also write tutorials on writing device drivers.

also, consider writing an audio kit under blender it might be interesting
with good graphics, do again, write detailed install notes.

Also, write a few tutorials on how to write plugins for a drum sequencer
and drum synth like a soviet March UDS

ALso, write an access virus B tutorial and a memorymoog tutorial

and write some serious compressors and a mixer software

tutorials are important, as are device drivers. audio and im trying to get
pygame to be used as one game engine, they would be intersting projects and
useful
