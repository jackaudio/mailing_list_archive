&gt; Can you just write device drivers for all behringer products like the

You're a bit confused. JACK isn't involved at the device driver level. JACK
relies on the OS providing drivers for audio interfaces. It just uses them.


&gt;  I wish to have drums recording directly in ardour, and send a guitar
&gt; through guitarix and rakarrack and record both at the same time in ardour.
&gt; also write tutorials on writing device drivers.
&gt;

Writing device drivers has nothing to do with JACK. There is already a very
good book on writing Linux device drivers.


&gt;
&gt; also, consider writing an audio kit under blender it might be interesting
&gt; with good graphics, do again, write detailed install notes.
&gt;

What would this have to do with JACK?


&gt;
&gt; Also, write a few tutorials on how to write plugins for a drum sequencer
&gt; and drum synth like a soviet March UDS
&gt;

JACK has nothing do with plugins.


&gt;
&gt; ALso, write an access virus B tutorial and a memorymoog tutorial
&gt;

This has nothing to do with JACK.


&gt;
&gt; and write some serious compressors and a mixer software
&gt;

There are several excellent libre compressor plugins in LV2 format. Mixing
software varies from the trivial to the deeply complex.


&gt; tutorials are important, as are device drivers. audio and im trying to get
&gt; pygame to be used as one game engine, they would be intersting projects and
&gt; useful
&gt;

I have no idea why you sent this mail to the JACK mailing list.
