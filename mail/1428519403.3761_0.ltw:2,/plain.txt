That would completely orthogonal to JACK.

JACK accepts 32 bit floating point data. It doesn't care what that data is.
You can encrypt and decrypt it outside of JACK with no effects on JACK
whatsoever (other than that other clients would just play noise if they
connected to the data stream.

We would never consider adding encryption inside the JACK server itself.
