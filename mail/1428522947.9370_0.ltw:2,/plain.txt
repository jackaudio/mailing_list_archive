These clients will simply forward zyn's output to the respective ringbuffer.

So the sequencer gets one more jack client, which is connected to the sequencer's out ports. This client must call process() to do everything except feeding the ringbuffers, e.g.:

I try to understand your plan:

simple data flow example:

zynaddsubfx_1_output
          |
          V
sequencer_client_1_input
          |
          V
sequencer_input_ringbuffer
          |
          V
(sequencer processing stuff)
          |
          V
sequencer_output_ringbuffer
          |
          V
sequencer_client_output
          |
          V
system_client_input(hardware output)

Could you explain the dataflow you are planning in some kind of...
picture? Maybe also what you envision to happen in which thread or which
callback? I am quite unsure how your vision for this looks like, or how
the interface between JACK and your sequencer is supposed to behave.

Do you want to do some signal processing in your sequencer or would it
be ok to delegate this to other jack clients? (may be easier)
