&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I try to understand your plan:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; simple data flow example:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; zynaddsubfx_1_output
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;           V
&gt;&gt; sequencer_client_1_input
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;           V
&gt;&gt; sequencer_input_ringbuffer
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;           V
&gt;&gt; (sequencer processing stuff)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;           V
&gt;&gt; sequencer_output_ringbuffer
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;           V
&gt;&gt; sequencer_client_output
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;           V
&gt;&gt; system_client_input(hardware output)
&gt; 
&gt; Your picture is indeed correct. To add some more examples:
&gt; 
&gt;   * Something like this is also possible
&gt; 
&gt;         sequencer_input_ringbuffer_1     sequencer_input_ringbuffer_2
&gt;                 V                                V
&gt;         plus (i.e. addition of sound-waves)
&gt;                 V
&gt;         plus_effect_ringbuffer
&gt; 
&gt;   * The part that you labeled "(sequencer processing stuff)" might be filled with:
&gt; 
&gt;                 V
&gt;         peak_controller_effect        some lfo generator
&gt;                 V (lfo)                       V (lfo)
&gt;         zynaddsubfx_2_volume_input    zynaddsubfx_2_filter_freq_input
&gt;                 V
&gt;         (zynaddsubfx_2)
&gt;                 V
&gt;         zynaddsubfx_2_output
&gt;                 V
&gt;         sequencer_client_2_input
&gt;                 V
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Maybe also what you envision to happen in which thread or which
&gt;&gt; callback?
&gt; 
&gt; Let's take the second example. zynaddsubfx itself is in another process, so we don't need to run this at all. For feeding each ringbuffer from zyn, I planned to use a separate jack client. E.g., if process() of sequencer_client_1_input is being called, it simply copies "nframes" into sequencer_input_ringbuffer.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything that now remains (e.g. lfo generator, peak_controller_effect, sending input to zynaddsubfx_2) is done by a process() callback of sequencer_client_output. I call this one the master jack client.
&gt; 
&gt; About the problem:
&gt; 
&gt; A point where I think spinlocks can't be avoided would be, e.g., reading from sequencer_output_ringbuffer. The sequencer's master jack client would need to do that in process(), but it can not guess when the ringbuffer reader from sequencer_client_2_input has even started to feed the ringbuffer.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Do you want to do some signal processing in your sequencer or would it
&gt;&gt; be ok to delegate this to other jack clients? (may be easier)
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully you got it from the explenations above: the master jack client would do this right now, as I planned. Other ideas will be fine, too. Though, I guess, for "some lfo generator", e.g., a separate jack client would be overkill, as this generator simply does, e.g., f(x) = sin(x).
&gt; 

The lfo input for zyn nr 2
So a part of the dependencies in the signal processing flow is only
known to your sequencer, which leads to a situation where jack can not
know, if all dependencies for running a certain client process function
are satisfied?
I personally would try to avoid that so that things will become easier,
which means no need for ringbuffers (input and output buffers that
depend on each other are passed together to the process function) and
spinlocks (jack always calls the clients callback, if data is definitely
available) for synchronization.

Not sure if this helps much, I hope it does :)
