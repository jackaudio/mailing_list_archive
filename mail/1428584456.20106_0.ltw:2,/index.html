Speaking entirely personally, I think this design is just plain nuts. I
know there are some JACK-ecosystem developers who disagree with me, but I
think that using JACK clients for this purpose is just wrong and is pushing
the design scope for JACK.

What you're doing is precisely what a plugin architecture was intended to
address, and I really think you'd be better off implementing your own audio
graph with plugins. Of course, that requires a version of zyn that can run
as a plugin, which I think has been discussed but I don't think it was
every implemented fully.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I try to understand your plan:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; simple data flow example:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; zynaddsubfx_1_output
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;           V
&gt; &gt; sequencer_client_1_input
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;           V
&gt; &gt; sequencer_input_ringbuffer
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;           V
&gt; &gt; (sequencer processing stuff)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;           V
&gt; &gt; sequencer_output_ringbuffer
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;           V
&gt; &gt; sequencer_client_output
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;           V
&gt; &gt; system_client_input(hardware output)
&gt;
&gt; Your picture is indeed correct. To add some more examples:
&gt;
&gt;   * Something like this is also possible
&gt;
&gt;         sequencer_input_ringbuffer_1     sequencer_input_ringbuffer_2
&gt;                 V                                V
&gt;         plus (i.e. addition of sound-waves)
&gt;                 V
&gt;         plus_effect_ringbuffer
&gt;
&gt;   * The part that you labeled "(sequencer processing stuff)" might be
&gt; filled with:
&gt;
&gt;                 V
&gt;         peak_controller_effect        some lfo generator
&gt;                 V (lfo)                       V (lfo)
&gt;         zynaddsubfx_2_volume_input    zynaddsubfx_2_filter_freq_input
&gt;                 V
&gt;         (zynaddsubfx_2)
&gt;                 V
&gt;         zynaddsubfx_2_output
&gt;                 V
&gt;         sequencer_client_2_input
&gt;                 V
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe also what you envision to happen in which thread or which
&gt; &gt; callback?
&gt;
&gt; Let's take the second example. zynaddsubfx itself is in another process,
&gt; so we don't need to run this at all. For feeding each ringbuffer from zyn,
&gt; I planned to use a separate jack client. E.g., if process() of
&gt; sequencer_client_1_input is being called, it simply copies "nframes" into
&gt; sequencer_input_ringbuffer.
&gt;
&gt; Everything that now remains (e.g. lfo generator, peak_controller_effect,
&gt; sending input to zynaddsubfx_2) is done by a process() callback of
&gt; sequencer_client_output. I call this one the master jack client.
&gt;
&gt; About the problem:
&gt;
&gt; A point where I think spinlocks can't be avoided would be, e.g., reading
&gt; from sequencer_output_ringbuffer. The sequencer's master jack client would
&gt; need to do that in process(), but it can not guess when the ringbuffer
&gt; reader from sequencer_client_2_input has even started to feed the
&gt; ringbuffer.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you want to do some signal processing in your sequencer or would it
&gt; &gt; be ok to delegate this to other jack clients? (may be easier)
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully you got it from the explenations above: the master jack client
&gt; would do this right now, as I planned. Other ideas will be fine, too.
&gt; Though, I guess, for "some lfo generator", e.g., a separate jack client
&gt; would be overkill, as this generator simply does, e.g., f(x) = sin(x).
