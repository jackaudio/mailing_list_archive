Need to ask once more. Assuming I'll do this - one jack client and zynaddsubfx as a plugin. Nonetheless, if I have 40 instances of zyn, I'd like to (actually must) compute them concurrently. So how to do this with one client?

The best way I can see is using an array of jack clients, and hoping they'll process() at the same time. However, this sounds very tricky...
