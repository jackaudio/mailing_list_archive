&gt; &gt; &gt; Nonetheless, if I have 40 instances of zyn, I'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; like to (actually must) compute them concurrently. So how to do this
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; one client?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; By using your own internal graph mechanism that has parallel
&gt; capabilities.
&gt; &gt; See, for excample, https://github.com/flowprogramming/dspatch
&gt;
&gt; This one is based on pthread_cond_wait(), which is either implemented as a
&gt; spinlock or not realtime safe (I guess the second). So how can this help?
&gt;

it was just an example. ultimately, *some* synchronization primitive is
required. the question is what is the least bad choice ....


&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The best way I can see is using an array of jack clients, and hoping
&gt; &gt; &gt; they'll process() at the same time. However, this sounds very tricky...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There can be very good reasons for using JACK 1. If a user is doing that,
&gt; &gt; you won't get any parallelization at all.
&gt;
&gt; Does JACK 2 allow to use multiple jack clients that call process() at the
&gt; same time? Or does it allow to enter process() with multiple threads? There
&gt; seems to be no documentation/tutorial about JACK 2.
&gt;

clients do not "call process". process() is called on their behalf, by the
server, in a thread chosen by the server.

the relationship between threads and callbacks is an undocumented,
implementation specific part of JACK, and differs between JACK1 and JACK2.
