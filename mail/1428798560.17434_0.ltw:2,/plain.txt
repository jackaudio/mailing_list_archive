> To ease packaging jack2, its build system has received a major update [1]. The initial intent was to simply remove automagic dependencies (on celt, opus, libsamplerate, libsndfile, readline), which are bad [2] for source based distributions, such as Gentoo, but after a discussion [3] the decision was taken to reimplement all options that have third-party dependencies using a special option class, so that the build system by default builds against foo if available, refrains from doing so if --foo=no is given and if --foo=yes the dependency is hard-required. To preserve backwards compatibility (and save time writing "=yes") --foo is the same as --foo=yes.

This eases packaging (and cross-compiling) somewhat. Also the check for readline has been improved (it now checks for header existence too instead of just library existence), in effect making it easier to compile jack2 on binary distros (where the library existence does not imply header existence). (Correct me if I'm wrong; I have not compiled jack2 on a binary distro.)

Some option have not been tested at all since I lack the prerequisites, these options are --iio, --portaudio and --winmme, but since all option use the same class the logic should be the same, so they should work, but you can never be too sure.

Is the windows specific stuff actually needed to be tested? Waf builds
on windows doesn't seem to work (for me) anyway. I think I remember
widows builds are only done with a Code::Blocks IDE project? Or does
anyone cross compile for windows?
