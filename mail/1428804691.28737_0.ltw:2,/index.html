&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [This part is technical and can be skipped, if you like]
&gt; &gt; To ease packaging jack2, its build system has received a major update
&gt; [1]. The initial intent was to simply remove automagic dependencies (on
&gt; celt, opus, libsamplerate, libsndfile, readline), which are bad [2] for
&gt; source based distributions, such as Gentoo, but after a discussion [3] the
&gt; decision was taken to reimplement all options that have third-party
&gt; dependencies using a special option class, so that the build system by
&gt; default builds against foo if available, refrains from doing so if --foo=no
&gt; is given and if --foo=yes the dependency is hard-required. To preserve
&gt; backwards compatibility (and save time writing "=yes") --foo is the same as
&gt; --foo=yes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Apart from this change pkg-config is now used whenever possible instead
&gt; of only header checks. (It is bad to just check for headers without
&gt; checking for the accompanying library.) This eases packaging (and
&gt; cross-compiling) somewhat. Also the check for readline has been improved
&gt; (it now checks for header existence too instead of just library existence),
&gt; in effect making it easier to compile jack2 on binary distros (where the
&gt; library existence does not imply header existence). (Correct me if I'm
&gt; wrong; I have not compiled jack2 on a binary distro.)
&gt; &gt; [End of skip part]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So apart from the above points, what are the goodies for actual users?
&gt; Well, now users do not have to explicitly state --alsa, --firewire or such
&gt; to get the correct backend built since it will be automatically detected if
&gt; --alsa, --firewire, etc. is not given.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now the important part. Like with all big software changes, this might
&gt; introduce some bugs that I have not found during testing. (I did test the
&gt; option I could with both --foo=yes and --foo=no!) Some option have not been
&gt; tested at all since I lack the prerequisites, these options are --iio,
&gt; --portaudio and --winmme, but since all option use the same class the logic
&gt; should be the same, so they should work, but you can never be too sure.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In conclusion, I want you to be on the lookout for bugs or weird stuff
&gt; (as always!) when building jack2. Report the bugs and I will do my very
&gt; best to squash them!

&gt;
&gt; Is the windows specific stuff actually needed to be tested? Waf builds
&gt; on windows doesn't seem to work (for me) anyway. I think I remember
&gt; widows builds are only done with a Code::Blocks IDE project? Or does
&gt; anyone cross compile for windows?
&gt;

I added the windows based waf build a few years ago for cross compiling
jack2 on Fedora. It is not the build system used for the official windows
builds.

I now also use it for compiling on windows using MSYS2/mingw-w64 build
environment:

https://github.com/mojofunk/MINGW-packages/tree/newpkgs/mingw-w64-jack

So I haven't tested it with any other configuration or with these recent
changes, so if there is a call to remove it from the waf build I am fine
with that.

In saying that I think that MSYS2 is a pretty good environment for building
software on windows so if there is any interest to support a MSYS2 build I
can submit patches to fix it up.
