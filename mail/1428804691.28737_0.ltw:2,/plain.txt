I added the windows based waf build a few years ago for cross compiling
jack2 on Fedora. It is not the build system used for the official windows
builds.

I now also use it for compiling on windows using MSYS2/mingw-w64 build
environment:

https://github.com/mojofunk/MINGW-packages/tree/newpkgs/mingw-w64-jack

So I haven't tested it with any other configuration or with these recent
changes, so if there is a call to remove it from the waf build I am fine
with that.

In saying that I think that MSYS2 is a pretty good environment for building
software on windows so if there is any interest to support a MSYS2 build I
can submit patches to fix it up.
