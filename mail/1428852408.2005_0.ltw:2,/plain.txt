Take any JACK client code example and start thinking of "bytes" that are
processed at the ports. It could be anything, including your event (that
might be very use-case dependent). For simple stuff, explicit MIDI ports
can be used. You could also use OSC as a container to push custom data
structures around in JACK for pseudo communication between clients.
