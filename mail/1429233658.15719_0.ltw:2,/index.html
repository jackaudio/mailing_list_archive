Hello,

I have downloaded, built and installed the latest version of Jack on a 
Raspberry PI 2 running Raspbian (Linux 3.18.11-v7+ #777 SMP PREEMPT).

ron@squireoaksfarm-radio ~/src/quick2wire-python-api $ jackd --version

I have been all over the internet trying to find a solution to the 
following error that prevents the jack server from starting (using 
qjackctl):


10:31:31.869 Patchbay deactivated.

I have tried to start the sever with the "--no-mlock" option.
Here are the contents of audio.conf
ron@squireoaksfarm-radio /etc/security/limits.d $ more audio.conf
# Provided by the jackd package.
#
# Changes to this file will be preserved.
#
# If you want to enable/disable realtime permissions, run
#
#    dpkg-reconfigure -p high jackd

@audio   -  rtprio     95
@audio   -  memlock    unlimited
#@audio   -  nice      -19

Please help,
