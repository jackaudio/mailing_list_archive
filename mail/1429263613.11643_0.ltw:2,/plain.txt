Subject:     [Jack-Devel] running jackd from rc.local

Hi all,
I am trying to run jackd instance from /etc/rc.local (along with a few
other applications) from a custom made init script.

The system is ubuntustudio and I have setup everything to have elevated
permissions when executing applications from the @audio group.

so when I am logged on, I see this:
nass@starkill:~$ ulimit -r -l
real-time priority              (-r) 95
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) unlimited

which is expected and I can execute the script I wrote.

but, when I execute my script from /etc/rc.local as
su - nass -c "ulimits -r -l cd audio_setup/scripts ; bash ./start_audio"
then my user does not (yet?) have elevated permissions.

real-time priority              (-r) 0
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64

is there a script I can run before my start_audio script to elevate my
permissions?

thank you
