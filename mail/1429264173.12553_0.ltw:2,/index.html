&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I have downloaded, built and installed the latest version of Jack on a

&gt; 

Hello Ron,

Did you also try with the version from the Raspbian repository? That
package is patched for use on ARM devices.

&gt; I have been all over the internet trying to find a solution to the
&gt; following error that prevents the jack server from starting (using

How much memory did you allocate to the GPU? You might want to check
here for a workaround:
http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/raspberrypi#running_jack

&gt; 
&gt; I have tried to start the sever with the "--no-mlock" option.
&gt; Here are the contents of audio.conf
&gt; ron@squireoaksfarm-radio /etc/security/limits.d $ more audio.conf
&gt; # Provided by the jackd package.
&gt; #
&gt; # Changes to this file will be preserved.
&gt; #
&gt; # If you want to enable/disable realtime permissions, run
&gt; #
&gt; #    dpkg-reconfigure -p high jackd
&gt; 
&gt; @audio   -  rtprio     95
&gt; @audio   -  memlock    unlimited
&gt; #@audio   -  nice      -19
