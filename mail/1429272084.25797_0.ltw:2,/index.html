Hi,
(I hope I am using email correctly.  This is the first time I have used 
an email list such as this)

First, let me say thanks to everyone that responded.  The web page link 
really helped.  I have not investigated installing the Raspberry repo of 
jack as of yet.  I will look into that a bit later.   For now I will 
stick with using the source I have from the jack website.

OK,  success (sort of).
I changed the shared memory size (/dev/shm) to 128M.  Now the jackd 
server starts and stay running.  However when using qjackctl I still 
receive the cannot lock memory message however as I said the server 
actually stays running.  Jackd message output:

07:36:18.155 Patchbay deactivated.
07:36:18.177 Statistics reset.
07:36:18.206 ALSA connection change.

BUT if I start jackd via a terminal session (cygwin terminal) and enter:

/usr/local/bin/jackd -r -dalsa -dhw:0 -r48000 -p1024 -n2
jackd responses with:

As you can see the jackd server does NOT report  can not lock memory.  
Why is this?

Also ASLA is reporting it can not open the device for capture.  Why is this?

Sorry, but I'm really new to sound and sound device management on 
Linux.  My ultimate goal is to get an application running that requires 
jack and this is my first stumbling block on on that path.
