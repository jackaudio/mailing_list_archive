&gt; Hi,

Hello Ron,

Top posting is discouraged, other than that all is well ;)

&gt; First, let me say thanks to everyone that responded.  The web page link
&gt; really helped.  I have not investigated installing the Raspberry repo of
&gt; jack as of yet.  I will look into that a bit later.   For now I will
&gt; stick with using the source I have from the jack website.
&gt; 
&gt; OK,  success (sort of).
&gt; I changed the shared memory size (/dev/shm) to 128M.  Now the jackd
&gt; server starts and stay running.  However when using qjackctl I still
&gt; receive the cannot lock memory message however as I said the server
&gt; actually stays running.  Jackd message output:
&gt; 
&gt; 07:36:18.155 Patchbay deactivated.

&gt; 
&gt; BUT if I start jackd via a terminal session (cygwin terminal) and enter:
&gt; 
&gt; /usr/local/bin/jackd -r -dalsa -dhw:0 -r48000 -p1024 -n2
&gt; jackd responses with:

&gt; 
&gt; As you can see the jackd server does NOT report  can not lock memory. 
&gt; Why is this?

Not sure, maybe because the desktop consumes a lot of memory.

&gt; 
&gt; Also ASLA is reporting it can not open the device for capture.  Why is
&gt; this?

Probably because you're using the onboard audio which doesn't do
capturing, only playback. You can circumvent this message by appending
your JACK command with -P.
Or are you using an USB interface that can capture?

&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, but I'm really new to sound and sound device management on
&gt; Linux.  My ultimate goal is to get an application running that requires
&gt; jack and this is my first stumbling block on on that path.

Which application is this about?
