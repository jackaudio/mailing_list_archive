Lots of good info, thanks.
I will certainly abandon the rc.local approach and try with autostart.
The pc I am refering to above is a jackd client, so the "system* hooks
connect to the jack master, that is why I need to enable the local
soundcards (on the jack client) through alsa_* . I shall change that to
zita_* as well.

yes ubuntu studio uses xfce4 . I shall try KXStudio as well :)

&gt;  hi all, continuing from a previous email where I try to start up
&gt;&gt; several audio applications from a custom init script , which is run
&gt;&gt; from rc.local,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I originally wanted to point out that the use of rc.local for this stuff
&gt; is discouraged, but you've just discovered this yourself now.
&gt;
&gt; You should really consider your approach and come up with something
&gt; else.
&gt;
&gt;  what could be conflicting here?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Everything. Your login manager is probably using the card.
&gt;
&gt; The whole concept of integrating desktop distros with rc.local for audio
&gt; is not going to fly, because the distros set device permissions based on
&gt; the logged in user.
&gt;
&gt; There might also be a system-wide pulseaudio daemon running, probably as
&gt; root. You might get away with pasuspender -- alsa_out, but I wouldn't be
&gt; surprised if not, unless you wrap your su call in pasuspender.
&gt;
&gt; Also note that you shouldn't be using alsa_in/out at all, use zita-a2j
&gt; and zita-j2a or use jackd-0.124.x where you can simply specify
&gt; additional cards:
&gt;
&gt;    $ jackd -A Intel -d alsa -d hw:DSP24,0
&gt;
&gt; I don't know what you're trying to achieve, but I see mostly two
&gt; options:
&gt;
&gt;   (a) if you don't need a desktop, don't use one.
&gt;   (b) if you do need a desktop, use their autostart features
&gt;
&gt; For (b): You can have auto-login for a certain user. You can have
&gt; autostart for this user. Just run your script from the usual XDG
&gt; directories (or however your distro implements autostart).
&gt;
&gt; Also consider switching to KXstudio - a lot of work went into it to make
&gt; things work. An integration effort other distros never bothered to do.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
