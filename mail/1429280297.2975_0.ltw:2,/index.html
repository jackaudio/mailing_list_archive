&gt;&gt; I know little about pam.d because I mostly use slackware. so may I ask:

&gt;&gt; if this code snippet was commented out up until now, who/what givew me

&gt; hi all, continuing from a previous email where I try to start up several
&gt; audio applications from a custom init script , which is run from rc.local,
&gt; I noticed that I get several
&gt; Capture open error: Device or resource busy
&gt; error messages for the alsa_(in|out) instances I set up:
&gt;
&gt; alsa_out -d hw:DSP24,0 -c 10 -j dsp_out -r 48000 -p128 -n2 &amp;
&gt; alsa_in -d hw:DSP24,0 -c 12 -j dsp_in -r 48000 -p128 -n2 &amp;
&gt; alsa_out -d hw:Intel -c 8 -j hda_out -r 48000 -p128 -n3 &amp;
&gt; alsa_in -d hw:Intel -c 2 -j hda_in -r 48000 -p128 -n3 &amp;
&gt;
&gt; These work when I use the script manually by logging in the pc.
&gt; but from rc.local the seems to be a problem with alsa.
&gt; on some reboots, perhaps one (random) of these will work , but usually non
&gt; of the 4 will be loaded correctly.
&gt;
&gt; what could be conflicting here?

&gt;
&gt; You should really consider your approach and come up with something
&gt; else.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; what could be conflicting here?
&gt; Everything. Your login manager is probably using the card.
&gt;
&gt; The whole concept of integrating desktop distros with rc.local for audio
&gt; is not going to fly, because the distros set device permissions based on
&gt; the logged in user.
&gt;
&gt; There might also be a system-wide pulseaudio daemon running, probably as
&gt; root. You might get away with pasuspender -- alsa_out, but I wouldn't be
&gt; surprised if not, unless you wrap your su call in pasuspender.
&gt;
&gt; Also note that you shouldn't be using alsa_in/out at all, use zita-a2j
&gt; and zita-j2a or use jackd-0.124.x where you can simply specify
&gt; additional cards:
&gt;
&gt;      $ jackd -A Intel -d alsa -d hw:DSP24,0
&gt;
&gt; I don't know what you're trying to achieve, but I see mostly two
&gt; options:
&gt;
&gt;     (a) if you don't need a desktop, don't use one.
&gt;     (b) if you do need a desktop, use their autostart features
&gt;
&gt; For (b): You can have auto-login for a certain user. You can have
&gt; autostart for this user. Just run your script from the usual XDG
&gt; directories (or however your distro implements autostart).
&gt;
&gt; Also consider switching to KXstudio - a lot of work went into it to make
&gt; things work. An integration effort other distros never bothered to do.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers

&gt; Hi,
&gt; (I hope I am using email correctly.  This is the first time I have used
&gt; an email list such as this)
&gt;
&gt; First, let me say thanks to everyone that responded.  The web page link
&gt; really helped.  I have not investigated installing the Raspberry repo of
&gt; jack as of yet.  I will look into that a bit later.   For now I will
&gt; stick with using the source I have from the jack website.
&gt;
&gt; OK,  success (sort of).
&gt; I changed the shared memory size (/dev/shm) to 128M.  Now the jackd
&gt; server starts and stay running.  However when using qjackctl I still
&gt; receive the cannot lock memory message however as I said the server
&gt; actually stays running.  Jackd message output:

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also ASLA is reporting it can not open the device for capture.  Why is
&gt;&gt; this?
&gt; Probably because you're using the onboard audio which doesn't do
&gt; capturing, only playback. You can circumvent this message by appending
&gt; your JACK command with -P.
&gt; Or are you using an USB interface that can capture?

&gt;
&gt; Lots of good info, thanks.
&gt; I will certainly abandon the rc.local approach and try with autostart.
&gt; The pc I am refering to above is a jackd client, so the "system* hooks
&gt; connect to the jack master, that is why I need to enable the local
&gt; soundcards (on the jack client) through alsa_* . I shall change that to
&gt; zita_* as well.
&gt;
&gt; yes ubuntu studio uses xfce4 . I shall try KXStudio as well :)

&gt;&gt; is discouraged, but you've just discovered this yourself now.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You should really consider your approach and come up with something
&gt;&gt; else.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   what could be conflicting here?
&gt;&gt; Everything. Your login manager is probably using the card.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The whole concept of integrating desktop distros with rc.local for audio
&gt;&gt; is not going to fly, because the distros set device permissions based on
&gt;&gt; the logged in user.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There might also be a system-wide pulseaudio daemon running, probably as
&gt;&gt; root. You might get away with pasuspender -- alsa_out, but I wouldn't be
&gt;&gt; surprised if not, unless you wrap your su call in pasuspender.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also note that you shouldn't be using alsa_in/out at all, use zita-a2j
&gt;&gt; and zita-j2a or use jackd-0.124.x where you can simply specify
&gt;&gt; additional cards:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     $ jackd -A Intel -d alsa -d hw:DSP24,0
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't know what you're trying to achieve, but I see mostly two
&gt;&gt; options:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    (a) if you don't need a desktop, don't use one.
&gt;&gt;    (b) if you do need a desktop, use their autostart features
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For (b): You can have auto-login for a certain user. You can have
&gt;&gt; autostart for this user. Just run your script from the usual XDG
&gt;&gt; directories (or however your distro implements autostart).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also consider switching to KXstudio - a lot of work went into it to make
&gt;&gt; things work. An integration effort other distros never bothered to do.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers

HI, I hope I'm using the email correctly now.  Thanks.

OK, yes I'm thick as a brick some times.  Yes,  the bcm2835 sound device 
only has output.  Doh!
gpu_mem=16.  However I had it as high as 128M and it made no difference.

The application is an amateur radio application called OpenExpertSDR.   
Source located here: https://github.com/florintanasa/OpenExpertSDR.   
Originally the application was using portaudio to communicate with sound 
devices, but then the author decided to change to Jack.  I don't have a 
clue why.
Trust me,  Jack has been the lesser of problems while attempting to 
build this application.  It requires Qt5 which is not available with 
Raspbian (as yet).  Building Qt5 from source has been a real challenge. 
   I have been to the depths of dependance hell and back again.

Once I have all the bugs worked out, I will then install a USB sound 
card.  Hopefully configuring it will not be as much as a challenge as 
getting the rest of the stuff working has been.

Thanks very much for your help,
Ron
