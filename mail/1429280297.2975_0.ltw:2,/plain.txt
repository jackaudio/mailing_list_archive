HI, I hope I'm using the email correctly now.  Thanks.

OK, yes I'm thick as a brick some times.  Yes,  the bcm2835 sound device 
only has output.  Doh!
gpu_mem=16.  However I had it as high as 128M and it made no difference.

The application is an amateur radio application called OpenExpertSDR.   
Source located here: https://github.com/florintanasa/OpenExpertSDR.   
Originally the application was using portaudio to communicate with sound 
devices, but then the author decided to change to Jack.  I don't have a 
clue why.
Trust me,  Jack has been the lesser of problems while attempting to 
build this application.  It requires Qt5 which is not available with 
Raspbian (as yet).  Building Qt5 from source has been a real challenge. 
   I have been to the depths of dependance hell and back again.

Once I have all the bugs worked out, I will then install a USB sound 
card.  Hopefully configuring it will not be as much as a challenge as 
getting the rest of the stuff working has been.

Thanks very much for your help,
Ron
