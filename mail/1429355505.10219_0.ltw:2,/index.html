Hi David,
 it appears that due to the nature of ubuntu* distros, I have given up the
notion of starting my audio application from within rc.local - I had
problems with alsa_(in|out) not being able to grab the soundcards in my
system.

it was suggested that I do it from my desktop environments autostart
features, but these are executed when I log in, whereas I want audio to
start up sometime during the boot process (as my user) but before I log in.
basically the idea is
-I press "power ON" button on the pc
-wait for pc to boot
-audio works through this pc

It is an audio routing workstation (and jack client) so it should normally
get audio from the jack master, do some processing and spit audio from the
soundcard i/o.

so starting everything as root with a proper init script is not in the
direction. but it appears "application autostart" is not effective either.

&gt; Really, the right thing to do here is to set JACK up as a system
&gt; service, with an init script, or whatever the systemd equivalent is, if
&gt; you're running systemd.
&gt;
&gt; What you're using now is not actually an init script, if you have to
&gt; call it from rc.local. Init scripts go in /etc/init.d, follow specific
&gt; conventions, and are symlinked into various targets so they run only in
&gt; the appropriate run levels.
&gt;
&gt; Here's a decent primer:

&gt; &gt; Hi Len,
&gt; &gt; unfortunately the .desktop file is not good for me.
&gt; &gt; it is only run after I have logged in, whereas I want my script to be
&gt; &gt; started as me, but before I log in.
&gt; &gt; Is there a way to achieve that, without resorting to autologin ?

&gt; &gt;         Hi all,
&gt; &gt;         I am trying to run jackd instance from /etc/rc.local (along with
&gt; &gt;         a few other
&gt; &gt;         applications) from a custom made init script.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         The system is ubuntustudio and I have setup everything to have
&gt; &gt;         elevated
&gt; &gt;         permissions when executing applications from the @audio group.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Are you really wanting to run audio while you are logged out? It
&gt; &gt;     would be much easier to add a desktop file to ~/.config/autostart/
&gt; &gt;     Like jackstart.desktop with something like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     [Desktop Entry]
&gt; &gt;     Encoding=UTF-8
&gt; &gt;     Version=0.9.4
&gt; &gt;     Type=Application
&gt; &gt;     Name=AutoJack
&gt; &gt;     Comment=Jackdbus starter
&gt; &gt;     Exec=jack_control start
&gt; &gt;     StartupNotify=false
&gt; &gt;     Terminal=false
&gt; &gt;     Hidden=false
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Change the Exec to point to a script if you want to add config
&gt; &gt;     options, or use jackd instead of jack_control if you don't care
&gt; &gt;     about PA-jack bridging.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     This will have jack runnning from login.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     If you want to headless operation then have rc.local do it as the
&gt; &gt;     user that will run this stuff.
