Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] [LAU] running jackd from rc.local

I don't want to start it as a system service,
I don't even run it automatically through dbus.

I am using a repackaged, more recent version than the one found in the
ubuntu repository in order to have same versions between windows and linux
jackd2 versions.
