Look. You're trying to have JACK be available and waiting for you before
you log in. That's just not what JACK was designed for.

Starting it through rc.local won't work, because the sound card isn't
available yet. That leaves two options: auto-login, and a system service
/ init script. A different way of starting something before login will
not pop into existence because you want it. You must use what is available.

If I needed this, I would write an init script. Even though it's not how
JACK was meant to be run, it's possible, and it's not a dirty hack like
adding something to rc.local. It will never be portable, though, and it
will never handle changes in hardware or configuration gracefully. I
don't need this, because I use JACK the way it was designed: I log in,
start qjackctl, start JACK, then start my applications.

&gt; I am using a repackaged, more recent version than the one found in the
&gt; ubuntu repository in order to have same versions between windows and
&gt; linux jackd2 versions.

&gt; 
&gt;     JACK isn't designed to run as a system service. In the old days the JACK
&gt;     Debian package did come with an init script but that was removed because
&gt;     it simply didn't work. The best way is to start JACK once you're
&gt;     logged in.
