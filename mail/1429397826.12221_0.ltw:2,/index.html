Hi Len,
i am using ubuntu studio.
the pc i refer to is used for audio processing and routing primarily - it
is a jack client server.
so without any user intervention apart from powering it ON , it gets audio
through ethernet from the jack master, processes it and sends it out
through its local soundcards.
on occasions I want to log on and use this computer for local audio
capturing and / or playback. so jack would ideally run independent of a
user session. Having said that, I usually don't need to log out and back
in, I tend to lock the system as I am a single user. no need to deal with
multiple user case now.

I use a locally compiled jack2 version without dbus support because I had a
version mismatch between windows and linux jack.
some audio applications (namely calf) need an X server so in my custom
startup scripts I start a vnc session as well.

The problem as I understand it is that after log on, pam.d elevates logged
in user's privileges to access hardware. The main problem is that
alsa_(in|out) is can not grab the local soundcards... and I do not know
what could be the conflict. people over at jack-devel mailing list said it
could bea number of things like pulseaudio or lightdm....

there seems  to be a conflict or ideologies because some one suggests I
make a system init script and another says jack is not designed to run as a
system service.

Personally, I think that jack is indeed not designed as a system service,
but I could be wrong. what is more a jack run as root, would never be
available to applications that I would start as a user. is that so?

I think I replied to everything :)

&gt;  Hi Len,
&gt;&gt; unfortunately the .desktop file is not good for me.
&gt;&gt; it is only run after I have logged in, whereas I want my script to be
&gt;&gt; started as
&gt;&gt; me, but before I log in.
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to achieve that, without resorting to autologin ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; OK, perhaps a full description of what you are trying to acheive would
&gt; help. little bits of info I think I have put together include:
&gt;  - You will be using a DE at some point.
&gt;  - You want to be able to access jack after logging in as well as before
&gt;  - jack is still to be used only by one user
&gt;  - jack2 is prefered?
&gt;  - what would jack be doing while logged out I don't know
&gt;  - should jack continue to run after logout?
&gt;         (that is do you normally logout and in)
&gt;  - Is most of the running done by script anyway and loggin in is used
&gt; mostly for other things besides audio? Can all audio stuff be done by
&gt; command line?
&gt;  - will jack be used as a device for pulseaudio...
&gt;  - will pulse run at all? if so will it ever touch the same device as jack
&gt; has?
&gt;  - is your machine using sysv init, systemd, upstart? (upstart is going
&gt; away BTW, leaving one to wonder about the future of MIR)
&gt;
&gt; As Jeremy has already suggested have you tried:
&gt;
&gt; export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/dbus/system_bus_socket
&gt; jack_control start
&gt;
&gt; in the script run by your su user?
