I don't know how these things work on ARM systems, but if you 
reconfigure your realtime and memlock permissions (via 
/etc/security/limits.conf on usual systems), these changes will not 
affect the current session but require a re-login. This might explain 
why it's not working in the graphical environment (with a persistant 
session), and it does work on a new terminal.
Have you tried restarting the graphical session?
