Weird. Should be there. Did you check db.h (the system-wide file)? Mine
clearly has it.

Same here:

struct __dbc {
[..]
         /* DBC PUBLIC HANDLE LIST BEGIN */
         int (*close) __P((DBC *));
}

It's clearly there.

So either your include file is broken or it's not taken into
consideration.

You can pass -E to the gcc call (manually) and redirect the output to a
file, so you get the preprocessor out. Maybe as simple as this:

/* foo.c */
#include <db.h>


gcc - E foo.c

And there, you should see all the expanded struct __db{,c,t} things.


Good luck with hunting this down. ;)
