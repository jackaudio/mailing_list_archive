Subject:     [Jack-Devel] audioadapter.dll Crashing on Win 7 32bit

I'm having a DenverCoder9 week. I'm trying to do exactly what was asked here 2 years ago:
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.jackit/25893

Unfortunately, the discussion never ends with a report of success. Is it even possible?

Between that and info here:
https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2015/01/16/surround-sound-over-network-with-windows-8/
https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/WalkThrough_User_NetJack2

This is what my plan is:

JACK slave (on PC w/ speaker) Windows 7:

C: jackd.exe -R -S -d net
C: jack_load audioadapter
C: jack_connect netadapter:capture_1 system:playback_1
C: jack_connect netadapter:capture_2 system:playback_2


JACK master (Audio source/Line-In) Windows 7:

C: jackd.exe -R -S -d portaudio "ASIO::ASIO4ALL v2"
C: jack_load netadapter
In JackControl connect linein1->slave1
In JackControl connect linein2->slave2
In JackControl press the play button


I only get as far as the second step. When I try to jack_load audioadapter, 
Jackd says Waiting for a master...
Ringbugger automatic adaptive mode size =4096
MMCSS API not used...

and then Jackd crashes within a second with

Jack seems like the perfect way to stream low latency audio around my house. I hope it's just something simple that I'm doing wrong. Thanks guys!
