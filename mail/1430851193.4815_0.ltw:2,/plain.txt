Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Solving a problem with JACK

Hi there,
Not sure if this is really a JACK question, but I'll ask it to find out.
I have a problem with an older piece of audio hardware (an M-Audio Projectmix) and a Windows 8 PC. The Windows 7 drivers partially work - ASIO works OK, but I can't get the normal Windows audio output to address the Projectmix properly. Applications will attempt playback, but nothing appears on the M-Audio software metering and no sound is heard. There aren't likely to be any further driver updates for this hardware.
One solution that occurs is to use a piece of software to create a virtual audio device that Windows could address successfully, and pipe the results to the ASIO driver.
Is that something JACK could do?
Thanks,
Phil
