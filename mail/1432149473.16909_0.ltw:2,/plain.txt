Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Netjack 2: how to improve reliability by allowing greater latency?

Judging by the lack of replies, I guess this is not a use case that the
current netjack implementation supports right?

I don't know how much work would imply making netjack a viable solution for
WiFi streaming but if it is something relatively easy to do, it might be
interesting to explore that path considering the lack of alternatives for
"low latency" audio streaming, bad bluetooth audio quality and support,
proliferation of devices and omnipresence of WiFi networks across the globe.

Thank you all anyway for your work on Jack!
Cheers,
André
