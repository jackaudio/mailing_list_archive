Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Netjack 2: how to improve reliability by allowing greater latency?

I was hoping someone who knows more would chime in. It's been a LONG
time since I used Netjack, but I thought there was an option to add
extra periods of latency, specifically for what you're requesting? And
it was this capability that allowed some people back in the day to do
recording sessions internationally?

I can't test it right now, but if I get a chance tonight, I will. No
promises.
