Hi David,

Thanks for your reply. I think it is understandable that people didn't
reply to this topic as this is a feature described as not-supported on the
GitHub wiki page:

"Wireless and Internet use are not supported because they can't be
qualified as *realtime*. In Netjack, you can set a additional latency which
allow you to prevent from larger transmission delays, due to the use of
networks with some kind of *random delivery*, like wireless or Internet
networks. Netjack2 doesn't include this feature for now. That's why we
recommend the use of classical wired network."

https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/WalkThrough_User_NetJack2#2-requirements

I just went ahead anyway and tried my luck by compiling it with OPUS
support as I was also interested in learning a little bit more about
Jack/NetJack.

Nevertheless, if you end up trying it, please share your experience, but I
guess I will have to go with some other (less interesting) solution with a
different technology for my home wireless stereo system (probably KORUS
www.korussound.com that uses the patented SKAA technology and requires
additional dongles everywhere, which I was trying to avoid).

Thanks!

&gt; I was hoping someone who knows more would chime in. It's been a LONG
&gt; time since I used Netjack, but I thought there was an option to add
&gt; extra periods of latency, specifically for what you're requesting? And
&gt; it was this capability that allowed some people back in the day to do
&gt; recording sessions internationally?
&gt;
&gt; I can't test it right now, but if I get a chance tonight, I will. No
&gt; promises.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't know how much work would imply making netjack a viable solution
&gt; &gt; for WiFi streaming but if it is something relatively easy to do, it
&gt; &gt; might be interesting to explore that path considering the lack of
&gt; &gt; alternatives for "low latency" audio streaming, bad bluetooth audio
&gt; &gt; quality and support, proliferation of devices and omnipresence of WiFi
&gt; &gt; networks across the globe.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you all anyway for your work on Jack!

&gt; &gt;     Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I've been playing around with Jack/Netjack and the Opus codec in
&gt; &gt;     order to setup a "low latency" WiFi audio stream at home.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     After compiling Opus with custom modes and Jack2 with Opus support
&gt; &gt;     (both from the master branches of the respective repositories), I
&gt; &gt;     was able to run the Master-Slave setup:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Master.
&gt; &gt;     jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:1 -D=false -r44100 -S -n16
&gt; &gt;     jack_load netmanager
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Slave:
&gt; &gt;     jackd -R -d net -C0 -P2 -o0 -i0 -O320 -M1200 -l5
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     + jack_connect to route the net input on the master to the speakers
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     But as I was getting quite frequent audio deterioration, with the
&gt; &gt;     master showing messages like these:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Packet(s) missing from... -1 1
&gt; &gt;     Wrong packet type : a
&gt; &gt;     JackEngine::XRun: client = SLAVE_HOSTNAME was not finished, state =
&gt; &gt;     Running
&gt; &gt;     JackEngine::XRun: client netmanager finished after current callback
&gt; &gt;     JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; &gt;     Wrong packet type : a
&gt; &gt;     Packet(s) missing from... -1 1
&gt; &gt;     JackAudioDriver::ProcessGraphAsyncMaster: Process error
&gt; &gt;     JackEngine::XRun: client = SLAVE_HOSTNAME was not finished, state =
&gt; &gt;     Triggered
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I've thought that maybe I should just try increasing the network
&gt; &gt;     latency argument on the slave, as, for my use case, I'm happy with
&gt; &gt;     latency &lt; 200 ms.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     By using something like -l30 (the maximum I'm allowed to set) on the
&gt; &gt;     slave I was able to greatly diminish the Process errors (I still get
&gt; &gt;     the same lots of wrong packet type and packet missing messages
&gt; &gt;     though) but it didn't fix the audio artifacts. Actually sometimes
&gt; &gt;     this change makes the playback even worse with ms pauses every
&gt; second.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     So I would like to know if there is any other way to relax the low
&gt; &gt;     latency requirement in order to improve playback reliability. Or is
&gt; &gt;     there some kind of incompatibility in the configuration I'm passing
&gt; &gt;     to both endpoints that is causing these problems?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Thanks!
&gt; &gt;     Andr&#xE9;.
