You are looking for jack-devel@. CCed now.

And the answer is no, JACK does not control application level volume, it
just forwards and merges audio streams.

If you want volume control, use a mixer (maybe one of not too many
jack-based mixers), so you can adjust each jack client's volume in one
place.
