i'm asking those questions because, since today, i can't use a game engine named Godot : http://www.godotengine.org/ - it crashes on startup, and it will only launch when i uninstall Jack. The weird thing is that i had Jack installed alongside Godot on my system for some time now. I also tried launching old versions of Godot, and they all crash with a similar looking crashlog.
Plus after uninstalling Jack, when emptying the thrash, i get blocked because Jackmp.framework is in use by something in my system - i don't know what.
I just tried reinstalling Jack, Godot crashes on launch, uninstalled it, Godot doesn't crash.
I installed updates from Apple this weekend concerning commandline tools and XCode and Apple Remote Desktop, so i don't if something could come from here.. I also installed linux-sampler as described here : https://bugs.linuxsampler.org/cgi-bin/show_bug.cgi?id=240 so maybe a conflict there ?... anyway i attach a crashlog, it might be more informative than my babbling...
sorry for the flood, thanks in advance

Hey,

I was wondering, seeing as the latest distributed compiled package (on http://jackaudio.org/downloads/) for osx is version 0.90, and it is stated as beeing for Snow Leopard ; was wondering if i should try to compile it myself from the 1.9.10 tarball (or even the git repos ?) ; because i'm not very knowledgeable in coding so i'm afraid i have no idea how to compile it. Opening the xcode project in the git repo, then trying to compile it ; leads very fast to a critical " 'aften/aften.h' file not found" error ; and i don't see a "aften" file in the distribution.
In short, i do'nt know how stable is the 1.9.10 or Github version, but i'm not sure it is very wise either to use the maybe outdated 0.9 ? but for now, i don't know how i could do else...
Thanks in advance,
Victor
