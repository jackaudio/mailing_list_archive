The weird thing is that i had Jack installed alongside Godot on my system for some time now. I also tried launching old versions of Godot, and they all crash with a similar looking crashlog.

I also installed linux-sampler as described here : https://bugs.linuxsampler.org/cgi-bin/show_bug.cgi?id=240 so maybe a conflict there ?... anyway i attach a crashlog, it might be more informative than my babbling...

Opening the xcode project in the git repo, then trying to compile it ; leads very fast to a critical " 'aften/aften.h' file not found" error ; and i don't see a "aften" file in the distribution.
