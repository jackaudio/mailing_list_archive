My audio interface has no hardware mixer, so I asked for such a feature.
I'd appreciate a "master volume" in jackd, but no developer wants jackd
to deal with that.

I found a solution that works for me:

- I start a mixer, e.g. jack_mixer
- I start jack.plumbing with a ruleset that disconnects my jack clients
  (even ALSA-clients that use jack via .asoundrc) and connects them to
  jack_mixer's input. jack.plumbing stays active permanently in my
  X-session.

My ruleset (.jack.plumbing) looks like:

(connect    "alsa-jack\..*jackP\..*:out_000" "jack_mixer:ALSA L")
(connect    "alsa-jack\..*jackP\..*:out_001" "jack_mixer:ALSA R")
(disconnect "alsa-jack\..*jackP\..*:out_000" "system:playback_1")
(disconnect "alsa-jack\..*jackP\..*:out_001" "system:playback_2")

(connect    "Clementine:out_jackaudiosink-.*_1" "jack_mixer:JACK L")
(connect    "Clementine:out_jackaudiosink-.*_2" "jack_mixer:JACK R")
(disconnect "Clementine:out_jackaudiosink-.*_1" "system:playback_1")
(disconnect "Clementine:out_jackaudiosink-.*_2" "system:playback_2")

(connect    "Qtractor:Master/out_1" "jack_mixer:JACK L")
(connect    "Qtractor:Master/out_2" "jack_mixer:JACK R")
(disconnect "Qtractor:Master/out_1" "system:playback_1")
(disconnect "Qtractor:Master/out_2" "system:playback_2")

(connect    "rosegarden:master out L" "jack_mixer:JACK L")
(connect    "rosegarden:master out R" "jack_mixer:JACK R")
(disconnect "rosegarden:master out L" "system:playback_1")
(disconnect "rosegarden:master out R" "system:playback_2")

(connect    "MPlayer.*:out_0" "jack_mixer:ALSA L")
(connect    "MPlayer.*:out_1" "jack_mixer:ALSA R")
(disconnect "MPlayer.*:out_0" "system:playback_1")
(disconnect "MPlayer.*:out_1" "system:playback_2")

(connect "jack_mixer:MAIN L" "system:playback_1")
(connect "jack_mixer:MAIN R" "system:playback_2")
