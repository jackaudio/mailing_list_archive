You're confused.

JACK Command line structure:

    jackd [ server options ] -d [ backend name ] [ backend options ]

the same option may appear twice, once as a server option and once as a
backend option. The semantics of each appearance are totally different.

-l is both a server option (meaning: print out the location of the
directory where FIFOs exist to communicate with the the server), and an
option for the net1 backend (meaning: define the listen port for sync
packets).
