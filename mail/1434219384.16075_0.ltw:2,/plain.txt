The ABI of libjack on windows is not stable. Not only do the ordinals
differ with version but also depending on architecture.

MSVC has a workaround for this: link by function-name, not ordinal.
mingw does not offer this.

The solution adopted by Carla, Ardour and Mixbus is to simply dlopen()
uhm LoadLibraryA(), libjack at runtime, rather that link the application
against jack.

An easy way of doing so is provided at https://github.com/x42/weakjack/

best,
robin
