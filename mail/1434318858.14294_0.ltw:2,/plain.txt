the required libjack may not be installed on OSX.


On GNU/Linux *BSD etc, distros take care of installing libjack along
with apps that need jack.

On OSX that's not a given. Furthermore there are 32bit/64bit only
variants of jack-osx (IIRC you have the choice between 32bit Intel + PPC
vs 32 + 64bit Intel) the architecture may not match. An application
hard-linked against libjack may not start.

Also, if you use new features (eg. the metadata API), a user may have an
old[er] version installed that misses the symbols.

best,
