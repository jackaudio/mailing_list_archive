Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] About cross-compilation of jack2 in MXE and libportaudio

Tim, you rock!

Thank you for the explanation and the links! In a cross-compilation
environment like MXE such behaviour breaks the installation of portaudio.
If that could be avoided, it would be great. I may investigate it a bit
more.

Cheers!
Harry
