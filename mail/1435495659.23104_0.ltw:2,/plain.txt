Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] loopback

That command makes no sense at all.

I do use the ALSA loopback driver all the time. There is very
extensive documentation at:

http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_and_Loopback_device_as_Alsa-to-Jack_bridge

but for many people I suspect this is too long, too detailed, too
explanatory. I keep meaning to write up a short more "just do this"
document but have not done so yet.
