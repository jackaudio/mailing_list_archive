Ok, I see now that the BBT update algorithm (in the "else" branch in 
timebase()) in transport.c is quite broken, because it accumulates 
rounding errors. However always using the first, recalculating branch 
(basically: if (true)) seems to be stable -- or at least: better than 
Hydrogen's timebase master, which updates the BBT only every few 
cycles... (I've read that somewhere a completely rewritten Jack Master 
implementation for Hydrogen is available, which I have not tested yet).

I find it quite sad that even some code distributed in the jack tarball 
is an example of how NOT to use the Jack API ...
