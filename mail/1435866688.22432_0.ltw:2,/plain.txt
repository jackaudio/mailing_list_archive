Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Odp: Re: Odp: Re: jack1: jack_transport does not work as master

I send a patch once on this list and this is a "patched" version.
I keep this, because it was very helpfull while testing and improve other apps ( like hydrogen , fsthost ), especially tempo change issues. Not perfect but better than "official", especially in low tempos ( like 30 BPM ).
.. so yes you are inconvincible ;-)
