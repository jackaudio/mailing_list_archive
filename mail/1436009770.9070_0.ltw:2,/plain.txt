Subject:     [Jack-Devel] New build of QJackCtl for Windows

Hi all,

The build of qjackctl included with jackdmp for windows is getting really
old.
The biggest problem is that the default "startup time" is set too low,
making it
seem like "jack crashes". (I"ve got many complains that "jack crashes").
Another problem is that you manually have to append "-S" to the "Server
Prefix".

So here:

https://github.com/kmatheussen/qjackctl

...I've cloned the official qjackctl repository, fixed these two problems,
and added some files to make it straight forward to build qjackctl under
mingw32.
(Building is just running the "build_mingw32.sh" script)

Windows binary: http://folk.uio.no/~ksvalast/qjackctl.zip

Perhaps this build, or something similar, can be included in the next
release of jack for windows?
