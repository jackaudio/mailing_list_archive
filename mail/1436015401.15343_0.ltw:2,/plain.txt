Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] New build of QJackCtl for Windows

To be honest, I didn't try it myself. I just checked that it started using
wine.

There are three problems with it:

1. It doesn't find the jackd.exe binary. I don't know how the path is
handled
    in qjackctl under windows. Maybe the problem is that it was a 32 bit
build
    of qjackctl and a 64 bit build of jack?
2. Scanning for the available pulseaudio drivers takes many seconds.
    qjackctl freezes while this happens.
3. When choosing the direct sound primary sound driver (in many
    cases the most natural driver to try), jackd says (on one of my
computers) that
    it can't start the driver because of illegal input and output arguments
(I think).
    This information is written to the console. However, qjackctl just says
in the
    messages window that it crashed, and doesn't show the information
printed
    to the console. Perhaps it's not possible to redirect this information
to the
    messages window?
