Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] New build of QJackCtl for Windows

I've got it compiled down to an independent 14MB executable now (now dlls
required).

But I wonder if we should change the behavior on windows on where
to look for the jackd.exe executable... Now it checks in the path first,
and if it fails, it checks in the same directory as the qjackctl.exe
executable.

But can we do it the other way around? (I.e. look first in the same
directory).
If not, qjackctl.exe might use a jackd executable left over from another
installation, without the user noticing.
