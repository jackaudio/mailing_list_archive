In-Reply-To: Stéphane Letz Re: [Jack-Devel] New build of QJackCtl for Windows (1436014462.14299_0.ltw:2,)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] New build of QJackCtl for Windows

New versions  of qjackctl for windows:
http://folk.uio.no/~ksvalast/qjackctl.zip

* Both 32 bit and 64 bit version.
* No dlls required, or included
* Windows Icon
* Fixed stdout/stderr forwarding into the message window
* Don't write message that Jack crashed, when it was just stopped
* Include latest portaudio
* Changed the isExecutable() check into a exists() && isExecutable() check
  when searching through the path for jackd.exe.
* Use the portaudio driver by default. (not alsa)

To build qjackctl for mingw,  clone https://github.com/kmatheussen/qjackctl
and write either "./build_mingw.sh 32" or "./build_mingw.sh 64". Tested on
fedora 19 and 22.

Going to look through the commits later to find out what should be merged
upstream.
