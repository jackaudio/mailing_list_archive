Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [ANN] QjackCtl 0.4.0 is out!

Hi all,

as in through the hottest of summers--as southerners can't even 
wait--here comes part one:

   QjackCtl 0.4.0 (summer'15) is out!

though aside that everybody knows this already,

   QjackCtl is a (maybe not so any more but) simple Qt [3] application 
to control the JACK [2] sound server, for the Linux Audio infrastructure.

Change-log:
- Some windows fixes added (patch by Kjetil Matheussen, thanks).
- Most advanced Setup/Settings are moved into new Setup/Advanced 
settings tab; limit range for the real-time priority setting, now having 
6 as absolute minimum valid value (after patches by Robin Gareus, thanks).
- A new top-level widget window geometry state save and restore 
sub-routine is now in effect (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Delayed geometry setup for widget windows upon startup has been 
deprecated and scrapped altogether.
- Setup/settings dialog tab is going into some layout changes; also got 
rid of old patchbay auto-refresh timer cruft, which was previously 
hidden/disabled.
- New socket names are now automatically inferred from selected client 
names while on the Patchbay widget, Socket dialog.
- Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.
- German (de) translation update (by Guido Scholz, thanks).
