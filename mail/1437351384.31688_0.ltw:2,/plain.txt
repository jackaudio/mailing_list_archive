Thanks for the question.

Jack has network audio working well - this is a big bonus, as on these 
limited systems you can't do too much audio processing as they have 
limited resources and power.
Jack also uses LPC based compression over the network - which is 
lossless. That is normally a minimum of 2 times compression.

Can you tell me how you would approach this ? I understand that by 
getting rid of Jack, you would free up a large amount of already limited 
memory on these devices ... but how would you do network audio in a 
standard fashion ?

Matt
