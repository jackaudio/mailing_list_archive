Thank you very much. Is there any specific reason why you cannot
use the jack_cycle_* functions from another thread? Because it
appears to work perfectly, and it also works around the exception
problem, at lest as a temporary solution until the exception problem is
solved.

I'm doing it like this:

void *actual_rt_thread(void *arg){
   set_realtime_mode();
   while(true){
      jack_cycle_wait();
      ...
      jack_cycle_signal();
      ...
   }
}

void *jack_rt_thread(void *arg){
   wait_forever();
}

main(){
  jack_set_process_thread(jack_rt_thread);
  start_thread(actual_rt_thread);
  ...
}
