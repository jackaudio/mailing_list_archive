Hi there,

It is possible that netjack one should be more promiscuous ( 
indiscriminate = unselective = let anyone connect).

Take this scenario : we have a network of netjack one masters and want 
to connect to all of them and play all together at the same time.
Right now, it requires each of the netjack one masters to know the IP 
address of the person who wants to connect ... whilst this is secure, it 
is difficult to connect to many jackd masters without instructing each 
of them the host who wants to connect to them first ! This isn't 
practical for the broadcast scenario. It requires another piece of 
software or webapp which allows the slave to instruct the master it 
wants to connect ... allowing the master to initiate with the slave's 
hostname.

To recap the problem ...

netjack one is nicely secure in that the master controls who connects ( 
https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/WalkThrough_User_NetJack#all-set--lets-play- 
):
* Start jackd with a driver (e.g. alsa)
* Once the slave is running : jack_netsource -H host

Netjack2 doesn't have this broadcast problem ...

netjack two is promuscuous in that anyone can connect 
(https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/WalkThrough_User_NetJack2 
) :
* Start jackd with a driver (e.g. alsa)
* start up the netmanager : jack_load netmanager
* any host can connect

Does anyone have a premade software which solves this problem for 
netjack one ?
Should we consider adding a promiscuous mode to netjack one which allows 
anyone to connect ?

thanks
Matt
