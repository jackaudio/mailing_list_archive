You are most likely dealing with unaligned memory access here, usually
mis-aligned structs. I'm somewhat surprised that it didn't surface on
other ARM platforms before, but then again, there are many variations of
"ARM".

Further reading:

   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/mem_alignment

specifically:

   echo 1 > /proc/sys/debug/alignment

and then check the syslog.

If this confirms that it's unaligned access, you know what to look for.

A good and comprehensive read:

   http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/

Maybe "pahole" in the tools section can be of further help, but let's
not jump to conclusions.

I've only skimmed the following link, but it also seems like a good
introduction to memory alignment:

   https://lwn.net/Articles/259732/

In other words: set aside half a day for hunting this down.

Last not least: ARM behaviour may be different depending on the compiler
flags. I vaguely recall different CPU targets behaving differently. I
assume you used the correct flags that match your platform, endianess
etc.



Cheers
