Subject:     [Jack-Devel] jack1 and MIPS architecture

I can now start jackd 1 on a MIPS 24Kc architecture.

When I try to do anything - even probe the sample rate, it dies with Bus 
Error :
creating alsa driver ... hw:0|hw:0|1000|16|48000|0|2|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit

jack_samplerate ....
Bus error

Even when I use the dummy driver :
jackd -ddummy
creating dummy driver ... dummy_pcm|48000|1024|21333|2|2

jack_samplerate ....
Bus error

I have tried to use gdb and gdbserver, but it is non trivial as the 
binaries are stripped ... even when I use gdb remotely with a 
non-stripped binary, still don't get any sensible information.

I have run jackd with -v and here is what I get - bus error - when I run 
jack_lsp
