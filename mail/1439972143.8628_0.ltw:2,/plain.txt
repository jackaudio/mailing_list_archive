Good news,

It turns out these problems were because shm was on a very space 
restricted device ... I moved shm to the tmp directory and it is now 
functioning as it should.

jack1 on MIPS arch. is tested working.
I ran jackd 1 using 2ms latency, no xruns. That is with a 48kHz sample rate.

I played from my desktop using netjack one and I have seen the I2S data 
flowing out ... nice first test. When I get an audio codec connected I 
will do a listening test.
