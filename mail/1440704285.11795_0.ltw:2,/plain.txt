Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Status of cgroups support/coexistence?

On a Linux 4.2 system with realtime scheduling controlled by cgroups, what is
the current recommended strategy to get jackd working as a non-root user? 
There was an old wiki page,

https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/Cgroups

describing some built-in support (e.g. --with-default-cgroup configuration
switch).  But none of this is in the current git HEAD.  (I am using jack2
1.9.11.)

And a somewhat related question:  Is there currently support for running
jack as root and allowing client programs with multiple UIDs to connect?  I
tried following an old recipe using JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER, but it didn't
seem to make any difference; running jackd as root, only root can connect.

Regards,

Mark
