For the promiscuous mode to work, JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER should be set for
both server and clients, and the umask must be set to 0000 for both server
and clients (sockets and shm segments must be writable by all the
participants).
I made a patch to get rid of the (way too permissive) umask requirement :
