all true, although a port's flags do provide some indications:

     IsTerminal: this port represents the "edge" of JACK: data delivered or
received here
        comes from or goes to "outside" JACK
     IsPhysical: this port represents a hardware audio channel

there is also a metadata API that allows arbitrary information to be
associated with ports. Unfortunately, it has only been implemented for
JACK1 at this time.
