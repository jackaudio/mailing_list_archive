&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm wondering whether it's safe to do non-blocking reads or writes from
&gt;&gt;&gt; inside the process callback.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  From what I've seen, non-blocking I/O doesn't cause the process to go
&gt;&gt;&gt; into blocked state, and the realtime scheduler should not switch to
&gt;&gt;&gt; another process. But the documentation doesn't seem to allow them:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [...] it cannot call functions that might block for a long time. This
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; includes all I/O functions (disk, TTY, network), [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So, is it safe to use non-blocking I/O in the process callback?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On which platform?
&gt; 
&gt; This is going to run on UNIX-like systems, mostly Linux, and I'm
&gt; programming in C/C++.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The short answer is:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    "If you don&#x2019;t know how long it will take, don't do it." [1]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; All i/o involve syscalls, and then it depends what the kernel does for
&gt;&gt; the specific system call(s). Asynchronous I/O usually involves signals
&gt;&gt; at some point which makes it not safe to use.
&gt; 
&gt; I wasn't very specific, let me clarify: I'm only going to do some
&gt; read(2) or write(2) syscalls on an FD which has O_NONBLOCK set.
&gt; AFAIK these don't involve signals...

I'm pretty sure they do in the current Linux kernel. There'll be an IRQ
once the read is complete.

&gt;&gt; Some implementation also
&gt;&gt; involve mutexes to avoid resource conflicts. You'll have to check the
&gt;&gt; standard-lib and kernel source for the system that you target.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm... Are mutexes a problem if the FD is used exclusively from the
&gt; process callback?

How can you know that no other process is using the same file?

I have not checked the underlying implementation, but I can easily
imagine that there are locks in the kernel.


&gt;&gt; All moot anyway. Proper software needs to do error-handling and doing
&gt;&gt; that in a rt-callback is out of the question. So you need a non-realtime
&gt;&gt; thread anyway and if you have that you can directly do i/o there.
&gt; 
&gt; Error handling is not a problem here, if those syscalls fail I'll simply
&gt; deactivate the JACK client.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; anyway, using a ringbuffer to decouple i/o is trivial: e.g.
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/example-clients/blob/master/capture_client.c
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the advice, I'm currently using ringbuffers + worker threads
&gt; but being able to do this I/O directly in process() would simplify the
&gt; code considerably. I'll consider it, though.


Keep jack freewheeling in mind. When freewheeling the process callback
needs to wait for i/o to complete.

"worker thread" sounds like LV2. In this case you're good already since
the LV2 worker takes care of this.


On a different note: check async i/o performance first. Paul may chime
in later, I recall that he benchmarked single-threaded, thread-polls and
async i/o for Ardour at some point and opted for the first.

&gt; Thank you for your help,
&gt; Xavi
