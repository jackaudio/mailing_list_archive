Depends what you mean by safe. Unless you require quite low latency, for
instance less than 256 frames, and if your program is not supposed to run
simultaneously with hard realtime software such as ardour, calling I/O
functions in the jack thread should work fine. But you need to inform your
users that the program should not run simultaneously with hard realtime
software.
