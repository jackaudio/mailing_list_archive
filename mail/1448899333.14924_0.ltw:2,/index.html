&gt;     I have not checked the underlying implementation, but I can easily
&gt;     imagine that there are locks in the kernel.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; more than one. there are filesystem-level locks even if you avoid
&gt; per-file locks.

The FD is not expected to be a file, but a stream socket or a pipe.
But I understand there will be locks as well.

&gt;      &gt; Thanks for the advice, I'm currently using ringbuffers + worker
&gt;     threads
&gt;      &gt; but being able to do this I/O directly in process() would
&gt;     simplify the
&gt;      &gt; code considerably. I'll consider it, though.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; you absolutely should NOT do this. even if it works for you under some
&gt; conditions, it is absolutely the wrong design. no  matter how you try to
&gt; do it, you are moving all the data to disk from inside the process
&gt; callback. non-blocking (or even async) I/O might obscure the basic
&gt; problem with doing this, but obscuring it is all that it does. please
&gt; don't do this.
&gt;
&gt;     On a different note: check async i/o performance first. Paul may chime
&gt;     in later, I recall that he benchmarked single-threaded, thread-polls and
&gt;     async i/o for Ardour at some point and opted for the first.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i recently re-tested this, and amazingly continued to find that with at
&gt; least one test case (serially-written files, each 10MB, written
&gt; round-robin), the multithreaded version was slower than the
&gt; single-threaded one. multithreaded simulates non-blocking I/O by working
&gt; around the defects in the async I/O API available for linux and OS X. i
&gt; don't want to be too emphatic about this, because it needs more
&gt; evaluation with different test cases, but it was really quite suprising
&gt; to me that even that case didn't show improvement over the
&gt; single-threaded, blocking case.

Ok, all clear now. I'll use another worker thread, perform blocking I/O 
and write to a ringbuffer.

 &gt; Keep jack freewheeling in mind. When freewheeling the process callback
 &gt; needs to wait for i/o to complete.

Good point.
