there is a justification for this. your paragraph starts with the claim
that these short spikes correspond to xruns. there is a counter-claim that
they represent measurement error.

i'm in full agreement with your argument *if* it can be shown that the
spikes are not measurement errors (or, alternatively, that measurement
error is best excluded via a different heuristic).
