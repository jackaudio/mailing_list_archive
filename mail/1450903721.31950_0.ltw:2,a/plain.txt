Sidestepping from the discussion: Why not make more statistics
available. Or even better: Make the information to generate the
statistics available.

I.e. add a callback to provide measurements from the previous cycle.

Something like

jack_register_measurement_callback(void (f*)(jack_measurements*));

where jack_measurements is an opaque type with associated functions

uint64_t
jack_measurements_get_cycle_available_milliseconds(jack_measurements*);

uint64_t
jack_measurements_get_cycle_consumed_milliseconds(jack_measurements*);

where the former provides the available milliseconds for processing
the whole jack graph (maybe normalized by number of cpus (jack2) or
not (jack1)) and the latter provides the consumed milliseconds.

Units, function names, what measurements, etc, are subject to further
discussion, but this would allow different clients to provide the
statistics they need for their usecase.
