If jack can't keep track of the time properly we have much more serious
issues.

jackd on POSIX systems is robust. The time is queried in a high priority
thread and jack2 offers `--clocksource` for a user to tweak it if needed.

Yes, outliers - e.g jumps on suspend/resume or leap-seconds
(non-monotonic clock) must be skipped.

In Ardour we ended up ignoring negative deltas and jumps larger than 10
times the cycle-length. (This in particular is relevant for AMD machines
and Windows XP where the clock is per cpu-core.)

Early 4.X had a sigma-cut (based on running variance) but that turned
out too be too statistical for the case of displaying peak-computing power.

so long,
