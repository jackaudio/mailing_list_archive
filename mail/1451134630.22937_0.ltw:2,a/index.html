&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'd like to propose changing the algorithm how jack calculates the DSP
&gt;&gt; load from averaging to worst-case.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The main reason for having DSP load is to know how much more processing
&gt;&gt; one can safely add without getting x-runs. What matters in this case is
&gt;&gt; the worst-case value.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Matters to whom..?  

Those who want to know the peak DSP load and available headroom.

The average is meaningless in the context of DSP. A system may run
without x-runs 99% of the time but then some NMI or SMI comes along and
ruins it all. Nobody cares if the average is below 50%.

&gt; As one of the people who implemented the current scheme, let me
&gt; explain why it was needed...
&gt; 
&gt; We implemented the averaging mechanism when Harrison and I ported
&gt; their Mixbus DAW to Windows.  Windows isn't a real-time OS and one of
&gt; its drawbacks is that concurrently running apps can have an effect on
&gt; each other.  Not necessarily a detrimental effect - but an effect
&gt; nonetheless.

It's Mixbus that motivated me to looking into this, actually.  There are
forum reports: "DSP load is 40% and there are x-runs".

&gt; Before averaging, a concurrent (though unrelated) background app
&gt; could have a very noticeable effect on Mixbus's DSP reading.  A nice
&gt; reading of (say) 18% DSP could suddenly shoot up to 70% if the user
&gt; ran some other process in the background.  70% was perfectly
&gt; manageable - though pretty alarming for a user.

and rightfully so, what do we gain by hiding this?

If a user starts another application and that app steals time from
jack's realtime callback, that's what it is.

If there are regular spikes (quite common on windows), those spikes do
interfere with processing.

In your example, if the initial DSP load was 48%, it'll go over 100%
when the user starts something in the background.

This is the precise case that we're seeing currently: A user adds some
3rd part DSP. The load stays below 50% but there are regular
dropouts/crackles and only sometimes the DSP indicator goes "red" (&gt; 95%
in Mixbus) with jack.

Ardour's port-audio backend reports the peak and is always &gt; 90% in that
case. So the user switched to JACK because "jack has half the DSP load",
and the crackles are still there...


&gt; Currently, Jack DOES report the worst case value - IF - the worst 
&gt; case value is high enough to start causing problems (or if there's a
&gt; sustained sequence of high values).

No it does not. If that was the intent, it's an oversight or bug in the
current implementation. Two very unlikely conditions must coincide, and
there is always a low-pass filter at the end.

&gt; But if there's only an occasional high value (which is perfectly
&gt; manageable) then it just gets factored into the current average.

How can an occasional high value be perfectly manageable?

&gt; The advantage of this approach is that Mixbus's DSP reading remains unaffected by other running apps.

I see this as a disadvantage. Those other apps may affect audio-i/o and
cause spikes.

&gt; The threshold we chose was 95%.  So if any value is 95% or higher, the highest value will always get reported. 

What you describe does not match the current code in jack2.

Still the larger issue is the report-time. The peak is only held for 32
jack-cycles. It's worse since the final LPF ramps up and down and the
actual value. The report-time of the peak is commonly below 100ms.  That
is a very short time for any report to be interpreted by a human.


&gt; There's an argument for saying that we possibly set the bar too high
&gt; (at 95%) but I don't think there's anything else inherently wrong
&gt; with the current strategy.


The 95% cut is done before filtering and overrides other bins in the
history. I understand that parts of the strategy was to work around
issues with unreliable clocks on non-realtime OS - in particular
windows, but I think the situation can be improved.

My main criticism is that it's some homebrew statistics with no real
meaning. I don't know how to interpret the readout, nor see it useful
as-is, except maybe for marketing or for comparing machines against each
other or maybe even compete with other DSP software ("ours is lower on
average").

&gt; If people are getting xruns at DSP values lower than 95%, we perhaps just need to change the threshold.

How will that help?

One could argue that we may want two numbers: a true average and a peak
(maybe even user-resettable), although a slow fall-off is probably
preferable because there is already an independent x-run counter.

robin
