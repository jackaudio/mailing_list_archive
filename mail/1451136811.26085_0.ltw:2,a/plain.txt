For what it's worth, Radium reports three values: 1. Minimum CPU measured
for a block during the last second, 2. Average CPU usage during the last
second,
3. Maximum CPU usage measured for a block during the last second
( http://folk.uio.no/ksvalast/radiumcpu.png )

All three values are useful, at least for me as a developer of the program,
but I guess the users might find all three values interesting as well. At
least
the user doesn't have to wonder whether it's showing peak or average
values, and what the average/peak values would have been if only one
of them had been shown. I guess peak value is the most useful value,
but by showing average and minimum as well, we also indicate the potential
performance the program can deliver without xruns. This potential
can be used by the user to close other programs and do other operations
that might make the computer perform better.

One thing I'm not quite sure of, which is always apparent because all the
values are visible, is why there is such a large difference between
minimum and maximum CPU usage. It's usually at least 4-10
percentage points. I hope it's because of measurement
errors.
