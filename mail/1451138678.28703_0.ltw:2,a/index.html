&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd like to propose changing the algorithm how jack calculates the DSP
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; load from averaging to worst-case.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The main reason for having DSP load is to know how much more processing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one can safely add without getting x-runs. What matters in this case is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the worst-case value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Matters to whom..?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Those who want to know the peak DSP load and available headroom.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The average is meaningless in the context of DSP. A system may run
&gt;&gt; without x-runs 99% of the time but then some NMI or SMI comes along and
&gt;&gt; ruins it all. Nobody cares if the average is below 50%.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; For what it's worth, Radium reports three values: 1. Minimum CPU measured
&gt; for a block during the last second, 2. Average CPU usage during the last
&gt; second,
&gt; 3. Maximum CPU usage measured for a block during the last second
&gt; ( http://folk.uio.no/ksvalast/radiumcpu.png )

nice.

That is per application, right?  Not the whole system - jack can include
other clients.

&gt; All three values are useful, at least for me as a developer of the program,
&gt; but I guess the users might find all three values interesting as well. 

For end users in Mixbus  we are considering to maybe even "dumb it
down": A simple light: green/yellow/red or a short e.g 6-LED peak-meter.

The motivation here: don't encourage comparing percent values.

However it must be meaningful to answer
 1) can I safely add more plugins?
 2) can I lower the period-size or is the current cycle already very
short for my setup?

&gt; At least
&gt; the user doesn't have to wonder whether it's showing peak or average
&gt; values, and what the average/peak values would have been if only one
&gt; of them had been shown. I guess peak value is the most useful value,
&gt; but by showing average and minimum as well, we also indicate the potential
&gt; performance the program can deliver without xruns. This potential
&gt; can be used by the user to close other programs and do other operations
&gt; that might make the computer perform better.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I'm not quite sure of, which is always apparent because all the
&gt; values are visible, is why there is such a large difference between
&gt; minimum and maximum CPU usage. It's usually at least 4-10
&gt; percentage points. I hope it's because of measurement
&gt; errors.

On which platform is that? with JACK?

best,
robin
