nice.

That is per application, right?  Not the whole system - jack can include
other clients.

For end users in Mixbus  we are considering to maybe even "dumb it
down": A simple light: green/yellow/red or a short e.g 6-LED peak-meter.

The motivation here: don't encourage comparing percent values.

However it must be meaningful to answer
 1) can I safely add more plugins?
 2) can I lower the period-size or is the current cycle already very
short for my setup?

On which platform is that? with JACK?
