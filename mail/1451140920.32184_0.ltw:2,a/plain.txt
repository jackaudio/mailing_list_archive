This part is correct. The x-run counter increases correctly.

I think we're talking cross-purpose.

Effectively it boils down to this: Is the reported DSP load supposed to
be "average" or "worst-case" or a "hybrid" (current implementation)?

I like Nedko's idea: Allow to query all: min, average, max  over a long
time compared to the process-cycle (think second or seconds).

That leaves it to the application which of those are displayed to the
user, but at least the mechanism in the underlying infrastructure (here
jack) is well defined.
