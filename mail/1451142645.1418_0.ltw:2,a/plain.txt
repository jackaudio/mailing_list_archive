Hmm...  I didn't get that email for some reason.  But yes - as a feature 
update, that sounds promising.  I'm just pointing out that (a) the 
averaging mechanism / hybrid approach is NOT the underlying cause of the 
problem you described - and (b) in Mixbus and Ardour, we can already 
make a solution which wouldn't need us to tinker with Jack.  i.e. the 
following strategy instead of our current one:-

       if ( the_client->got_notified_about_an_xrun() ) {
             //  We know that an xrun occurred since we last checked
             //  the CPU load - so do something to accommodate that.

             //  and then reset the notification flag
             reset_the_xrun_notification_flag ();
       } else {
             //  No xrun was encountered - so we can update normally...
             update_cpu_load ();
       }

That would be very simple to implement and I honestly think we should 
try that first, before tinkering too much with Jack.
