&gt;&gt; My criticism is that jack's currently algorithm does not satisfy the

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How can we justify buffer over/under-runs if there is time left to
&gt;&gt; process the buffer?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Huh? You've already pointed out that any value higher than 95% gets
&gt; reported verbatim (i.e. without getting factored into any averaging). So
&gt; why will 100% not get reported correctly?

Where did I say that?

This is not true. There is always a low-pass filter after the cut and
averaging. Please read my email again and maybe also the code that've
linked in the original email.

&gt; The problem here is that Ardour's DSP printout is NOT intended to
&gt; highlight xruns (not in any sense). It's simply a display (in green)
&gt; which turns to red when the value gets worryingly high.

No, The problem at hand is that *JACK* reports some mostly useless value.

If you want a more abstract description: Two correlated variables are
used to create a single read-out.

The discussion is about jack's mechanism - not the policy applied by
application display.

I was under the impression that jack only provides mechanisms. The
current implementation of the load calculation in libjack however does
make assumptions and does not provide raw data (which an application can
then later use to whatever ends..)

&gt; BUT... it only gets updated once every second. And since the display
&gt; isn't (currently) affected in any way by xruns, if an xrun happens to
&gt; occur in between 2 updates it can go unreported (as far as that DSP
&gt; reading is concerned). Removing Jack's averaging won't fix that problem.
&gt;
&gt; HOWEVER... Ardour already has a mechanism for registering xruns. So
&gt; if we want xruns to get reflected somehow in that DSP printout, we can
&gt; already achieve that within Ardour. It's not necessary to modify Jack.

No we cannot. jack currently does not provide data to allow that. it
reports some tainted average value.

I still have not heard a good justification for libjack doing that, nor
an explanation how to interpret that value and how one can use it.

Why should jack report a percentage if we need to resort to hand-wavey
explanations: "yeah the average is low, but you still get occasional
x-runs..."?

if there's an average we should provide a variance or stddev with the
average.

2c,
robin
