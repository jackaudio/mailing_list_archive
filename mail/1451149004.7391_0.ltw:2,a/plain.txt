On both Windows and OSX, it will use CLOCK_MONOTONIC if it is available.
If not, it will use mach_absolute_time() on OSX, and
QueryPerformanceFrequency()
on Windows. If neither of these are available, it will use tsc.

(https://github.com/kmatheussen/radium/blob/master/audio/monotonic_timer.c,

)


OSX/mach is trivial, but Windows is probably the reason why jack2

(using Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10).
