&gt;&gt;&gt; Huh? You've already pointed out that any value higher than 95% gets
&gt;&gt;&gt; reported verbatim (i.e. without getting factored into any averaging). So
&gt;&gt;&gt; why will 100% not get reported correctly?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Where did I say that?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; A few days ago you said that xruns are caused by "short spikes" but
&gt; that a short spike will only show up in the DSP reading if 3
&gt; conditions are met (one of which was that it would need to be &gt;
&gt; 95%).

right, they're reported once in a blue moon :)

&gt; What I'm saying is that the DSP reading (currently) isn't intended to
&gt; display xruns.  It's only intended to give a general picture of CPU
&gt; load.  If we want it to react to xruns (e.g. to turn red when an xrun
&gt; occurs) we can achieve that very easily from within Ardour.

Yes, this is however not about Ardour. I don't know why you keep
bringing this up. There are a lot more jack-clients and control
applications out there.

All the other arguments I brought forward still stand.

&gt; Modifying Jack (at least in the short term) shouldn't be necessary.

I'm not going to rush this. It's been nagging me for a few years already.

Since libjack aims to be API and ABI compatible, deprecating a call and
adding a new one must be done with great care.

If jack were to provide  min, max, average and stddev a client
application can do the appropriate thing..

Other considerations: should this become a callback API (don't miss a
value) like outlined by Florian earlier in this thread.  But I think
it's still too early to go into details like this until there is some
consensus what jackd should and should not do.
