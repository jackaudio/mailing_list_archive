right, they're reported once in a blue moon :)

Yes, this is however not about Ardour. I don't know why you keep
bringing this up. There are a lot more jack-clients and control
applications out there.

All the other arguments I brought forward still stand.

I'm not going to rush this. It's been nagging me for a few years already.

Since libjack aims to be API and ABI compatible, deprecating a call and
adding a new one must be done with great care.

If jack were to provide  min, max, average and stddev a client
application can do the appropriate thing..

Other considerations: should this become a callback API (don't miss a
value) like outlined by Florian earlier in this thread.  But I think
it's still too early to go into details like this until there is some
consensus what jackd should and should not do.
