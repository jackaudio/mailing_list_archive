IME the dsp load is a relatively useless measure as it's not really
related to the max value (which is where an xrun occurs)..  You could
very well have a system with a very low dsp load xrunning all the
time...

Maybe a nice idea would be similar to a mixer meter showing rms and
peak values, like that everyone could have their cake and eat it too ;)

Apart from that there is the xrun callback that indicates that an xrun
did indeed occur.  If we only had Jack2 to worry about, I'd suggest
leveraging jack2's excellent profiling code, which can give a very good
analysis of how the system performs.

Here is a link to an old paper from Letz, Fober, and Orlarey that shows
the wealth of information that could be gleaned about the graph and
it's timing in a JACK2 system.
