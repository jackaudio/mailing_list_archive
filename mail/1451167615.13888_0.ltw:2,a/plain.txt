Sorry, for this purpose, jack_get_time() is used, not that other function.
That other function is only used when it's important that get_time_of_day
is not used, and when it's okay if tsc is used directly.

I also see that QueryPerformanceCounter is used for jack_get_time().

I thought QueryPerformanceCounter should do the right thing though, but it
seems a bit complicated:
