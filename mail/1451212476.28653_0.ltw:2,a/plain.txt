No, not quite...  you can have a system "displaying" a very low DSP load even though it's xrunning all the time.  But that problem is NOT caused by Jack's CPU load calculation.  Nor is it caused by the averaging strategy.

The averaging strategy was added to JackEngineControl::CalcCPULoad() to address a very specific problem - which it does address, very successfully.  Furthermore (read this bit carefully) it does NOT cause JackEngineControl::CalcCPULoad() to return a low reading when an xrun occurs.  If a client app is giving that impression, the problem lies within the client app.  And that's where it should be getting fixed.

To prove this point (assuming Ben Loftis agrees) I'd be quite happy to add such a fix to Mixbus.  And if Mixbus still displays low readings when an xrun occurs, maybe then we should consider modifying Jack.
