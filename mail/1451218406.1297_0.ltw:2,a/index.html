&gt;&gt;&gt; IME the dsp load is a relatively useless measure as it's not really
&gt;&gt;&gt; related to the max value (which is where an xrun occurs)..  You could
&gt;&gt;&gt; very well have a system with a very low dsp load xrunning all the
&gt;&gt;&gt; time...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; exactly.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; No, not quite... you can have a system "displaying" a very low DSP
&gt; load even though it's xrunning all the time. 

How can one have buffer under/over-runs if there is sufficient time left
to process the buffers?



&gt; The averaging strategy was added to JackEngineControl::CalcCPULoad() 
&gt; to address a very specific problem - which it does address, very 
&gt; successfully. 

What is that? low readout for marketing? :-)

Some facts would be nice and an explanation of thoughts and that lead to
the current implementation. Why keep 32 cycles history? Why not a
rolling-average? Why add a first order low-pass filter after averaging
with a fixed time-constant of 0.5 ? Why 0.5 ?


&gt; Furthermore (read this bit carefully) it does NOT 
&gt; cause JackEngineControl::CalcCPULoad() to return a low reading when 
&gt; an xrun occurs.  If a client app is giving that impression, the 
&gt; problem lies within the client app.  And that's where it should be 
&gt; getting fixed. To prove this point (assuming Ben Loftis agrees) I'd
&gt; be quite happy to
&gt; add such a fix to Mixbus. And if Mixbus still displays low readings when
&gt; an xrun occurs, maybe then we should consider modifying Jack.
&gt; 

Why do you keep bringing up Mixbus all the time? This is about JACK or
more specifically libjack.

Control Applications (like qjackctl, Ardour, Cadence, Mixbus, ...) and
other clients which display the load are all users of the jack-api and
currently limited to a single convoluted value, for which I have not
heard a good argument for.

Would you mind commenting on or answering the questions from other emails?

eg.  What is lost - in your case for Mixbus - if jack were to report
both average and max?

best,
robin
