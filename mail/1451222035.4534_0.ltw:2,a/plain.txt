This can happen (or rather, appear to happen) if the application isn't updating the buffer status frequently enough.  For example in one of your early emails you stated:- "At 1024fpp / 48KHz, 32 cycles corresponds to ~680msec. Most control applications only update the value every second or so."

In which case there are bound to be occasions when Jack flags up a high DSP reading which the client app misses.  However as I keep saying, this is NOT being caused by the averaging mechanism.

I can't answer those questions.  The history buffer and LPF already existed.

If you're referring to Nedko's suggestion I've already stated that I think it would be a useful improvement.  But in the meantime, if users are hearing xruns (while they're seeing DSP figures around 40%) I'm simply pointing out that this is NOT due to the averaging mechanism.  And in any case, if you're referring to Mixbus3 users, those complaints weren't even about the Jack backend.!

Mixbus2 (which uses the Jack backend exclusively) has been around for at least 4 years.  Yet I can't remember a single user complaining about this.
