&gt;&gt; How can one have buffer under/over-runs if there is sufficient time left

&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This can happen (or rather, appear to happen) if the application

Ok, so you were still thinking about the *current* reporting mechanism.

Do you agree that this current behavior is not ideal?

&gt; However as I keep saying, this is NOT being caused by the averaging
mechanism.

Right, it's caused by the overall semantics of that API, which is why
I'm saying that the API is not good.

&gt;&gt; Some facts would be nice and an explanation of thoughts and that lead to
&gt;&gt; the current implementation. Why keep 32 cycles history? Why not a
&gt;&gt; rolling-average? Why add a first order low-pass filter after averaging
&gt;&gt; with a fixed time-constant of 0.5 ? Why 0.5 ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I can't answer those questions.  The history buffer and LPF already existed.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Would you mind commenting on or answering the questions from other emails?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; eg.  What is lost - in your case for Mixbus - if jack were to report
&gt;&gt; both average and max?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; If you're referring to Nedko's suggestion I've already stated that I
think it would be a useful improvement.

good. I must have missed that.

&gt; But in the meantime, if users
&gt; are hearing xruns (while they're seeing DSP figures around 40%) I'm
&gt; simply pointing out that this is NOT due to the averaging mechanism. And
&gt; in any case, if you're referring to Mixbus3 users, those complaints
&gt; weren't even about the Jack backend.!

What use-case do you see in the exposing the average value? How do you
interpret the value? How is a user supposed to interpret it?


As developer I can see some value in it for regression tests (same app,
same machine, same settings) for development, but then again it's the
worst-case that really matters.

As user I'm interested how much more DSP I can safely add, the current
mechanism (average + thread-hold + filter) cannot provide any useful
measure. How do you propose to address this?


&gt; Mixbus2 (which uses the Jack backend exclusively) has been around
&gt; for at least 4 years. Yet I can't remember a single user complaining about
this.

Well, jack has been around much longer. How is that an argument?

best,
robin
