I'd agree with this.  The measures are separate, and it's useful to
know approximately how much headroom you have left until exceeding the
deadline.  Not really related to xruns at all, until you start
exceeding a certain threshold.  Still it would be very useful to have
an indication of the max latency reached so far and not only an
average.  Personally I've been missing this for a long time.  I'd think
the best solution would be the addition of a new call that returns,
max, min and some kind of average of the graph's execution latency.
