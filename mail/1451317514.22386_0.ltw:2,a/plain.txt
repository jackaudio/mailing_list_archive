Maybe I misunderstood, but if the quote above refers to the same operation
taking different amounts of time, couldn't that be explained by
preemption? Sometimes the DSP operation gets suspended for kernel
housekeeping, which results in the end of the DSP operation occurring
later than at other times when it does not get preempted?
