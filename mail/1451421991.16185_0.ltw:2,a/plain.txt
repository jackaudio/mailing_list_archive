You can use the hwlatdetect script included with the rt-tests package
together with a kernel module to get an idea about how bad SMM/SMI
affects your system (provided that it has a well working TSC
implementation).

My i7 desktop has a kernel scheduling latency well under 100us, while
my laptop seems to come in at 120us or so (both -rt patched).
