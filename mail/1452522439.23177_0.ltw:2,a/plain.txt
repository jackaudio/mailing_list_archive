Subject:     [Jack-Devel] dumping MIDI events to a logfile

Hi,

I am trying to dump MIDI events coming from an MIDI2USB Roland
converter (UM-ONE) that is connected to a MIDI keyboard:

http://www.zoobab.com/rockband-wireless-keyboard
https://pastee.org/9xu95
https://pastee.org/qh34g
https://pastee.org/xdwk3

I managed to see the events of the keyboard on Rosegarden, but trying
to dump the events on a logfile with jack_midi_dump seems to be much
more complicated.

I have disabled pulseaudio, added 3 limits in
/etc/security/limits.conf so that jackd can run with priority and al:

@audio          -       memlock         unlimited
@audio          -       nice            -10
@audio          -       rtprio          99

I saw that when I was launching rosegarden, it spawns an instance of
jackd with apparently the right parameters, but if I try to launch
that without rosegarden, it does not work neither.

Any idea?

Best,

PS: I am on IRC as well
