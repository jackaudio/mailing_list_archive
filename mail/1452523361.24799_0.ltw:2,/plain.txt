Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] dumping MIDI events to a logfile

You're trying to run JACK on your MIDI interface.

It doesn't work that way. JACK needs to work with an audio interface but
will then *also* expose MIDI devices as JACK ports (if told to do so, which
you're not doing).

Try this:

   jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:MID -X seq

(the name of your actual audio interface ("MID") is unfortunately somewhat
confusing in this context, given that it isn't a MIDI device and hw:UMONE
is :)
