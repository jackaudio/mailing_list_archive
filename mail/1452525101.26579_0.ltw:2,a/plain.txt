I also tried to hook an FTDI in 5V on the MIDI out connector in
31250bps, I could only see the FE or FC (depending if I would add a
resistor) MIDI messages, and the keyboard would behave differently as
plugged in with the USB:

"In July 2005, after several failed attempts to legalise software
patents in Europe, the patent establishment changed its strategy.
Instead of explicitly seeking to sanction the patentability of
software, they are now seeking to create a central European patent
court, which would establish and enforce patentability rules in their
favor, without any possibility of correction by competing courts or
democratically elected legislators."
