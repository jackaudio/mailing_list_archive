If you just want to sniff the raw MIDI transferred via USB, why not simply use amidi [1]?
There's no need to fiddle with/route via JACK here, imho.

Get the alsa MIDI hardware name for 'UMONE'
	export HW=$(amidi -l | grep UMONE | head -n 1 | gawk '{print $2}')

Dump to console:
	amidi -p ${HW} -d

Dump to file:
	amidi -p ${HW} -r my_dump.rawmidi

If you want to sniff USB MIDI in terms of the raw USB packets,
I'd recommend wireshark [2]. You'll need support for usbmon [3] in the kernel and
the module being loaded (sudo modprobe usbmon).
