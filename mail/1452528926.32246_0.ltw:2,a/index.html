&gt;&gt;&gt; You have to connect jack_midi_dump to the relevant MIDI port(s). You can

&gt;&gt;&gt; You could use jack_connect. There are other ways too.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; You could also use gmidimon :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also tried to hook an FTDI in 5V on the MIDI out connector in
&gt;&gt; 31250bps, I could only see the FE or FC (depending if I would add a
&gt;&gt; resistor) MIDI messages, and the keyboard would behave differently as
&gt;&gt; plugged in with the USB:

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I thought sniffing midi was easier...
&gt;
&gt; If you just want to sniff the raw MIDI transferred via USB, why not simply use amidi [1]?
&gt; There's no need to fiddle with/route via JACK here, imho.
&gt;
&gt; Get the alsa MIDI hardware name for 'UMONE'
&gt;         export HW=$(amidi -l | grep UMONE | head -n 1 | gawk '{print $2}')
&gt;
&gt; Dump to console:
&gt;         amidi -p ${HW} -d
&gt;
&gt; Dump to file:
&gt;         amidi -p ${HW} -r my_dump.rawmidi

Thanks, it worked!

Sorry never played with MIDI before. I am still interested to dump the
MIDI from the serial wire, as the original intent was to build an
ESP8266 serial2wifi module (straight from the MIDI out connector, no
Roland USB converter), and to encapsulate the MIDI messages over some
TCP transport.

If anybody has any idea on which circuit to do (I tried with an
octocopler, but it seems I did not pick the right one)...
