Thanks, it worked!

Sorry never played with MIDI before. I am still interested to dump the
MIDI from the serial wire, as the original intent was to build an
ESP8266 serial2wifi module (straight from the MIDI out connector, no
Roland USB converter), and to encapsulate the MIDI messages over some
TCP transport.

If anybody has any idea on which circuit to do (I tried with an
octocopler, but it seems I did not pick the right one)...
