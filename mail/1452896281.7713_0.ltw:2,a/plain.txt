Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Add JackOSX projects to jack organisation

Hi all,

I noticed that the JackOSX projects were not in the organisation for JACK on Github.
It would be very useful if they were, they could receive more attention, and maybe some people could work on them.
I, for one, would like to help with development, and help update the apps in the project to the latest APIs so that it can move forward with the time. Although I'm not even sure where the latest version is.
The source code is currently very difficult to access in Sourceforge's CVS repo [1] which hasn't been touched in a very long time, although later binaries have been released [2].
It would be a waste to see such a great project be left behind.

Thanks,

Josh
