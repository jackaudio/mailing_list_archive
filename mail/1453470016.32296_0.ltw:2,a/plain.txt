Subject:     [Jack-Devel] What about NetJack on OSX ?

Hello Mr. Davis,
I am having exactly the same problem as vic hug,
 so as you said I downloaded the 0.90 version from 
http://jackosx.com/ but I found out that
 NetJack wasn't installed on that version until it would be 
fixed.
Or the only reason why I want to use JACK IS for NetJack !
Do you know, or do you have an approximate idea about when
 NetJack will be available for OS X 
without having to build JACK from source ?
Thank you very much.
