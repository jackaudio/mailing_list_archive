Great!
Does this include the latest patch from Fons too?

Can't say I'm surprised.
JACK development has been slowly decreasing in activity.
We have working meta-data in jack1 now at least, thanks for that!

I'd be happy to take care of the maintenance of the code (making sure it 
works on new distros, dealing with pull requests, etc).
But only if someone else is willing to handle the non-coding parts, like 
the website.

I think the ideal case would be to combine both pulseaudio and jack in a 
single API that allows both realtime/producer-oriented plus 
consumer-oriented applications.
Having pulseaudio give up the soundcard for JACK is nice and all, but 
users get very confused why their sound mixer suddently stops working...



Anyway, I got a question for you Paul.
What do you think about the jack1 dbus patch?
Having that in would allow to have the same dbus tricks jack2 uses for 
pulseaudio.
I know you don't truly agree on how it was done, but since you're 
stepping down I know there's very little chance the "proper" way will 
get done.


And Nedko, if you're reading this, are you willing to finish the jack1 
dbus integration if Paul agrees with its inclusion?
