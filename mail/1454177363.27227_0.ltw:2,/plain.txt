It will, yes.

The website doesn't change much. The "Applications" page already has its
own maintainer (though it also doesn't change much). I think you already
have push access on github, so ... great.

my objection was that i think the dbus integration should be in a separate
process that uses the server control API to start/stop a JACK server.

at this point, i don't think that my objection is worth anything at all,
even though i still believe that my conception (the one that came out of
the 2007 "Berlin summit") is "more correct".

the reality is that nobody ever developed any other control protocols for
JACK. there was talk of an OSC control app, but this never materialized.
from a pragmatic perspective, dbus is the only control protocol that has
ever emerged, and after many (many!) years in that condition, it makes
sense to integrate that into the server itself.
