&gt;           as the years have gone on, although I am still delighted by
&gt;         the technical quality and
&gt;             the conception of JACK, I no longer think that it is a
&gt;         particularly good idea for most users. There
&gt;             are times when it is useful
&gt;
&gt;         Could you elaborate on this?  Curious to know more.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; JACK was developed in part because of the absence of a viable plugin API
&gt; on Linux. It allowed people to "glue together" whole applications rather
&gt; than load plugins into a host. This is pretty cool, no question. But the
&gt; session management aspects of it are not that cool, and despite both the
&gt; JACK session API and the Non session manager and other things that
&gt; falktx (Filipe) have done, the situation for users really hasn't ever
&gt; gotten to the point where reloading a "JACK session" comprised of many
&gt; individual applications is as easy as it ought to be.

Just a very quick comment on this:

JACK makes Linux (and OS X) the best platform for highly innovative 
immersive audio stuff and massive multichannel systems, by a huge 
margin. It also makes it great for prototyping.
It's true that the necessity of JACK for the "simple project studio" has 
diminished somewhat, but at the same time, linux audio has outgrown this 
niche.

I routinely use jack-based systems for 3d audio rendering that have more 
than 1k jack ports in use. True, it's somewhat messy, but the 
corresponding amp racks, MADI and Dante links and shitloads of 
loudspeakers are not exactly turn-key either.

I welcome the fact that a beginning ardour user does not have to master 
jack anymore, in the same way that my sound engineering apprentice does 
not have to master the rear side of the ampracks in order to get some 
intermission music into the theatre. But for me anything that makes 
linux audio interesting requires jack.

That said, your motives in stepping down are perfectly understandable. 
But I don't agree with your assessment of JACK's importance.
