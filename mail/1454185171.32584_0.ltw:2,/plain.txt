Just a very quick comment on this:

JACK makes Linux (and OS X) the best platform for highly innovative 
immersive audio stuff and massive multichannel systems, by a huge 
margin. It also makes it great for prototyping.
It's true that the necessity of JACK for the "simple project studio" has 
diminished somewhat, but at the same time, linux audio has outgrown this 
niche.

I routinely use jack-based systems for 3d audio rendering that have more 
than 1k jack ports in use. True, it's somewhat messy, but the 
corresponding amp racks, MADI and Dante links and shitloads of 
loudspeakers are not exactly turn-key either.

I welcome the fact that a beginning ardour user does not have to master 
jack anymore, in the same way that my sound engineering apprentice does 
not have to master the rear side of the ampracks in order to get some 
intermission music into the theatre. But for me anything that makes 
linux audio interesting requires jack.

That said, your motives in stepping down are perfectly understandable. 
But I don't agree with your assessment of JACK's importance.
