This is true. I did not realize it was just the Jack1 version being discussed when I wrote my last message; all I saw was Jack going dead.

As for applications that don't offer device options, can you show me any program from Apple that does? Quicktime Player, Mail's sounds, Safari playing HTML5, at least Terminal's beeps use the error device instead of the normal output device, etc. -- all use the default audio output. So do many if not most third-party apps. Firefox, Flash player, heck Dish Anywhere's custom plugin, etc. Etc.

It's easier to list what does support other audio devices. Vlc, MPlayer, OBS, the screen recorder I use, Teamspeak, ... umm ... what else?
