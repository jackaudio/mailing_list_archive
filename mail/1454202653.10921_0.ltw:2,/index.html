Hi,
i find it a bit sad that anyone seems to say things like "JACK is dead"
easily--- There is no alternative to it IMHO
Please, JACK lovers, speak out!

&gt;&gt; The website doesn't change much. The "Applications" page already has
&gt;&gt; its own maintainer (though it also doesn't change much). I think you
&gt;&gt; already have push access on github, so ... great.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The lack of change and improvement on the website...
&gt; Well, I'll take the blame on me for that.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In the past, I had a vision but my motivation to support the website
&gt; kind of drowned due to various reasons. Some are similar observations like
&gt; Paul's, some are related to the complicated situation JACK (as an
&gt; API AND it's implementations) is in and there is also that damn thing
&gt; called "life" that keeps happening to me, very distracting.
&gt;
&gt; Basically, I realised, that JACK is dead, maybe not yet the software,
&gt; but as a project and that is frustrating. The more I research about JACK
&gt; the more tired and sad I get, especially the inevitable aging of the
&gt; software and so on... the usual stuff that software developers have to
&gt; deal with. (see attachment for a little smile)
&gt;
&gt; That may sound very negative (because I am currently very negative about
&gt; that) and I am not willing to contribute to JACK (1/2/API tools/homepage
&gt; and in general) anymore unless someone can provide a positive and
&gt; realistic vision for the project that is beyond milking the dead cow for
&gt; another 4 or 5 years.
&gt;
&gt; I can check and merge pull requests, communicate and provide help
&gt; regarding the homepage if someone want's to take over but I won't put
&gt; significant effort in a website of which I have the feeling nobody cares
&gt; about and represents a dead project.
&gt;
&gt; Well, enough rant and with the disclaimer that this is just from a
&gt; personal and very limited perspective on things.
