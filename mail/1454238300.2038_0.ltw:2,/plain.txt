One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet is the educational aspect of JACK;
it is probably the simplest way to do audio I/O using C/C++. And the
community
around it are a great bunch.

I like JACK for its routing and pro-audio use-cases, but its the fact that
it
taught me to program audio applications due to it that I like most of all :)
