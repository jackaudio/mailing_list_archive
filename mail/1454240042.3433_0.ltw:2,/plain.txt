Would it be possible to provide old documentation or concept material
about JACK? I have been browsing through some old presentations from
previous LACs and sometimes I find small pieces in the net about JACK
but maybe there is more material that explains the concepts behind JACK?
It does not have to be nicely formatted and fleshed out, but anything
that helps to learn a bit about JACK would be helpful.
