&gt; &gt; &gt; It has a wonderful API, but it shouldn't be a struggle for a program to
&gt; &gt; &gt; create a jack client
&gt; &gt; &gt; if a jack server isn't running. (there were a lot of talk about this
&gt; &gt; &gt; around 10 years ago,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but the end result never became as good as it should I think).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i am not sure what the problem is here. if the client doesn't specify
&gt; &gt; anything, then the server will start automatically with the same
&gt; parameters
&gt; &gt; as it did last time. this has worked for years. no?
&gt;
&gt; Well, it worked for many, but it also had confusing aspects for many
&gt; users, on
&gt; Linux at least.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, IMO many proposed useful features never made into JACK due to
&gt; generalization concerns. JACK's general design concept was always "it's
&gt; just a
&gt; server with a set of buffers being passed around, JACK does not know or
&gt; care
&gt; what the content of the buffers is". And this fundamental design barrier
&gt; was
&gt; defended over years, which caused it to age.
&gt;

i don't think that this isn't accurate.

(1) JACK *has* to know what the data is because it has to (potentially) mix
it. this has always been true.
(2) adding new data types to JACK is a relatively simple matter from the
perspective of jackd and libjack. It isn't simple for applications/clients,
which have to deal with the possibility of ports of "odd" types.



&gt;
&gt; Generalization of software is good for developers, but real value for
&gt; users is
&gt; added by adding customizations for the main purpose it is used for. And the
&gt; main purpose of JACK is distributing audio signals with audio applications
&gt; and
&gt; audio devices, not distributing RSS feeds between coffee machines.
&gt; Accordingly
&gt; important features for that purpose, like the ability to control the gain
&gt; factor of audio connections should IMO be incorporated directly into JACK.
&gt;

this is VASTLY less important than global latency management. almost every
client that writes data to a JACK port has a gain control somewhere in the
path that leads to the port, and manages gain for its own reasons. but very
few clients (if any) can truly manage latency issues, and i have reversed
my original position on this (which used to be that clients should do it).


&gt;
&gt; Another internal deficit was the policy how to deal with laggy clients.
&gt; Which
&gt; is quite important for consumer use cases. Instead of simply kicking out a
&gt; laggy client from the signal graph it would be better to handle it like
&gt; CoreAudio does: that is automatically increasing the latency instead.
&gt;

given that jack2 (the most widely used implementation) still doesn't have
automatic/builtin MIDI bridging, as well as no easy way to use multiple
devices, i think that's a much less important issue (particularly since
jack2 doesn't kick clients out under almost any circumstances at all.
