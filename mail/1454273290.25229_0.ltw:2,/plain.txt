Well, I've never used it. It doesn't feel safe. There is no obvious place to
check that it does what it's supposed to.

If only one program produces sound, why would you also want to start a
server?

1. If it is the last client which is about to close, then the server closes
as well.
2. If you close the client running the server while other clients are
running as well,
then the server must be transferred to another client first, in a
glitch-free and
spike-free manner, of course. This functionality would both feel natural
(the user doesn't have to think about the server concept at all), plus that
it
would provide an enormous number of fun and interesting programming
challenges
for the implementors of that functionality.

Oh right, guess I knew that once though.

But my point is that you don't need the jackd program. Every client is also
a potential
server (although the user doesn't know this), and since libjack provides
functionalities for
configuring jack the same way for all clients, jackd is not needed. This
way we can also
create formally specified error messages for the clients. Currently, if
something goes
wrong, you have to dig around in the "messages" window in qjackctl, which
may contain
some information that could help you make things work. It's really bad
actually.
