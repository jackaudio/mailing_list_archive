&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think Jack is the wrong solution for a DAW either. But Jack
&gt;&gt;&gt; never got finished.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It has a wonderful API, but it shouldn't be a struggle for a program to
&gt;&gt;&gt; create a jack client
&gt;&gt;&gt; if a jack server isn't running. (there were a lot of talk about this
&gt;&gt;&gt; around 10 years ago,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but the end result never became as good as it should I think).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; i am not sure what the problem is here. if the client doesn't specify
&gt;&gt; anything, then the server will start automatically with the same parameters
&gt;&gt; as it did last time. this has worked for years. no?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, I've never used it. It doesn't feel safe. There is no obvious place
&gt; to
&gt; check that it does what it's supposed to.
&gt;

You're sure of that? Every one of your JACK clients explicitly avoids
auto-start?

The mechanism for this is extremely simple and robust. The contents of the
file ~/.jackdrc are executed. You can check the result with ps aux or a
graphical equivalent.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the first program trying to create a client also should start
&gt;&gt;&gt; the server. Not
&gt;&gt;&gt; just fork off a process, but actually run the server.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And if another program wants to create a jack client, it connects to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; first client process,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which is the one running the server.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; this seems a bit odd to me. if the first client is really just a client,
&gt;&gt; why would it become the server?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If only one program produces sound, why would you also want to start a
&gt; server?
&gt;

i can think of lots of reasons. but i don't think it matters.


&gt;
&gt; , plus that it
&gt; would provide an enormous number of fun and interesting programming
&gt; challenges
&gt; for the implementors of that functionality.
&gt;

and no effective difference for users over and above the current auto-start
scenario.

you also missed out how EVERY single possible JACK client now has to have
some way to bring up a server control dialog, that will work no matter what
GUI toolkit the client was written with (or no GUI toolkit).

is this supposed to be a serious suggestion?


&gt;
&gt; But my point is that you don't need the jackd program. Every client is
&gt; also a potential
&gt; server (although the user doesn't know this), and since libjack provides
&gt; functionalities for
&gt; configuring jack the same way for all clients, jackd is not needed. This
&gt; way we can also
&gt; create formally specified error messages for the clients. Currently, if
&gt; something goes
&gt; wrong, you have to dig around in the "messages" window in qjackctl, which
&gt; may contain
&gt; some information that could help you make things work. It's really bad
&gt; actually.
&gt;

a pathway for errors to propagate from server to clients was something
discussed in berlin in 2007.
