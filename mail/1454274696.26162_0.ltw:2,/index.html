&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think Jack is the wrong solution for a DAW either. But Jack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never got finished.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It has a wonderful API, but it shouldn't be a struggle for a program to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; create a jack client
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if a jack server isn't running. (there were a lot of talk about this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; around 10 years ago,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the end result never became as good as it should I think).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; i am not sure what the problem is here. if the client doesn't specify
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything, then the server will start automatically with the same parameters
&gt;&gt;&gt; as it did last time. this has worked for years. no?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, I've never used it. It doesn't feel safe. There is no obvious place
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; check that it does what it's supposed to.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You're sure of that? Every one of your JACK clients explicitly avoids
&gt; auto-start?
&gt;
&gt;
I think so too, but I meant to say that, as a user, I always start jackd
first since I don't want
to risk a client to start jackd in a way I don't feel sure about.




&gt; The mechanism for this is extremely simple and robust. The contents of the
&gt; file ~/.jackdrc are executed. You can check the result with ps aux or a
&gt; graphical equivalent.
&gt;


It would be better if this information was available in a function in
libjack so that
clients can show what's happening.



&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; , plus that it
&gt;&gt; would provide an enormous number of fun and interesting programming
&gt;&gt; challenges
&gt;&gt; for the implementors of that functionality.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; and no effective difference for users over and above the current
&gt; auto-start scenario.
&gt;
&gt; you also missed out how EVERY single possible JACK client now has to have
&gt; some way to bring up a server control dialog, that will work no matter what
&gt; GUI toolkit the client was written with (or no GUI toolkit).
&gt;
&gt; is this supposed to be a serious suggestion?
&gt;

Yes. First you imagine what would be perfect. Later we can worry about
reality.
