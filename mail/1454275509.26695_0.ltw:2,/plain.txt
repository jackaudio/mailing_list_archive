Another serious problem: Lets say I have a program made by someone that never knew anything about Jack, and is outputting audio to whatever the default system device is. I want that to output to the Jack system. For that to happen, something other than a program that I cannot alter must be able to start up and serve the jack system.

Hence, a server.
