&gt; I meant server options. Driver name, realtime on/off, driver options,
&gt; timeout, etc.
&gt;

why does a client want these? it would not contain code to start JACK that
required any of this .... unless you're suggesting a different GUI to
configure the server in every client, which you're not ...


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't anything perfect about jack_lsp popping up a GUI dialog to
&gt;&gt; configure a server. I don't see anything good about a careful constructed
&gt;&gt; GUI application having to deal with the reality of a new dialog being
&gt;&gt; created. this isn't even close to perfect.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; But it's better than having different GUIs in every client for configuring
&gt; jack.
&gt;

I am fairly confident that what is better for most users is having a well
known point of control (e.g. cadence, qjackctl) to start and control JACK,
as well as the capability to start the server from scripts etc.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; what problem are you actually concerned with fixing? what users does it
&gt;&gt; affect? when?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think I have listed the problems. The far worst problem is that there
&gt; is no proper error response when a driver doesn't start. Especially on
&gt; Windows,
&gt; where qjackctl is quite buggy and portaudio often refuses to start.
&gt;

Qjackctl arranges to catch all output from the server, which is by far the
simplest way to present information to the user, especially in a context
where the reasons for failure can be incredibly complex. It might not work
as well on Windows as it does on *nix platforms, but I hardly think that
this would justify some new mechanism to pass failure information between
processes.
