why does a client want these? it would not contain code to start JACK that
required any of this .... unless you're suggesting a different GUI to
configure the server in every client, which you're not ...

I am fairly confident that what is better for most users is having a well
known point of control (e.g. cadence, qjackctl) to start and control JACK,
as well as the capability to start the server from scripts etc.

Qjackctl arranges to catch all output from the server, which is by far the
simplest way to present information to the user, especially in a context
where the reasons for failure can be incredibly complex. It might not work
as well on Windows as it does on *nix platforms, but I hardly think that
this would justify some new mechanism to pass failure information between
processes.
