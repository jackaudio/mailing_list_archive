i haven't seen a single bug report regarding such behaviour. what isn't
reported can't get fixed. the only times i have to SIGKILL jackd is when
i'm doing code development and i do something deeply screwy.

there will ALWAYS be a server in a system like JACK. if there is code that
ends up requiring SIGKILL, then the same code can end up executing inside
whatever process is running that code.
