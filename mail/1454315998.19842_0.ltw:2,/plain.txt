You want to see which options jack has been started with. You want this
information
visible in an obvious way. It is both undocumented and flaky to have to
"run ps -Af|grep jackd" or something like that to get this information.

And that's what I'm suggesting. One well known point of control, provided
by libjack, which every
client can use, if they want.



 as well as the capability to start the server from scripts etc.

Sure, there's nothing wrong creating a dummy-client that only runs the
server, if you need that.

This is so flaky and uncertain. Layers upon layers of software, which all
may fail.
The end result is that there is a higher chance for the user to not get the
information
he needs, plus the added complexity and frustration. libjack should take
care of all this.
