It's an interesting line of thought.

What happens if the original app that was used to start the jack process
is taken out either by force or error?

The rest of the group needs to have a mechanism for keeping running.

A server solves this problem by keeping jack as a seperate process that is
not dependant on any other process to keep it alive.

Can you expand on how you would solve this with library instead of a server?
