Yes, that's an interesting programming challenge. It's probably very hard
to make this work decently, but the thing is that if you want to run several
clients at the same time, you will still have the option of starting a
"main client"
first, same way as you run jackd now. What I was replying to in this thread,
was if you want run a DAW, you very often only want to run one client, and
then you don't need to start jackd and qjackctl.
