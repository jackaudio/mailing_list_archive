&gt; &gt;What I was replying to in this thread, was if you want run a DAW, you
&gt; &gt;very often only want to run one client, and then you don't need to
&gt; &gt;start jackd and qjackctl.
&gt;
&gt; Assumed the DAW requires jackd, as e.g. Qtractor does, then there's the
&gt; need to run jackd. However, it's not important for the user, since
&gt; Qtractor automatically will start jackd, if it isn't already running.
&gt; Indeed, we don't have to launch jackd, but the DAW needs to launch it.
&gt; Following audio related Linux mailing lists I doubt that "very often" is
&gt; correct. My impression is, that more often people use a DAW not only
&gt; with plugins, but with additional software that requires audio and MIDI
&gt; sync.
&gt;


But if the DAW crashes, would it be any point continuing to run the other
clients?
(And by "continue to run" I only mean continue to run the jack callback, the
other clients don't have to crash.)
