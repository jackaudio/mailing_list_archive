&gt; A server solves this problem by keeping jack as a seperate process that is
&gt; not dependant on any other process to keep it alive.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you expand on how you would solve this with library instead of a server?
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; Yes, that's an interesting programming challenge. It's probably very hard
&gt; to make this work decently, but the thing is that if you want to run several
&gt; clients at the same time, you will still have the option of starting a "main client"
&gt; first, same way as you run jackd now. What I was replying to in this thread,
&gt; was if you want run a DAW, you very often only want to run one client, and
&gt; then you don't need to start jackd and qjackctl.
&gt; 


Before this discussion becomes too crazy&#x85; (like :  "let's redesign JACK yet again&#x85; but without anyone to ever implement this new/better/fabulous new stuff&#x85;.)  Kjetil I  would suggest you read this old paper (2009) on JACK2 design, that answers some of your questions : 

http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2009/cdm/Thursday/01_Letz/01.pdf

Then I guess the discussion could move on what can be done on a more general level : how to keep JACK1 code base alive ? should we redirect the few developer resource to at least maintain JACK2 code base on Linux, OSX, Windows?  This kind of questions.
