The end of an era!

A big congratulations to Paul and the Ardour team for getting to the point
where Paul is too busy to work on JACK anymore. That is a great
accomplishment and is due in large part to the original development of
JACK to create a solid foundation for Ardour.

JACK1 is still a very useful part of our toolkit. We routinely use it for
distributed audio processing on a range of machines with many different
versions of Linux. In that environment it seems to be more stable than
JACK2.

It seems that the differences between JACK1 and JACK2 relate to the
intended target use case. JACK2 does a decent job of trying to enable many
consumer friendly tasks and take out some of the pain of doing inter
application audio production. JACK1 handles some heavy lifting scenarios
more effectively than JACK2.

Maybe that is a good direction to continue for the different codebases?

JACK1 - Heavy lift mechanism for high performance Linux platforms
JACK2 - Flexible user friendly solution with cross platform support

I don't see any problem with continuing the split development process in
that regard. Maybe we don't need a single tool to do everything anyway?

I hope that Paul will continue to provide his insight and expertise as
part of the JACK development community.

If he is interested, I nominate Harry Van Haaren as the new official
maintainer for JACK1 codebase. He has proven his skills and commitment and
is a fair and impartial communicator.

Anyone else want to put their hat in?
