Subject:     [Jack-Devel] No DAWism, please.

I love Ardour. It is the heart of many of my important workflows. But 
there are other equally important workflows that don't require Ardour, 
or any other DAW. Jack is not about DAWs only. Jack is about getting 
audio stuff done that is otherwise impossible to get done. Jack is not 
for Aunt Tilly to hear her "you have mail" chime, or for people to watch 
youtube in. Jack is for pros, experimenters, production environments.
Jack is used all over the world to drive systems with more speakers than 
Aunt Tilly has years.

Anything that makes Jack even more useful to DAW users or even Aunt 
Tilly is welcome, as long as it doesn't affect the pro usecases. Tack on 
a session manager, nice, go ahead. Turn Jack into an inflamed appendix 
of the fashionable usecase of the day, not ok.
Anything that will cause any "you have mail" chimes to end up on my PA 
systems without me having asked for it explicitly will get a personal 
visit from me and my 22 wrench for a quick brainstorming session on 
systems design.
