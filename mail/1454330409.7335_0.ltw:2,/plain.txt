i disagree, most emphatically. the client should never be the server. do 
you want to spend ages figuring out whether a jack problem happened with 
an in-process server or external server, each time a user cries their 
eyes out on IRC? do you want to battle all the conceptual 
misunderstandings about how in-process servers are faster, and 
out-of-process servers are more robust, and sound warmer? why? what's so 
bad about a clean conceptual separation?

now that is something we can agree on, but that's *completely* orthogonal.

but the way i do it, i open qjackctl and look at the message window. 
problem solved. and i guess i can explain that to users far more quickly 
than you can implement a new message passing API for jackd.
developer time saved, user understanding improved. two sacred pillars of 
the open source culture.
