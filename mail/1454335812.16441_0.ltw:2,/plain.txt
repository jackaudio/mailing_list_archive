On Linux, JACK1 provides extremely easy ways to use multiple devices at
once, full integration with the ALSA sequencer system for MIDI and the
metadata system to allow for "pretty names" among other things.

JACK2 offers dbus integration which means that it can interact with
pulseaudio to "share" a device.

Filipe (falktx) has already volunteered for the position.
