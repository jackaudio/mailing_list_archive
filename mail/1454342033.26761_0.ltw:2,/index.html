&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; coming from jackd until autumn 2015.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; that has to do with windows and qjackctl, not with jackd.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But it illustrates how flaky the system is when a bug like this can exist
&gt; &gt; for 10 years.
&gt;
&gt; No, a 10 year old bug illustrates nothing but the nature of open
&gt; source. For a bug to be fixed it must (a) be encountered (b) be
&gt; reported and (c) receive developer attention. (a) &amp; (b) is extremely
&gt; hard for qjackctl on win32 because the majority of the userbase is on
&gt; a different platform. Hats off to yourself for stepping up to fill (c)
&gt; and giving win32 some much needed attention, but this doesn't make
&gt; jackd "flaky".
&gt;
&gt;
I understand why things are like they are. I'm not claiming anyone has done
a bad job. Absolutely not. I just point out that things can be better. Had
there been
a libjackserver library, where the server itself had been included,
qjackctl could have linked to that library instead of starting a process
and do very informal and flaky communication between the server
and the GUI.

(Oh, and regarding the qjackctl bug. I didn't only do (c), I also fixed
the bug itself)




&gt; Your proposal doesn't make sense in general. It's narrow minded and
&gt; very focused on the GUI application use-case.


No, it's not. I'm proposing to put the jack server into a library,
preferably
libjack. jackd wouldn't stop to exist because of that.



&gt; Anyway, a separate process makes the whole system *more* robust, not
&gt; more flaky. If the jack server is running in the same address space as
&gt; a client, then an error in that client (segfault/buffer overflow/etc)
&gt; can bring down the entire audio system.
&gt;
&gt; But I'm not proposing to remove jackd. If you want to continue using
jackd, you can.


It sounds like the existing configuration mechanism provided by jackd
&gt; enables you to do what you want already (ie. running ~/.jackdrc). You
&gt; can do literally whatever you want in this script. You don't have to
&gt; run jackd directly, you can write a GUI frontend that lets you
&gt; configure options before launching jackd and make ~/.jackdrc launch
&gt; *that*.


That's all good. But as I've pointed out, there's no proper way to find
out what's really happening. libjack should have a 'char *jack_info()'
function
that clients can display, as a minimum.




&gt;
&gt;
The best part about this is that it just works with no change to
&gt; jackd, no change to libjack, and no change to any clients. This is
&gt; UNIX philosophy. We have simple tools and we glue them together. And
&gt; the result is beautiful.
&gt;
&gt; And I'm proposing to extend that thought further by putting the server part
of jackd into a library.
