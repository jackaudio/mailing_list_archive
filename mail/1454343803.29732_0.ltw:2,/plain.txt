Oh, right. That's what I thought too, but I must have misunderstood what
Paul
meant by "libjackserver isn't what you think it is". Anyway, good to know.
Now we only need to add gui functions to libjackserver (i.e. pull out stuff
from
qjackctl into a new executable which can only be started by libjackserver,
and communicate
with that executable via sockets), move libjackserver into libjack,
and let jack_client_open start jack via libjackserver.
