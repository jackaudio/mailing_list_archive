GUI functions? they'd have to be in a separate process. so you still have
to write a different executable, which means you're basically reinventing
qjackctl but just fork+exec'ing it from a client rather than using jack
auto-start features, plus making the real client wait until the server
appears (which could be seconds, minutes or hours later).
