the outcome would be that if a client starts and no jack server was
started, a gui pops up? that would be nice and i think it could be done
via a hook jack would offer ("pre-autostartup user interaction") that's
separated from the server. the details are not fully clear but the outcome
of a dialogue that asks for device selection and params if server not
started i think is attractive in gui environments.
