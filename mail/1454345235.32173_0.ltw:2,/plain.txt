this already exists. your issue with it is the communication is currently
asymmetric: there is a structured protocol to configure and start the
server, but not in the reverse direction. you want errors and status
returned as well. and you want a structured protocol for this direction,
rather than semi-random line-oriented text.

so how will an abritrary client become "the server" ?

it is just amazing to me, given all the other useful things that JACK could
be made to do, that anyone is talking about the mechanics of starting it.
