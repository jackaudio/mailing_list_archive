Configuring a given JACK server is always a potentially complex operation,
given the number of possible parameters for both the server and the backend.

Any client can start a server with any parameters. But for that to be
useful to the user, it probably has to present the options to the user and
gather their choices; That isn't trivial, which is partly why almost no
clients bother to even try this (Ardour is one of the few non-control
applications that does, and even it imposes drastic limitations on options
the user can select from).
