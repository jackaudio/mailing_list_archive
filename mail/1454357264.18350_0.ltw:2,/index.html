&gt; Had there been a libjackserver library, where the server itself had been

&gt; (Oh, and regarding the qjackctl bug. I didn't only do (c), I also fixed
&gt; the bug itself)
&gt;

let me chime in, probably way out of context, but there it goes...

for qjackctl's sake, fwiw.

1) qjackctl was and still is a gui for jackd as it was back on 2003;
2) its primary developer (me) is stuck to the original jackd code base, 
that means JACK1;
3) as in a bad lava-flow anti-pattern, jackdmp, win32, jackdbus and what 
else, has been glued, as clay thrown to a wall, so to speak, to qjackctl 
code base;
4) the original author (me) can't, won't, never will perhaps, test and 
ensure quality of all and/or any of those sti(n)cky code that has been 
added over a dozen years that have been passed by, any/all but the JACK1 
related code, tbh.
5) all that said meaning that qjackctl is NON SUPPORTED software 
upstream (me) as far as any other platform BUT Linux--and even there, 
JACK2 might suffer more or less from this stance, so sorry.

now please,

don't ever take this lousy piece of junk of software as qjackctl is to 
issue an injunction against JACK (1 or 2), please, please and...

signing off.
