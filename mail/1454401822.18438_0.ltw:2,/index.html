&gt; Maybe it is the difference in the way we are using JACK over here.
&gt; Particularly with netjack but also with a variety of older systems.  In
&gt; some cases we don't have pulseaudio or D-bus running. in total we have
&gt; more consistent results with JACK1 for our use case.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not saying that JACK2 cannot be made to perform as well as JACK1 in
&gt; the same circumstances and it could also be that proper A/B testing
&gt; reveals a user bias instead of real world performance differences.
&gt; 
&gt; However we generally do not have the time or inclination to do such tests
&gt; as it usually takes a considerable amount of effort to get a fully working
&gt; system and trying to replicate the results with JACK2 is not our main
&gt; motivation.
&gt; 
&gt; The point is that JACK1 is still very useful so unless we are going to
&gt; spend a lot of time/effort to track down the differences between JACK1 and
&gt; JACK2 it is useful to keep JACK1 alive for specific use cases.
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming that we have a few people who are willing to keep contributing to
&gt; the JACK1 codebase then it shouldn't be a problem for JACK1 to track JACK2
&gt; or vice versa.
&gt; 
&gt; However if no one wants to continue maintaining JACK1 then we need to
&gt; spend some time to find and isolate any differences in performance between
&gt; the two.

I agree that JACK1 is still very useful. I'm mainly using JACK2 at the moment
because I need to run multiple clients with the load spread over several CPU
cores. I used JACK1 for many years before my present use case, and I'd use it
again on a simpler setup.

As a user it's a bit frustrating that there are other differences between
JACK1 and 2 apart from UP/SMP and dbus capability. There's often some
other trade off to consider when deciding which one to use.
