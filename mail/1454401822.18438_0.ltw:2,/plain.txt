I agree that JACK1 is still very useful. I'm mainly using JACK2 at the moment
because I need to run multiple clients with the load spread over several CPU
cores. I used JACK1 for many years before my present use case, and I'd use it
again on a simpler setup.

As a user it's a bit frustrating that there are other differences between
JACK1 and 2 apart from UP/SMP and dbus capability. There's often some
other trade off to consider when deciding which one to use.
