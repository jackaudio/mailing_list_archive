(maybe this is unrelated but) I compile jack2 from source on Debian Sid. 
A few days ago, I installed the pulseaudio JACK source/sink package from 
Debian, and added these lines to /etc/pulse/default.pa, in the "load 
drivers statically" section:

load-module module-jack-sink
load-module module-jack-source

Now JACK runs whenever the computer is running, and all inputs and 
outputs are mapped magically. This does result in "you've got mail" 
coming out the PA system, so it's not for everyone, but since I've got 
24 ins and outs, I can map things the way I want...

...when did things get this easy? And powerful?

David
