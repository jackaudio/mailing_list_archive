Have been using that trick for a few years now. You can even fix the
system notifications too, if there's a separate sound interface you
want them to come out of, just use pavucontrol and set the output for
system notifications to a device other tha the jack sink. (Honestly, I
always turn them off anyway.) It's really nice to be able to do it,
because you can feed sounds from things within pulseaudio into your
workflow (e.g. youtube into DAW).

Many thanks to Paul and all the others who have worked on Jack (and
Rui for the very useful qjackctl). I think it's currently suffering
from the problem that it does what it's supposed to, which tends to
make projects look like they've stalled.

(If I had one wishlist item, it would be multiple sources, but I
realise there are significant technical challenges there. Having
separate source and output is useful though.)
