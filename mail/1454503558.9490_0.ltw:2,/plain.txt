This has been part of Jack1 on Linux for a couple of years, and part of
Jack2 on other platforms for much longer.

For Jack1, the -A or -I options provide a simple or complex (respectively)
to add arbitrary input or output devices to the server at startup time.

If you're willing to add them later, then on Linux, zita_a2j and zita_j2a
do a fine job.
