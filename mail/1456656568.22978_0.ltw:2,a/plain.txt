fwiw. have built, packaged and run jack-0.125.0rc1:
   http://www.rncbc.org/archive/#jack
also on my OBS home project:
   https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:rncbc/jack

example startup log head:

using qjackctl for that matter where pretty_name metadata  aliases are 
being used all the time btw. also doing all the usual things: 
development, testing, debugging, playing, streaming, browsing, etc. and 
with pulseaudio-sink and -source modules all along... all that on one 
desktop and two laptops, all rigged with latest 4.4 kernels (preempt 
w/threadirqs and preempt_rt_full; rtirq sets the primary snd card to 
rtprio=90 thus the jackd -P86 ... ;))

all to tell that 0.125.0rc1 is doing fine over here without any major 
hiccups, though the usual xruns specially due on video and possibly 
pulseaudio related but sure that was also happening before on jackd-0.124.x

so it seems it's all as solid as ever before.

however i have a complaint :) re. the git repo in particular: since 
0.125.0rc1 announcement the submodules aren't pulling right... evidence 
follows:
