not so fast, sorry. i missed to report one particular issue though:

as a matter of fact, the alsa_midi driver eg. jackd -Xalsa_midi (or 
-Xseq), seems to severely interfere with pulseaudio and/or vice-versa.
  symptoms are that of all jack audio pcm sound getting horribly garbled 
if not silence most of the time and pulseaudio stops to function if at 
all. nb. though good old `a2jmidid -e &` works fine instead.

however, i am not sure this is incidental to 0.125.0rc1, as i believe 
the issue has been seen before and probably is related to some 
pulseaudio recent updates. btw. distro is opensuse tumbleweed which gets 
pervasive system updates, on a weekly basis

again, to be clear, nothing about zombie clients or crashes experienced 
with 0.125.0rc1.
