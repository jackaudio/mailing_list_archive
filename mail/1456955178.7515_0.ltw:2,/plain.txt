I get the crackles *sometimes*. My general setup is Clementine playing
audio, then ardour starts up. 1 time in 10, Clementine will crackle like
crazy and then it will die and/or the server will die. Not using
Clementine, 1 in 15 times that I run Ardour, I can kill the server.

I also bisected it down to fons' topological sort patch. Which is a problem
because in some ways that's the biggest reason for this new release :(
