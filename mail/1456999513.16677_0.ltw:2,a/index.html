&gt;&gt; I have seen issues, too. I get heavily crackled sound on a first
&gt;&gt; clients audio output upon loading of a second client into the
&gt;&gt; graph. The crackling sometimes disappears when loading a third
&gt;&gt; client. The server may also crash sometimes while crackling along.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have bisected it down to:
&gt;&gt; 423931219dd3e3b669fde97786cadae92c066dc1 before that I do not seem
&gt;&gt; to experience these crackles.
&gt;
&gt; I get the crackles *sometimes*. My general setup is Clementine
&gt; playing audio, then ardour starts up. 1 time in 10, Clementine will
&gt; crackle like crazy and then it will die and/or the server will die.
&gt; Not using Clementine, 1 in 15 times that I run Ardour, I can kill the
&gt; server.
&gt;
&gt; I also bisected it down to fons' topological sort patch. Which is a
&gt; problem because in some ways that's the biggest reason for this new
&gt; release :(
&gt;

i must say that i can also now definitely confirm that the issue below, 
that i've reported earlier as garbled sound on pulseaudio+alsa_midi 
driver, is introduced by this very same "Fons' topological sort" commit.

only that the "crackling" does occur *always* on me (if not dead silence).

funny enough, in my case at least, on all tests i've tried, and they 
were a lot during the past week, it only occurred deterministically 
speaking, when pulseaudio-jack-sink and -source modules were up and 
jackd had the alsa_midi slave driver loaded (via -Xalsa_midi or -Xseq).

if the alsa_midi slave driver is not loaded, everything runs and sounds 
fine (apparently).

also, using a2jmidid as a backup alsa_midi bridge, the problem didn't 
manifest.

oh, and the new release has way more important fixes to me at least, 
like the fixes on the alsa_midi slave driver hotplug and freewheel 
handling and the metadata memory leaks and garbage/crash fixes. etc.

 &gt; not so fast, sorry. i missed to report one particular issue though:
 &gt;
 &gt; as a matter of fact, the alsa_midi driver eg. jackd -Xalsa_midi (or
 &gt; -Xseq), seems to severely interfere with pulseaudio and/or
 &gt; vice-versa. symptoms are that of all jack audio pcm sound getting
 &gt; horribly garbled if not silence most of the time and pulseaudio stops
 &gt; to function if at all. nb. though good old `a2jmidid -e &amp;` works fine
 &gt; instead.
 &gt;
 &gt; however, i am not sure this is incidental to 0.125.0rc1, as i
 &gt; believe the issue has been seen before and probably is related to
 &gt; some pulseaudio recent updates. btw. distro is opensuse tumbleweed
 &gt; which gets pervasive system updates, on a weekly basis
 &gt;
 &gt; again, to be clear, nothing about zombie clients or crashes
 &gt; experienced with 0.125.0rc1.
 &gt;
