i must say that i can also now definitely confirm that the issue below, 
that i've reported earlier as garbled sound on pulseaudio+alsa_midi 
driver, is introduced by this very same "Fons' topological sort" commit.

only that the "crackling" does occur *always* on me (if not dead silence).

funny enough, in my case at least, on all tests i've tried, and they 
were a lot during the past week, it only occurred deterministically 
speaking, when pulseaudio-jack-sink and -source modules were up and 
jackd had the alsa_midi slave driver loaded (via -Xalsa_midi or -Xseq).

if the alsa_midi slave driver is not loaded, everything runs and sounds 
fine (apparently).

also, using a2jmidid as a backup alsa_midi bridge, the problem didn't 
manifest.

oh, and the new release has way more important fixes to me at least, 
like the fixes on the alsa_midi slave driver hotplug and freewheel 
handling and the metadata memory leaks and garbage/crash fixes. etc.
