for all practical purposes it would be strange if the new sort patch would
behave the same as without the patch. the question is how it behaves
differently and the possible consequences it might impose on clients. i'm
sure fons did some tests.
apropos tests, a set of jack1/jack2 generic clients, setup in a series or
in parallel and configurable client "behaviour" in terms of cycle time
used, cpu .. could help to spot the differencies with numbers.
