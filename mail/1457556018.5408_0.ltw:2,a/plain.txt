Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Help for compiling jack2

Hi,

is it possible to help me building jack2, also for not so technical users?

Perhaps, it could then be possible, to help others and complete this page:

http://jackaudio.org/faq/build_info.html

At first, it’s importend to inform the user about necessary libs for
building. In other projects, it's find e.g. in a README. But here, I
cannot find it on the page above and also not in the git repo.

What I know is: build-essential

But what’s are the exact libs for this, not all libs are called like in
the error-messages, or we need the dev-variants:

Checking for program 'doxygen'           : not found
Checking for 'alsa' >= 1.0.18            : not found
--alsa requires the package alsa >= 1.0.18, but it cannot be found.
Checking for 'libffado' >= 1.999.17      : not found
--firewire requires the package libffado >= 1.999.17, but it cannot be
