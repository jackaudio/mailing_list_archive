Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Netjack crashes, alignment broken recently

Just compiled the latest jackd2, and when using Netjack both manager and 
driver crash after sending parameters. I traced back to this change from 
02f74a659, which modifies the network parameter struct:

--- a/common/JackNetTool.h
+++ b/common/JackNetTool.h
@@ -94,9 +94,9 @@ namespace Jack
-        char fName[JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE];
-        char fMasterNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE];
-        char fSlaveNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE];
+        char fName[JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE+1];
+        char fMasterNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE+1];
+        char fSlaveNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE+1];

That extra byte for the NUL terminator breaks the alignment, and somehow 
causes some ints to be sent as little-endian:

     Sample rate : 12288000 frames per second
     Period size : 131072 frames per period

Reverting the three lines seems to resolve the problem. I don't really 
see the use for having the NUL terminator go through the network...

What do you think?
