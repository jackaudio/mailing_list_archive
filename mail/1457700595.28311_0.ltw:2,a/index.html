I didn't closely look into this, but I guess this is what's happening:

https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/8b8be738805ae1c5fe3688a49fd696a9f080b59e/common/jack/systemdeps.h#L123

has

#if defined(__arm__) || defined(__ppc__) || defined(__powerpc__)
     #undef POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE
     #define POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE
#endif /* __arm__ || __ppc__ || __powerpc__ */

which disables

    #define POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE __attribute__((__packed__))

on the Raspberry (since it's ARM), but not on the amd64.

We then have

     struct _session_params
     {
         char fPacketType[8];                        //packet type ('param')
         uint32_t fProtocolVersion;                  //version
         int32_t fPacketID;                          //indicates the 
packet type
         char fName[JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE+1];          //slave's name
         char fMasterNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE+1]; //master hostname 
(network)
         char fSlaveNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE+1];  //slave hostname 
(network)
         uint32_t fMtu;                              //connection mtu
         uint32_t fID;                               //slave's ID
         uint32_t fTransportSync;                    //is the transport 
synced ?
         int32_t fSendAudioChannels;                 //number of 
master-&gt;slave channels
         int32_t fReturnAudioChannels;               //number of 
slave-&gt;master channels
         int32_t fSendMidiChannels;                  //number of

         int32_t fReturnMidiChannels;                //number of

         uint32_t fSampleRate;                       //session sample rate
         uint32_t fPeriodSize;                       //period size
         uint32_t fSampleEncoder;                    //samples encoder
         uint32_t fKBps;                             //KB per second for

         uint32_t fSlaveSyncMode;                    //is the slave in

         uint32_t fNetworkLatency;                   //network latency
     } POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE;

Since we're talking arm&lt;-&gt;amd64 here, alignment and/or byte ordering
is different. Been there in 2004 for powerpc&lt;-&gt;i386&lt;-&gt;amd64, but forgot
most of it. ;)

JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE+1 is most likely the absolute minimum, since we
need the space, at least on the host. Not on-wire, though (see (3)
below).

Options that might work:

(1) Reorder the struct and put char fName, fMasterNetName and
fSlaveNetName to the end, thus cheating a bit on the alignment issues.
The resulting strings would most likely be crippled. Just as a first
test. Or let's not do this, see (2) instead.

(2) Instead of +1, add +8. Since JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE==64 and
JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE==256, we'd be on 8-byte boundaries. This is a
trivial fix that doesn't rely on (1). Please try and report back.

(3) Define a wire-format that doesn't rely on POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE but
absolute offsets. Probably not too much work, just get the alignment
right and remove POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE from all on-wire structs. Use
union and byte positions instead.

(4) In conjunction with (3), use pahole(1) to clean up the codebase.
Investigate if dropping POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE entirely is possible.


3+4 are obviously heavy, so I'd go for (2) for now and see if it fixes
the problem.


There's another dirty alternative: if you don't want to add +8, your
only other minimally invasive option is to add +0, effectively reverting
the commit. For this to work, all write access to the three char fields
must make sure not to overrun the array and if in doubt drop the last
character in favour of the terminating NUL byte. It's error-prone and
should probably only be done via setter functions.


Again, my gut feeling from just looking at the struct is that adding +8
is a quick, safe and moderately clean solution. But don't publically
quote me on that. ;)

Disclaimer: it's been more than a decade now that I last dealt with that
stuff. Take everything above with a grain of salt.
