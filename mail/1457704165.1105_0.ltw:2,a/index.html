&gt;&gt; And then, instead of the expected 00 00 00 01 for fSendAudioChannels,
&gt;&gt; we have 00 00 00 00 01, which suggests the compiler has added a byte
&gt;&gt; of padding to align the int? I don't know.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't closely look into this, but I guess this is what's happening:
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/8b8be738805ae1c5fe3688a49fd696a9f080b59e/common/jack/systemdeps.h#L123

&gt;
&gt; #if defined(__arm__) || defined(__ppc__) || defined(__powerpc__)
&gt;      #undef POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE
&gt;      #define POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE
&gt; #endif /* __arm__ || __ppc__ || __powerpc__ */
&gt;
&gt; which disables
&gt;
&gt;     #define POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE __attribute__((__packed__))
&gt;
&gt; on the Raspberry (since it's ARM), but not on the amd64.

Ah! That seems to explain everything...

&gt; We then have
&gt;
&gt;      struct _session_params
&gt;      {
&gt;          char fPacketType[8];                        //packet type
&gt; ('param')
&gt;          uint32_t fProtocolVersion;                  //version
&gt;          int32_t fPacketID;                          //indicates the
&gt; packet type
&gt;          char fName[JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE+1];          //slave's name
&gt;          char fMasterNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE+1]; //master hostname
&gt; (network)
&gt;          char fSlaveNetName[JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE+1];  //slave hostname
&gt; (network)
&gt;          uint32_t fMtu;                              //connection mtu
&gt;          uint32_t fID;                               //slave's ID
&gt;          uint32_t fTransportSync;                    //is the transport
&gt; synced ?
&gt;          int32_t fSendAudioChannels;                 //number of

&gt;          int32_t fReturnAudioChannels;               //number of
&gt; slave-&gt;master channels
&gt;          int32_t fSendMidiChannels;                  //number of
&gt; master-&gt;slave midi channels
&gt;          int32_t fReturnMidiChannels;                //number of
&gt; slave-&gt;master midi channels
&gt;          uint32_t fSampleRate;                       //session sample rate
&gt;          uint32_t fPeriodSize;                       //period size

&gt;          uint32_t fKBps;                             //KB per second for
&gt; CELT encoder
&gt;          uint32_t fSlaveSyncMode;                    //is the slave in
&gt; sync mode ?
&gt;          uint32_t fNetworkLatency;                   //network latency
&gt;      } POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Since we're talking arm&lt;-&gt;amd64 here, alignment and/or byte ordering
&gt; is different. Been there in 2004 for powerpc&lt;-&gt;i386&lt;-&gt;amd64, but forgot
&gt; most of it. ;)
&gt;
&gt; JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE+1 is most likely the absolute minimum, since we
&gt; need the space, at least on the host. Not on-wire, though (see (3)
&gt; below).
 &gt;
&gt; Options that might work:
&gt;
&gt; (1) Reorder the struct and put char fName, fMasterNetName and
&gt; fSlaveNetName to the end, thus cheating a bit on the alignment issues.
&gt; The resulting strings would most likely be crippled. Just as a first
&gt; test. Or let's not do this, see (2) instead.
&gt;
&gt; (2) Instead of +1, add +8. Since JACK_CLIENT_NAME_SIZE==64 and
&gt; JACK_SERVER_NAME_SIZE==256, we'd be on 8-byte boundaries. This is a
&gt; trivial fix that doesn't rely on (1). Please try and report back.
&gt;
&gt; (3) Define a wire-format that doesn't rely on POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE but
&gt; absolute offsets. Probably not too much work, just get the alignment
&gt; right and remove POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE from all on-wire structs. Use
&gt; union and byte positions instead.
&gt;
&gt; (4) In conjunction with (3), use pahole(1) to clean up the codebase.
&gt; Investigate if dropping POST_PACKED_STRUCTURE entirely is possible.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 3+4 are obviously heavy, so I'd go for (2) for now and see if it fixes
&gt; the problem.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There's another dirty alternative: if you don't want to add +8, your
&gt; only other minimally invasive option is to add +0, effectively reverting
&gt; the commit. For this to work, all write access to the three char fields
&gt; must make sure not to overrun the array and if in doubt drop the last
&gt; character in favour of the terminating NUL byte. It's error-prone and
&gt; should probably only be done via setter functions.

That's what I had in mind when I made the PR. As you said it'd be error 
prone so yeah, I'd vote for (2), at least for now.

&gt; Again, my gut feeling from just looking at the struct is that adding +8
&gt; is a quick, safe and moderately clean solution. But don't publically
&gt; quote me on that. ;)
&gt;
&gt; Disclaimer: it's been more than a decade now that I last dealt with that
&gt; stuff. Take everything above with a grain of salt.
