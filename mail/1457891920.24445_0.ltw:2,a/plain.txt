memcpy is really cheap on modern machines (SSE), besides internally jack
uses zero-copy whenever possible: jack clients get a pointer to the
actual input/output buffer(s).

The process callback always runs for a couple of reasons: in your case
the oscillator's phase should advance sample-accurately regardless if
the output is connected or not.

But more importantly, for DSP one prefers consistent CPU usage.  Ideally
the process callback will always cause exactly the same CPU load, every
cycle, for all cycles.  Otherwise there's the potential: "It works
unless I connect things -> CPU spikes -> x-runs...")
