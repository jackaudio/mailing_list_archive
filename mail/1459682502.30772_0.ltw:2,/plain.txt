Any chance of adding in Praxis LIVE (www.praxislive.org)?  Not sure of
the best category for it mind you.

And, could you also update the JNAJack link to either
http://jaudiolibs.org or https://github.com/jaudiolibs preferably the
former?

AFAIK JJack is also dead - the berlios link definitely is.

Thanks and best wishes,

Neil
