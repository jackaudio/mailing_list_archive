Hi,

I' had a little bit effort to update jack2 for ubuntu 14.4.
With the help of the community, I was able to make it happen.

But for users, they don't have this possibility, it maybe good, when
some tutorials more for installing/updating are available.

My proposal is this.

Perhaps, jackaudio.org can have more informations for newbies about that?

Regards,
JÃ¶rg
