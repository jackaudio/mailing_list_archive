Might be worth adding to the Wiki, since it is highly specific. I'll
track it but can not look into it right now.

You could edit the wiki which should be writeable or include a link, I
am currently unsure and would have to review the structure of the Wiki
on where to include a link or the specific content, currently short on time.

Tracked here:
https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/issues/46
