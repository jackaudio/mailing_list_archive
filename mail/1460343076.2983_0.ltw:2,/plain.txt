Do you mean 1500k or 1500 bytes?  1500 bytes is the standard maximum
transmission unit (MTU) for Ethernet.  Anything over 1500 bytes is
considered jumbo frames.  Most switches can be configured to accept jumbo
frames but would drop them by default.

Your network stack should determine the MTU and only send packets that
size or below.

That is the job of the TCP part of the network stack, so it depends on
whether the protocol you are using uses TCP, UDP, or some other
application level protocol.
