Just for the record, I'm not familiar with audioadapter. I'm using 
zita-ajbridge, and it works very well.

Why are you using alsa tools when you are otherwise working with JACK? 
This will make the problem analysis more complicated...

If audioadapter works by just providing a big buffer (without any 
resampling), the reason would be clock drift. Such a minuscule clock 
drift between two consumer cards however would be sensationally good.

To be expected.

First of all, consider if you can actually sync the cards. If both have 
an SPDIF i/o, you can use that. Just connect the secondary card's SPDIF 
in to the master's SPDIF out (no matter whether you use toslink or RCA), 
and you can be sure your cards will be locked.

Secondly, try zita-ajbridge. If you can sync the cards in hardware, 
there is an option for zita-ajbridge to skip the resampling, which will 
conserve cpu power.

All best,


Jörn
