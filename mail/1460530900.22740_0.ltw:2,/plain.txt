Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Noisy Signal - Fragmented Data

hi,
Jacktrip uses UDP. 
We are on CERNET2 and Internet2 - good IPV6 networks.
Jacktrip in the common 8-channel case would then always
send Jumbo frames, right?

8 channels x 2 bytes (16bit)  x 128 buffer size = 2048

I wonder how we did this before without problems?
Is it the different treatment of MTU on ipv6?

Ken
