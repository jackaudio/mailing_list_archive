Subject:     [Jack-Devel] mips revisited

Hi there,

I have revisited running jackd (2) on a limited resource mips.
Managed to start it running now. Had to limit the number of ports and 
alter the postpacked structure alignment in a similar manner for the 
__arm__.

It starts and runs :
jackd -p 16 -d alsa -p 256 -i2 -o2
creating alsa driver ... hw:0|hw:0|256|2|48000|2|2|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit

This is great !

However, if I login to the system and try to run anything - the client 
fails like so ... whilst jackd keeps running ...

The jackd thread reports :

JackPosixProcessSync::LockedTimedWait error usec = 5000000 err = 
Operation timed out
Driver is not running
Cannot create new client
CheckSize error size = 32 Size() = 12
CheckRead error
CheckSize error size = -1 Size() = 4
CheckRead error
CheckSize error size = 0 Size() = 12
CheckRead error



jack_samplerate thread reports :

# jack_samplerate
Cannot read socket fd = 5 err = No error information
CheckRes error
JackSocketClientChannel read fail
Cannot open jack_samplerate client
JackShmReadWritePtr1::~JackShmReadWritePtr1 - Init not done for -1, 
skipping unlock
JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, 
skipping unlock
JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, 
skipping unlock
JACK server not running?

and ideas ?

thanks
Matt
