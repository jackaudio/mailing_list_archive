Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] mips revisited

Right !

In a constant state of XRun :

Jack: ALSA XRun wait_status = 0
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 1 fd = 8
Jack: JackRequest::Notification
Jack: JackEngine::ClientNotify: no callback for notification = 3
Jack: JackEngine::ClientNotify: no callback for notification = 3
Jack: **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least -32163500.032 msecs
