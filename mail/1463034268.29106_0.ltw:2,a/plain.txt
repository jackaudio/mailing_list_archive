YES (theoretically)

There is a way, by means of the metadata api [1] via the metadata key 
'http://jackaudio.org/metadata/order' [2], but the trio of JACK client, 
server and patchbay must support this for it to work.

* the client sets the order of its ports via 'jack_set_property'
* the server stores the metadata in a database
* the patchbay reads the metadata to order ports accordingingly

NO (practically)

* only few clients and patchbays support this yet
* JACK1 implements the metadata API, JACK2 still does NOT
