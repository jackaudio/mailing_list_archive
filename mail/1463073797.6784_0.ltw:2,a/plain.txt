No! 
If you are thinking of this, please don't remove alias support from Jack!
Or at least replace it with some default metadata containing similar 
 'friendly' port names, as I had requested some time ago.

Aliases (at least the default ones supplied by Jack)
 are very important for MusE.

We use them to reconnect ports that are not available,
 when those ports become available again. (USB midi etc.)
A sort of 'session management' feature. It works quite well.

The standard 'canonical' names (System::midi_playback_1)
 provided by ports are /not/ sufficient for this task
 since the numeric portion is derived from simple 'up counters'
 which change value every time a device is re-plugged.

I can provide more details if needed.
We look for which ever port name or alias does /not/ 
 contain the word 'System:', if possible.

Thanks.
Tim.
