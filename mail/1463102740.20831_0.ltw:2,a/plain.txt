Seems unlikely that Pro Tools is limited to 32 channels.
Mixbus uses jack directly, Pro Tools has to use jackrouter.  Did you read
and understand my previous message about the distinction between jack
(jack server) and jackrouter (driver which provides ASIO interface to
Windows apps, and jack ports to jack server)?  That extra layer
complicates matters and makes determining where the problem is occuring
more difficult.

How do you start jackd.exe?  The desktop shortcut described  on the
jackaudio.org web page I reference earlier?  Or some kind of graphical
program that lets you select parameters then start jackd.exe like
QJackControl?
Depending on the answer to that question, it should be possible to direct
you to the place where startup messages are emitted by the jack server,
and you can verify how many ports are created.
I'm not really familiar with jackrouter, so again, the Harrison forums
might lead you to people who are more knowledgeable about the Windows
specific quirks.
