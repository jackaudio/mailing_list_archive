Ah, sorry for the noise, again. I'm an email dinosaur.

When I last tried metadata several months ago I didn't seem
 to get any default pretty names. I was really worried...

So I just now built jack-1 and yes, pretty names are there in QJackCtl.

Tres cool ! 

Just to be clear, is it Jack which sets these default pretty strings?

Awesome, thanks Paul.

PS: Have you done anything with metadata tempo maps, in say Ardour?

Tim.
