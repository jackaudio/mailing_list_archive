You can't do duplex properly as a client. The main difference between a
JACK "driver" (aka "backend") and a client is that a driver consists of two
halves. One is executed at the start of a process cycle, to collect data
from the hardware; the other is executed at the end of a process cycle, to
deliver data to the hardware.

If you're not doing duplex, you can do whatever you want in a client, but
keep in mind that it cannot block, meaning that you basically have to
shuffle the data to/from another thread that actually interacts with the
hardware.

&gt; Hi.
&gt; I've been sinking lots of time in trying to get ALSA to work with a
&gt; SGTL5000 (Teensy Audio Adapter) in Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 3. I have the
&gt; complete documentation for how to manually set up the audio chip, and
&gt; sufficient documentation on how to manually set up the Pi's ARM I2S
&gt; peripheral. The ALSA solution is generalized for any kind of hardware you
&gt; could want, is something I don't really want to know, at all, in my life,
&gt; and seems just far too complex when I have detailed guides for both the
&gt; audio chip and the CPU. The one combination of ALSA platform, machine and
&gt; codec drivers that I've managed to get sound from plays more than 2x too
&gt; fast and will not open with JACK.
&gt;
&gt; So, I'm reading about the JACK API, wondering about simply writing a C
&gt; program to configure and write to the Pi's built-in I2S FIFOs, without even
&gt; telling ALSA that I'm doing it; but I see that all JACK clients should use
&gt; callback functions. Still, audio input from JACK into a program using the
&gt; API is a regular thing, right? So how complicated might it be to set up
&gt; such a client that gets audio input from JACK and writes that to the chip's
&gt; I2S FIFO? My timing will be controlled by the audio chip, the Pi chip will
&gt; be a slave to it. So as long as my program writes to the transmit FIFO fast
&gt; enough, and waits if the FIFO is full, I think I don't need to worry about
&gt; synchronizing JACK exactly to the audio chip's clock... right?
&gt;
&gt; I'm just a little fuzzy on this timing part.
&gt; Thanks for any clarification.
