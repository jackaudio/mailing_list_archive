Thanks for the info, Paul.
So, are you basically saying I need an extra buffer? A client takes audio
input from the JACK server and writes it to a buffer, and I have to
manually tweak the size of that buffer to avoid over- or underruns, and
another thread writes from that buffer to the hardware I2S FIFO whenever
it's writable? If I understand the implications of clients being unable to
block as you say, the audio generation programs won't ever wait for my
improvised "driver"... but I'm not sure if I get why that's something to
worry about.

&gt; You can't do duplex properly as a client. The main difference between a
&gt; JACK "driver" (aka "backend") and a client is that a driver consists of two
&gt; halves. One is executed at the start of a process cycle, to collect data
&gt; from the hardware; the other is executed at the end of a process cycle, to
&gt; deliver data to the hardware.
&gt;
&gt; If you're not doing duplex, you can do whatever you want in a client, but
&gt; keep in mind that it cannot block, meaning that you basically have to
&gt; shuffle the data to/from another thread that actually interacts with the
&gt; hardware.

&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; I've been sinking lots of time in trying to get ALSA to work with a
&gt;&gt; SGTL5000 (Teensy Audio Adapter) in Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 3. I have the
&gt;&gt; complete documentation for how to manually set up the audio chip, and
&gt;&gt; sufficient documentation on how to manually set up the Pi's ARM I2S
&gt;&gt; peripheral. The ALSA solution is generalized for any kind of hardware you
&gt;&gt; could want, is something I don't really want to know, at all, in my life,
&gt;&gt; and seems just far too complex when I have detailed guides for both the
&gt;&gt; audio chip and the CPU. The one combination of ALSA platform, machine and
&gt;&gt; codec drivers that I've managed to get sound from plays more than 2x too
&gt;&gt; fast and will not open with JACK.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, I'm reading about the JACK API, wondering about simply writing a C
&gt;&gt; program to configure and write to the Pi's built-in I2S FIFOs, without even
&gt;&gt; telling ALSA that I'm doing it; but I see that all JACK clients should use
&gt;&gt; callback functions. Still, audio input from JACK into a program using the
&gt;&gt; API is a regular thing, right? So how complicated might it be to set up
&gt;&gt; such a client that gets audio input from JACK and writes that to the chip's
&gt;&gt; I2S FIFO? My timing will be controlled by the audio chip, the Pi chip will
&gt;&gt; be a slave to it. So as long as my program writes to the transmit FIFO fast
&gt;&gt; enough, and waits if the FIFO is full, I think I don't need to worry about
&gt;&gt; synchronizing JACK exactly to the audio chip's clock... right?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm just a little fuzzy on this timing part.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for any clarification.
