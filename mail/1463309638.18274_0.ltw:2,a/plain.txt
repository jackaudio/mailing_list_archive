Okay, I'm not sure if anyone's actually reading these reports but after 
some further experiments, I think I finally figured this out. Here's 
what I said in my original report:-

What seems to be happening is that the 64-bit installer is installing 2 
x 32-bit components, namely:-

       C:\Windows\System32\libjack.dll
       C:\Windows\System32\libjackserver.dll

These are in addition to their 64-bit counterparts which get installed 
here:-

       C:\Windows\libjack64.dll
       C:\Windows\libjackserver64.dll

I think it's those 32-bit components which cause Windows to offer the 
32-bit install location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Jack) instead of the 
more traditional C:\Program Files\Jack

Having said that... the installer for v1.9.10 seems to be the same - so 
maybe it's intentional?
