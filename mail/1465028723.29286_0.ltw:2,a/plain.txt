Looks okay to me; this is the approach I'd take as well.
Some things to note:

  - If computer A and computer B are connected by something other than 
cable, you might want to use NetJack1 (netone) instead of NetJack2. The 
latter is still pretty fragile to connections with packet loss or 
jitter, AFAIK.

  - NetJack1/2 don't propagate latency, so you'll theoretically 
experience some A/V delay when watching videos, for example. In 
practice, the difference is small enough that I've never knew it was there.

My five cents.
