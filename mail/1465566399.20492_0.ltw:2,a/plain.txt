Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] shm registry full errors

Well I understand but what I observe is that JACK has unpredictable amount
of total clients which is an issue, regardless if it's closer to 10 than
1000.

I have found out at least 3 conditions that affect this:

- compilation flags, which by the way may cause jack to segfault if they
are set too high

- parameter to jackd

- MAX_SHM_ID

I suggest integrating this into one runtime command line parameter.
