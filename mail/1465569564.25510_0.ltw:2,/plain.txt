client limits: i will leave the developer(s) of jack2 to comment on the
specifics. jack2 hard-codes more values than jack1.

the shared memory registry: you can't make its configuration a run-time
thing, because you'd have to ensure that the library and the server are
both given the same value.

MAX_SHM_ID is an operating system constant.

you are hitting the limit almost certainly because you are running far more
clients than JACK was designed to support.

every client with a process callback implies at least 1 extra context
switch during the process cycle. this does not and cannot scale with
contemporary operating systems and processors. context switches are cheap
but not free. doing hundreds of them per process cycle steals significant
amounts of time from what is available for actual signal processing.
