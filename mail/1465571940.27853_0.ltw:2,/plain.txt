that won't help.

well, as mentioned, you can't put things on the command line that have be
constant across the server and library. so there are some constants that
are going to be hard-coded whether you like it or not.

there is no "hard limit". the number of clients before there is so little
time left for the process cycle() depends on (a) what each client does (b)
how much time each client takes for its context switch (which is partially
a function of what it does) (c) the period size

as noted above, you cannot compute this number. it will vary dramatically
depending on the condition.
