&gt; A while ago I initiated work on a Linux driver for Line6 devices
&gt; (now under sound/usb/line6 in the Linux kernel tree). Some of these
&gt; devices have weird sample rates (39062.5Hz, derived from the 10MHz
&gt; USB clock divided by 256). The alsa_in and alsa_out jack clients
&gt; are convenient tools to use such Line6 devices together with more
&gt; standardized hardware operating at, e.g., 48kHz. However, alsa_in
&gt; only supports integer sample rates, and even after a couple of minutes,
&gt; alsa_in doesn't detect the correct resampling factor 1.2288 (48000/39062.5),
&gt; but still reports the initial approximated value 1.228816 (48000/39062).
&gt; Admittedly, the error isn't too big, but is larger than the error of
&gt; high-quality crystal oscillators. And, after all, why use an approximation
&gt; if we know better?

You could try zita-a2j and j2a (which are also provided by Jack1 as
internal clients) - they should have no problem syncing.

Anyway, the small initial error doesn't matter at all since these
programs will sync to the *actual* sample rate. The nominal value
is just a starting point, and the rounding error (approx 0.0013%
for your example) is much smaller than the random error that can
be expected between any two devices.
