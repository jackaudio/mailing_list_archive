You could try zita-a2j and j2a (which are also provided by Jack1 as
internal clients) - they should have no problem syncing.

Anyway, the small initial error doesn't matter at all since these
programs will sync to the *actual* sample rate. The nominal value
is just a starting point, and the rounding error (approx 0.0013%
for your example) is much smaller than the random error that can
be expected between any two devices.
