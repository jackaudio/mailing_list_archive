Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Compiling jack2 in mixed mode

Hello

I have recently made stress tests of Jack under load and above +/- 100
clients it starts to behave strange.

Generally speaking it seem to not be designed for such use cases -  see my
discussion on this list  2-3 weeks ago.

I am working on replacement and maybe what I do will be helpful, please PM
me at [hidden] if you want to talk.
