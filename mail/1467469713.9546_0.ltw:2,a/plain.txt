Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Compiling jack2 in mixed mode

Paul,

By limitations I meant not latency but various undocumented hard-coded
limits such as one with SHM and generally speaking poor error handling if
they are hit, at least in jack2. Latency is not always an issue.

My approach  also removes single router such as jackd that has to do loads
of context switches per each cycle if there are many clients and uses more
distributed approach.

But hard sync is not my requirement.
