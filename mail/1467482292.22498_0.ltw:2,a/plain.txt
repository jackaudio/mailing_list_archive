True, assuming you have single linear chain of 100 clients, and
each step involves a context switch.

In practice there are two factors that mitigate this problem:

1. Parts of the graph may run in parallel. And SMP systems
   are more or less standard today.

2. Linear chains could be in the same process. In that case,
   depending on implementation, you don't even need a thread
   switch.

Exploiting both conditions at the same time requires some
intricate logic, but it's certainly possible. I have a
'proof of concept' actually running. The big remaining
question that needs to be resolved before this gets turned
into something real is if I want to support existing Jack
clients (via a replacement libjack on top of the new API).
Doing that complicates things quite a bit, but I haven't
abandoned the idea.
