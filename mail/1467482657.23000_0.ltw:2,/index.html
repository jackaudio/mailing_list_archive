&gt; &gt; context switches are not free. their cost varies depending on the size of
&gt; &gt; the working set of the process (the amount of memory touched by the
&gt; &gt; process, notably during the JACK process() callback).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; they might vary from &lt;10 usecs to as much as 500usecs (the lowest
&gt; possible
&gt; &gt; number is dependent on your CPU; the upper bound depends on the clients)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 100 * 100 usecs = 10msecs
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so, you've just used 10msecs of the time available for the process
&gt; &gt; callback. That's enormous (quite possibly larger than the actual time
&gt; &gt; available).
&gt;
&gt; True, assuming you have single linear chain of 100 clients, and
&gt; each step involves a context switch.
&gt;
&gt; In practice there are two factors that mitigate this problem:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Parts of the graph may run in parallel. And SMP systems
&gt;    are more or less standard today.
&gt;

4-8 core systems are more or less standard. So this only reduces the cost
in the best possible scenario by a factor of 4-8. In more common cases, the
improvement is much less.


&gt;
&gt; 2. Linear chains could be in the same process. In that case,
&gt;    depending on implementation, you don't even need a thread
&gt;    switch.
&gt;

Actually, I misspoke - this is already implemented. Internal clients will
be executed in the same thread if they are part of a serial chain.

IMO, the reality is that chaining together entirely independent signal
processing code is best done via plugins (internal clients, in a JACK
context), not processes. The clever hack that JACK represents is useful for
connecting small numbers of processes, but I don't believe that the design
should be used as an indication that process-level chains are the right way
to composite signal processing elements.
