Also this is interesting: http://halide-lang.org/  It's for images,
but just take away a dimension and it looks like audio.

Audio processing can be very data parallel so I'm surprised I haven't
seen any work related to audio on a GPU.  Maybe it's not so suitable
after all.

&gt; Faust was the first thing that came to mind indeed! The introduction
&gt; paragraphs in the documentation says
&gt;
&gt; -specification language
&gt; -describe signal processors from a mathematical point of view
&gt; -free from implementation details
&gt;
&gt; But right after that:
&gt; -FAUST programs are fully compiled, not interpreted.
&gt;
&gt; I can imagine to bundle FAUST code from different processors
&gt; semi-automatically or handcrafted to one unit relatively easily. However i
&gt; was thinking in a direction where the units live in a host still as single
&gt; units, to be connected in different ways, and the host would dynamically
&gt; derive a single math operation of the current graph. I understand this
&gt; would include recompilation or some kind of JIT compilation in order to
&gt; work. If possible at all, i think Faust would currently be the best fit,
&gt; since it already offers some of the fundamental concepts needed to even
&gt; think about doing something like this. That would allow large graphs with
&gt; almost no context switches (this is pure speculation).

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt; i wondered if the following scenario could work. Assuming DSP is
&gt;&gt;&gt; basically maths, and the formula and variables for every plugin would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; known, would it then be possible to magically simplify all formulas of
&gt;&gt;&gt; all plugins to one single formula doing all in one step? Does this sound
&gt;&gt;&gt; weird? Greetings
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom
