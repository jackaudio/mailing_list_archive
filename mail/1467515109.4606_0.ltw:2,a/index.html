&gt;&gt;&gt; Faust :  http://faust.grame.fr
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Faust was the first thing that came to mind indeed! The introduction
&gt;&gt; paragraphs in the documentation says
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -specification language
&gt;&gt; -describe signal processors from a mathematical point of view
&gt;&gt; -free from implementation details
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But right after that:
&gt;&gt; -FAUST programs are fully compiled, not interpreted.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can imagine to bundle FAUST code from different processors
&gt;&gt; semi-automatically or handcrafted to one unit relatively easily. However
&gt;&gt; i was thinking in a direction where the units live in a host still as
&gt;&gt; single units, to be connected in different ways, and the host would
&gt;&gt; dynamically derive a single math operation of the current graph. I
&gt;&gt; understand this would include recompilation or some kind of JIT
&gt;&gt; compilation in order to work. If possible at all, i think Faust would
&gt;&gt; currently be the best fit, since it already offers some of the
&gt;&gt; fundamental concepts needed to even think about doing something like
&gt;&gt; this. That would allow large graphs with almost no context switches
&gt;&gt; (this is pure speculation).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You are cordially invited to provide a faust implementation of 1 or more
&gt; of the following:
&gt;
&gt; Ardour
&gt; QTractor
&gt; Bitwig/Live
&gt; Kontakt
&gt; FreqTweak
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; When done, for bonus points, convince the members of the plugin
&gt; development communities to implement their work in Faust and make the
&gt; Faust code
&gt; available for refactoring by the sort of algorithm Stephane referenced in
&gt; his reply.
&gt;
&gt; There were plugin APIs long before JACK came along. JACK has very little
&gt; to do with the lower level aspects of how to chain together DSP blobs (aka
&gt;  plugins) in arbitrary ways, and everything to do with how to connect
&gt; applications together.
&gt;
&gt; There are all kinds of cool ideas for how to do things inside a single
&gt; process - Faust is one of them. The inter-application stuff is really a
&gt; different ball of wax. Fons sounds as if he has some interesting insights
&gt;  there, but it would be hard to integrate them into any host that wants
&gt; to be able to run without JACK.
&gt;

agreed, points taken.
Given that a processing graph doesn't change constantly (except in some
special cases), i'd imagine to kind of "freeze" the plugins setup to a
single instance to gain more room per cycle. Maybe this is just a pipe
dream. Having all involved DSP in a declarative text language instead of
BLOBs. Whole DAWs could be built like this. As i said, just a pipe dream
:)
