But parts of the FX chain are often bypassed.

Can't freeze everything - because then you can't bypass...

And FAUST comes with one complication in this area  - there is no "turn
off" switch.
To "bypass" something in FAUST, you compute it anyway, and then multiple
the output by zero.
Although this works, it is not a viable solution for complex synths -
Sorcer[1] only has 3 wavetables
because adding more means more CPU per voice.

Don't get me wrong - I really like FAUST, and it is extremely powerful for
certain use cases - but building
DAWs or "configurable" audio processors is not one. Building DSP blocks
that can be used by a DAW or
configurable audio processors is its strength - and its awesome for that.

Cheers, -Harry
