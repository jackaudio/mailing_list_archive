&gt;&gt; Given that a processing graph doesn't change constantly (except in some
&gt;&gt;  special cases), i'd imagine to kind of "freeze" the plugins setup to a
&gt;&gt;  single instance to gain more room per cycle. Maybe this is just a pipe
&gt;&gt;  dream. Having all involved DSP in a declarative text language instead
&gt;&gt; of BLOBs. Whole DAWs could be built like this. As i said, just a pipe
&gt;&gt; dream
&gt;
&gt; Keep in that in all but the simplest algorithms, audio processing doesn't
&gt;  just involve calculations on samples, but also logic, maintaining state,
&gt;  and in general things that don't happen at the audio sample rate but
&gt; have their own independent timing which isn't regular and can't be
&gt; predicted. Faust isn't particularly good at any of that.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In theory all of that could be expressed in a 'formula', but the
&gt; complexity of such a formula will explode exponentially unless you express
&gt; it as a chain or graph of separete operations with no or limited
&gt; interaction. And then we are back where we started.
&gt;

it's a very theoretical thing indeed, with the premise that as long as a
plugin acts deterministically, it could be expressed as a formula (which
can get large/complex). That alone doesn't make it "better" or solve any
problem yet, easy to agree.

&gt; You may think that running the entire combined algorithm sample per
&gt; sample, avoiding all intermediate buffers, would be more efficient than
&gt; having separate modules which communicate by passing blocks of samples
&gt; between them. But that is NOT the case. Short loops using a small set of
&gt; variables make much better use of CPU registers and the cache, and will be
&gt; faster.
&gt;
&gt; In other words, even if it would practically possible to do what you
&gt; suggest, nothing will be gained, on the contrary.
&gt;

OK. Thanks for your insights Fons! As always much appreciated.

&gt; Ciao,
