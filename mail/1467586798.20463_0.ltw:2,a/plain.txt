it's a very theoretical thing indeed, with the premise that as long as a
plugin acts deterministically, it could be expressed as a formula (which
can get large/complex). That alone doesn't make it "better" or solve any
problem yet, easy to agree.

OK. Thanks for your insights Fons! As always much appreciated.
