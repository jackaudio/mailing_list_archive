This is not by itself a limitation of this kind of approach : Faust (for now) is mainly designed to code synchronous mono-rate DSPs and the purpose of my previous mail was to explain that some categories of graphs where each node is coded in Faust can be automatically rewritten (and the compiled) into a single equivalent (possibly more efficient) node. No more no less.

The point can be : what kind of language and tools do we use to code our audio programs : the functional paradigm has some quality by itself that can help in some specific areas.
