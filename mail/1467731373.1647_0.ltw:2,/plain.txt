There is an experimental branch on Faust GIT called "master-with-mute » which allows to « dynamically bypass » computation of parts of the graph.

Well in this community you have 1) lots of experienced C/C++ developers that have developed tools for years… with the power and limits of the kind of imperative languages they use. And you have 2) some crazy people that try (for years also..) to approach the problem with alternate visions, like  : how can functional languages help? How can dynamic compilation help? how can partial evaluation help ? (to name a few…) 

Since people from 2) cannot solve everything for now at least, people from 1) say that in the end, you are going to have to use the good old tools to solve the problem… ((-;

But the 2) people stil think that for sure : this is not completely crazy to think about…
