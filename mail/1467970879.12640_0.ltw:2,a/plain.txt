Subject:     [Jack-Devel] A way to get notified when the current timebase master resigns?

Hey guys,

Currently I am hacking in Jack transport support for a certain project.
And while doing that, I am wondering whether it is possible to get a 
notficiation when the current timebase master has stepped down.

Bascially what I have in mind for my client:

  * During startup, check if there is a timebase master and if not, be it
    (which I know is possible with jack_set_timebase_callback(..,1,...)).
  * In case there was another timebase master that resigns at a certain point 
    in time (leaves the graph, steps down for some reason,...),
    take over the timebase.

I couldn't figure out a way to get a notification (callback etc.) that the  
current timebase master just has stepped down.

Is there one? If not, is there a specific reason for that?

Your help would be highly appreciated.  

Kind regards,
micu
