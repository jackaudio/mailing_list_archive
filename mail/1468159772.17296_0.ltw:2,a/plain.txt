Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] netJACK2 with two nodes

First of all, thanks, Xavier, for your comments.

I now got the hardware and I tried to set it up following this: https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/WalkThrough_User_NetJack

Short story: It doesn’t work.

Long story: When I rung the 'jack_netsource' command, I start to get resync-messages (see log at the end of the message). On both machines, nothing shows up in the qjackctl-patchbay so I don’t know where to route my sound from machine A to B. I’ve no sound so far on B.

I’d appreciate your help with this!
