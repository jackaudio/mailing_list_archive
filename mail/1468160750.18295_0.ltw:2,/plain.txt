This is a slightly odd approach in some way. Computer B basically has
nothing to do. All the hard work happens on A, and if the machine is
overloaded, the sound will still be affected. Normally, you'd use this sort
of design to spread the "load" around, but what you're proposing isn't
really spreading any load at all. Any time A is overloaded, it makes no
difference that B is running fine - the sound will still glitch.
