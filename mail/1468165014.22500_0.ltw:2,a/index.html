A cable would be just fine if both computers where not so far away. Believe me, it would be a lot easier for me, too.

&gt; why not just run cables? what is computer B doing? basically nothing ...

&gt;     The reason I&#x2019;m doing this is that I don&#x2019;t want my loud working machine A in my studio. It sits somewhere else and in my studio I only have the fanless thinclient B. Is there a better way to do this?

&gt;&gt;     This is a slightly odd approach in some way. Computer B basically has nothing to do. All the hard work happens on A, and if the machine is overloaded, the sound will still be affected. Normally, you'd use this sort of design to spread the "load" around, but what you're proposing isn't really spreading any load at all. Any time A is overloaded, it makes no difference that B is running fine - the sound will still glitch.

&gt;&gt;         Hello JACK community,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         I&#x2019;m planning my new audio editing setup (both hard- and software) and before investing in hardware, I&#x2019;d like to ask for advice.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Here&#x2019;s what I want to do:
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; Both computers run Linux.
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; On Computer A, I can browse the web and see Youtube videos, I can listen to MP3 files with Totem and I can do DAW stuff with Ardour.
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; Computer B does nothing more than getting all the sound output from A and feed it to the speaker through it&#x2019;s soundcard.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Here&#x2019;s my theoretical approach:
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; Both computers run JACK.
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; A runs PulseAudio in top of JACK.
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; A runs with the net backend using netJACK2.
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; B has the Net Manager loaded which gets the audio from A and pipes it to the soundcard.
&gt;&gt;         &#x2013; Every time I boot the two computers, they are ready to work. No daemons I have to launch manually, etc. I want the configuration to be done one time for all.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         I got my understanding of JACK through the network from here: https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/WalkThrough_User_NetJack2 And this site would also be my guide for setting up the thing.
&gt;&gt;         But I&#x2019;m not a JACK expert at all. It&#x2019;s the first time I&#x2019;m doing something like this. So I want to make shure I got the basics right. And, maybe you now even a better step-by-step tutorial which does exactly what I want.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         So, I appreciate any comments on this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Bye,
&gt;&gt;         xan
