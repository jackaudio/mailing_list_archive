A cable would be just fine if both computers where not so far away. Believe me, it would be a lot easier for me, too.

Normally, you'd use this sort of design to spread the "load" around, but what you're proposing isn't really spreading any load at all. Any time A is overloaded, it makes no difference that B is running fine - the sound will still glitch.
