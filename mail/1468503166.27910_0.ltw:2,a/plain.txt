Hi Xan,
my two cents here too.
in a similar setup zita* stuff has not worked great for me - I got alot of
noise , so I switched to using the more primitive alsa_in and alsa_out.
just keep in mind you may find more suitable as well.

you may also find useful the "jcmess" - a cli tool to automate
loading/saving jack connections (as these appear on qjackctl). you can find
it on github

Hope this helps!
