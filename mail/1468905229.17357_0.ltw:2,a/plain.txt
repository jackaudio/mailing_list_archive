Hi Fons,
i'm not implying there was something wrong with zita-*2*, i'm sure in fact
it is some network issue that caused the jitter from the speakers, it was
nonetheless a jitter.
Now where zita-*2* offered jitter ,alsa_* did not , provided the same
arguments where used (ie for low latency).

I am sure had I spend more time on it I would have found a solution - i do
not question zita-* is "future" while alsa_* is "obsolete", but for the
given transition to zita-* , I had to revert to alsa_*
