Subject:     [Jack-Devel] alsa_out alternative for OSX

Hello,

I have a Linux computer that is running a recording. I'd like to be able to
also stream what is recorded to another computer through the network and
listen to that with the speakers. I'm using Jack 1. I'm running jackd -d
net on the slave computer, and jack_netsource on the recording one. Then,
to play the sound through the speakers, I run alsa_out on the slave
computer and connect the appropriate ports.

Now I'd like to be also able to listen on a computer with OSX (the
recording computer stays the same). I've installed jack from Macports, but
there is no Alsa for OSX. What can I do to get the same result?

Thank you,
Michal Badura
