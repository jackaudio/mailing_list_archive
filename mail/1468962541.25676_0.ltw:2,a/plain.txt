Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] alsa_out alternative for OSX

Yeah, it seems that I can use netjack on both systems, because I was able
to run jackd -d net on OSX.

The problem is connecting output of the jack server running with the net
backend to the soundcard on OSX. On Linux I did it using alsa_out, which
creates Jack ports for the soundcard inside a Jack server running with
another backend, such as netjack.

(sorry, resending to send this to the list as well)
