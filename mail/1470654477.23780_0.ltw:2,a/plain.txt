Subject:     [Jack-Devel] FFADO 2.3.0 released

The FFADO developers are pleased to announce FFADO version 2.3.0, a package
of userspace drivers for firewire audio interfaces.  While there are no
significant new features in this version compared to the last, FFADO 2.3.0
contains a large number of incremental improvements.  Users of FFADO are
encouraged to upgrade.

This source-only release can be downloaded from the ffado.org website at

Notable changes include:
 * Configuration entries added for additional devices which work with the
   generic support layer (PreSonus Studiolive 32.4.2, Presonus StudioLive
   16.0.2, ICON FireXon, Onyx Blackbird and the new Onyx 1640i, among
   others).
 * Support added for the newer Focusrite Saffire Pro 26.
 * Improved build support for various downstream consumers.
 * Better routing for selected Saffire devices and the Firestudio Mobile.
 * Significant cleanup and refinement of the M-Audio and Yamaha driver.
 * Compilation fixes for recent versions of gcc.
 * Recover from dead streams without causing jackd to shut down.
