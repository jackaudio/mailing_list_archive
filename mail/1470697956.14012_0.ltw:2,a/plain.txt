The StudioLive 16.x series seems to mostly work although there is still a
little uncertainty about playback though (see the "PreSonus StudioLive
16.0.2 support" thread on the ffado-user list for example).  For some users
it works fine while for others playback is muted (recording works for
everyone who has reported test results).  It is not clear whether this
discrepancy was due to FFADO version, distribution, some system
configuration issue or some other as yet unidentified effect.  Work on this
continues.

That is almost certainly true - I have been a little slow to update the
device matrix of late.  I will try to make some time to bring it up to date
with the 2.3.0 release.  Thanks for the prompt.
