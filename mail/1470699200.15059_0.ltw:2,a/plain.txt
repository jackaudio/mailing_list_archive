At this stage we don't.  If the Eigenmike's firewire interface is provided
by a generic chipset (such as BeBoB or DICE) then it's possible that the
only thing needed to support it is a configuration entry mapping the
vendor and model ID to the appropriate driver.  To get the vendor and model
IDs we would need someone with an Eigenmike to obtain this information from
the device.

According to the em32 release notes[1] it seems that this device uses the
DICE chipset.  It is therefore possible that FFADO would support audio
streaming from this microphone if we knew the vendor and model IDs using the
generic DICE driver.  It would have to be tested.  The release notes go on
to say that the microphone can be controlled to a certain extent from the
computer.  This involves a virtual MIDI stream but the nature of this is not
clear: it could use standard MIDI commands according to a published MIDI
map, or it might use a proprietary command stream embedded in sysex
messages.  Obviously FFADO will not support this until someone is able to
identify the nature of the control methods so appropriate software can be
written.

We would of course welcome contributions which lead to FFADO support for the
Eigenmike.
