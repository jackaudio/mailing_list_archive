Hi,

after some weeks of silence, I got back to this issue. I installed zita-njbridge on both my machines, started the JACK server and tried to run the commands.

'zita-j2n b`s-ip port' is running on A and 'zita-n2j a`s-ip port' is running on B.
However, I don`t know the port I`m supposed to use and I couldn` find out.

The command seems to run on A but fails on B: "Failed to connect to socket. Cannot assign request address."

I`d appreciate some debugging here.

Thanks in advance,
xan.

&gt; Hi Fons,
&gt; i'm not implying there was something wrong with zita-*2*, i'm sure in fact it is some network issue that caused the jitter from the speakers, it was nonetheless a jitter.
&gt; Now where zita-*2* offered jitter ,alsa_* did not , provided the same arguments where used (ie for low latency).
&gt;
&gt; I am sure had I spend more time on it I would have found a solution - i do not question zita-* is "future" while alsa_* is "obsolete", but for the given transition to zita-* , I had to revert to alsa_*

&gt;     &gt; in a similar setup zita* stuff has not worked great for me - I got alot of
&gt;     &gt; noise , so I switched to using the more primitive alsa_in and alsa_out.
&gt;
&gt;     There a many ways a link using zita-*2* can go wrong, depending on
&gt;     network performance and if your Jack systems by themselves are OK
&gt;     or not. But 'noise' is not one of the possible results.
