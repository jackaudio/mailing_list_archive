Thanks for the hint! It took me quite a while, though, to get these programs to work properly, for two reasons:

1.) Out of the box, zita-a2j/j2a wouldn't start at all with my device since no exact (integer) frame rate could be set. I therefore did the same exercise as with alsa_in/out to support fractional frame rates (see attached file "zita-exact-rate.patch"). I hoped it would also converge faster to the correct frame rate if a correct initial value was given, which I could indeed observe occasionally, but on average there was no difference in convergence time. At least the error displayed in verbose mode now exactly represents the relative error between the internal clock sources of both devices :-), which is reasonably small.

2.) After having fixed the initialization issue, I noticed that after a couple of minutes zita_a2j/j2a stop working with the message "Detected excessive timing errors, waiting 10 seconds." and would not recover from this. I added some additional debugging output and tracked this issue down to the point that the problem occurs immediately after the internal timer (lower 28 bits of the jack timestamp) overflows. Therefore I modified the code such that the full 64 bit jack timestamp is used wherever possible (see attached file "zita-jacktime.patch") to get rid of overflow issues (well, almost, the jack timer overflows after more than half a million years :-).

Could you please review the patches and let me know what you think about these?

        Thanks & kind regards,
