Intersting, I've been seriously contemplating changing MusE's
 internal frame type from integer to double or long double, 
 becuase I've been finding some non-trivial timing errors 
 that can't be ignored now, requiring fractional frame values.

I never had a super in-depth look at floating point so I researched
 and concluded the same thing, that a double or long double should 
 be able to represent the whole integer range that we've been using,
 without error. This would allow us fractional values.

Cheers.
Tim.
