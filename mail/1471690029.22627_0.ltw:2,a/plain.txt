Since you're using Jack I assume you know the basics...
which include that you have to connect things (which 
can be automated of course).

OK, you could also make the connection in Ardour.

OK.

Yes. You could try --buff 100 on the receiver. This will provide 100 ms
of extra buffering.

Hmm, did you just connect the ethernet cable and then use the same IP
addresses ? In that case you're still using the Wifi...
 
Are you using Jack in real-time mode (this is absolutely essential) ? 
Check the top line of qjackctl's display, it should show 'RT' in
the top line (just left of the % CPU indication).
