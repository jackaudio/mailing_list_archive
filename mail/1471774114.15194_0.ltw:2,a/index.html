&gt; 1.) Out of the box, zita-a2j/j2a wouldn't start at all with my device

&gt; same exercise as with alsa_in/out to support fractional frame rates
&gt; (see attached file "zita-exact-rate.patch"). I hoped it would also
&gt; converge faster to the correct frame rate if a correct initial value
&gt; was given, which I could indeed observe occasionally, but on average
&gt; there was no difference in convergence time.

There shouldn't be. The settling time is determined by the loop
bandwidth. 

Which distro are you using ? Zita-alsa-pcmi is *not* part of
zita-ajbridge, it's a separate library, used by a number of other
apps.

Anyway, your patch would mean an incompatible change to the API,
and that's not going to happen. I'll see if and how I can support
fractional sample rates in another way. 

Anyway, even set_rate_near() takes an int as parameter, so there
is no point in using a float, except for the test 

  rate_num != _fsamp * rate_den

but this will fail anyway unless you are lucky and _fsamp is
an _exact_ floating point representation of num / den.

So the solution could be to use set_rate_near() and replace
the test with something more robust.


&gt; 2.) After having fixed the initialization issue, I noticed that
&gt; after a couple of minutes zita_a2j/j2a stop working with the message
&gt; "Detected excessive timing errors, waiting 10 seconds." and would
&gt; not recover from this. I added some additional debugging output
&gt; and tracked this issue down to the point that the problem occurs
&gt; immediately after the internal timer (lower 28 bits of the jack 
&gt; timestamp) overflows.

That's very likely just a coincidence. I'm pretty sure the code
handles the mod 2^28 format correctly, but I'll verify this again.

&gt; Therefore I modified the code such that the full 64 bit jack
&gt; timestamp is used wherever possible (see attached file
&gt; "zita-jacktime.patch") to get rid of overflow issues (well,
&gt; almost, the jack timer overflows after more than half a million
&gt; years :-).

Assuming it starts at zero.

The reduction to 28 bits requires extra code, which means it was
not done without reason. One reason is that I want the loop
calculations to be independent of details such as the format of
the timers used, and use consistent units (seconds).
