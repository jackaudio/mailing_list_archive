Isn't this just a modified version of the simple_client.c example client?

No it does NOT do "bi-directional" audio streaming. Please look up the
term "bi-directional" and read the source code/comments.

Is suspect, that it only appears to be clearer instead of actually
clarifying things.

Personally I do not think that simple_client.c is substantially more
complicated, actually it is even simpler since it does not contain any
logic to generate a signal but instead just copies the input to the
output. It is even documented nicely, especially the process function.

I would recommend you to try to understand simple_client.c and instead
post what you do not understand. We may come to a conclusion when that
happens.
