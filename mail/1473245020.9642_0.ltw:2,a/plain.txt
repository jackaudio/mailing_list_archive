Seems like I can detect if jack is freewheeling by checking the return
value of
"jack_acquire_real_time_scheduling(client,
jack_client_real_time_priority(client))".
Now I can inform the user that something is wrong, and that's all that's
needed.

Also, calling "jack_set_freewheel(client, 0)" didn't quite work. It does
turn off freewheeling, and jack seems to work, but if trying to turn on
freewheeling again later, jack freezes. (at least with the old version
of jack I have installed)
