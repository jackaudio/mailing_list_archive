Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK1's Future?

Hi,

Back in January/February at the start of this year, Paul announced that 
he would be stepping down, and he requested that someone would stand for 
being the new maintainer.

As far as I know, this didn't happen, up until Filipe Coelho(?) offered 
to maintain JACK1. After speaking with Paul around March, he said that 
once Ardour 5.0 was released he would do the final release of JACK1 and 
then hand over maintainership.

There are a few pull requests on the GitHub, some of which are critical 
to the core functionality of JACK1, like the patch for OSX which begins 
to modernise JACK1's usages of the CoreAudio APIs (while still 
maintaining backward compatibility).

I'd like to help the JACK community in getting OSX support 
up-to-scratch. There is a promising project called CaptainJack 
(https://github.com/Qix-/CaptainJack) which aims to be a modern 
replacement for JackOSX, which is a vital part of the JACK ecosystem 
within OSX. While it is just a start, it shows there is at least some 
interest.

My question to the community is: Should an effort be put in to revive JACK1?

And to Paul; I know it's only been a little over a month since 5.0 was 
released, but is it possible you could do this 'final release' of JACK1 
soon so we can get the ball rolling again, or at least give some sort of 
time-frame on when this can be achieved.

I personally think there should be an effort, the main issue at this 
time is how the clients are sorted, and there is a patch for this. I 
would be willing to step forward to fix all the issues related to OSX, 
and reattempt integration of Fons' topological sort patch. In addition 
to this, JACK1 is a good code-base, albeit slightly outdated, which 
makes a great reference implementation for JACK3.
