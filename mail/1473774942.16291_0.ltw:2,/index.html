Once I get my current burst effort on Ardour's (broken) MIDI looping done,
I'll make it a priority to do my final JACK release and hand over to Filipe.

The background on Captain Jack's design sounds horrendous (thanks, Apple).

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Back in January/February at the start of this year, Paul announced that he
&gt; would be stepping down, and he requested that someone would stand for being
&gt; the new maintainer.
&gt;
&gt; As far as I know, this didn't happen, up until Filipe Coelho(?) offered to
&gt; maintain JACK1. After speaking with Paul around March, he said that once
&gt; Ardour 5.0 was released he would do the final release of JACK1 and then
&gt; hand over maintainership.
&gt;
&gt; There are a few pull requests on the GitHub, some of which are critical to
&gt; the core functionality of JACK1, like the patch for OSX which begins to
&gt; modernise JACK1's usages of the CoreAudio APIs (while still maintaining
&gt; backward compatibility).
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to help the JACK community in getting OSX support up-to-scratch.
&gt; There is a promising project called CaptainJack (
&gt; https://github.com/Qix-/CaptainJack) which aims to be a modern
&gt; replacement for JackOSX, which is a vital part of the JACK ecosystem within
&gt; OSX. While it is just a start, it shows there is at least some interest.
&gt;
&gt; My question to the community is: Should an effort be put in to revive
&gt; JACK1?
&gt;
&gt; And to Paul; I know it's only been a little over a month since 5.0 was
&gt; released, but is it possible you could do this 'final release' of JACK1
&gt; soon so we can get the ball rolling again, or at least give some sort of
&gt; time-frame on when this can be achieved.
&gt;
&gt; I personally think there should be an effort, the main issue at this time
&gt; is how the clients are sorted, and there is a patch for this. I would be
&gt; willing to step forward to fix all the issues related to OSX, and reattempt
&gt; integration of Fons' topological sort patch. In addition to this, JACK1 is
&gt; a good code-base, albeit slightly outdated, which makes a great reference
&gt; implementation for JACK3.
