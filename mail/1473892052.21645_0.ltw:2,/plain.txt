Subject:     [Jack-Devel] JACK1 0.125.0 is released

There's a new release JACK1 now available.

      http://jackaudio.org/downloads/jack-audio-connection-kit-0.125.0.tar.
gz

(tagged in git as 0.125.0)

Changes since 0.124.1, in rough order of significance:

   * in the alsa_midi slave driver, fix hotpug device enumeration. JACK1
will now respond
          to MIDI devices being connected and disconnected while running.
   * increase maximum size of a single JACK MIDI event to 64 bytes
   * in the alsa_midi slave driver, fix thread start/stop handling when
freewheeling
   * add support for jack_port_rename()
   * fix incorrect ALSA backend latency values when used with other than 2
periods/buffer.
   * drop support for CPU cycle counting clock, use kernel clocksource
instead
   * fix a double-fork that left zombie processes around
   * improve the validity and usability of the return value of
jack_frame_time()
   * fix failing metadata look up by clearing UUID parsing buffer before use
   * support unescaped double quotes in $HOME/.jackdrc
   * fix memory leaks of metata key/value pairs
   * fix crash caused by incorrect jack_error() format string
   * remove option help from jackd and point user at documentation
   * fix problems with garbage keys in metadata
   * fix negative x-run values on Linux with ALSA backend and kernel 4.0 or
later
   * build and run on openBSD with new sndio backend
   * fix out-of-tree builds
   * update configure.ac to work with current-ish autotools with less errors
   * fix building on MacOS 10.12 (Sierra) where clock_nanosleep() is not
available
   * enable use with Travis (continuous integration for OS X on github)
   * correctly avoid Valgrind warning in one instance.
   * use gcc atomics and CLOCK_REALTIME for generic CPU builds
   * a handful of other minor bug fixes

With this release of JACK1, I (Paul Davis) am stepping down from my
position as Benevolent Dictator for the project, and in all likelihood from
any active involvement with the continuing development of JACK1. Filipe
Coehlo (falktx to many of us) will be taking over my role as JACK1
maintainer, and I believe that this leaves the project in excellent hands.

JACK has been a long, strange and wondrous journey, and even if at this
point I lean towards thinking that the whole idea was a bit of a mistake (!
:), I want to thank all the amazing developers and users who contributed
their time, intelligence, insights and interest to the project, and hope
that it will continue forwards in the best possible way.
