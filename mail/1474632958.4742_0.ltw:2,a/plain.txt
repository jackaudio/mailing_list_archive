Definitely not. I guess you were thinking about some sub parts of jack when
you wrote this.
Firstly, jack provided a simple to use API to send and receive audio with
low latency to and from the soundcard.
Secondly, it made it possible for several programs to access the
soundcard simultaneously,
so you didn't have to start and stop programs all the time.
