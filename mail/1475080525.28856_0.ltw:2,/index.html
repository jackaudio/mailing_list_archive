&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt;
&gt; I have 2 PCs, both with a 64 channel madi card.  Machine 'A' is
&gt; runing Win7, and the RME TotalMix is running showing what is on each
&gt; channel.  I am also running Reaper, which has a plugin generating
&gt; tone on the 1st 8 channels which is visible on the TotalMix.
&gt;
&gt; Machine 'B' is a dual boot Win7/Ubuntu 16.04, and when booted into
&gt; Win7, the tone coming in on the madi stream channels 1-8 is clearly
&gt; present and audable.  When I boot into Ubuntu, I run QjackCtl and
&gt; start Jack.  I then start a simple program I have written from a
&gt; tutorial I found that copies from the inputs to the outputs.
&gt;  Unfortunately, nothing is received on the inputs.  On the outputs
&gt; however if I fill the output Buffer with random numbers, the resulting
&gt; noise appears on machine 'A', so not everything is a total disaster.
&gt;
&gt; I have checked alsamixer for muting on the inputs and am now at a loss
&gt; for possible causes. (I am summing the abs value of each frame in
&gt; input and periodically printf the total, which is always zero.
I am not completely sure, but kind of remember an option in alsamixer
for switching between MADI optical and BNC/coaxial for the
inputs/outputs, this might also be something you want to check.

Also, please test first with an application known to work, as mentioned
by others, Ardour for example.
