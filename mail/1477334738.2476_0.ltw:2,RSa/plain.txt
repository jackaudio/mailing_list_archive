Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack cannot run after re-installing

Hi,
I'm trying to use Jack with an Odroid-U3. I re-installed a Debian Wheezy
image which had Jack installed and was working fine with a Focusrite
Scarlett 2i4 sound card.
I did an "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade" and then I installed
libasound2-dev and libjack-dev because I wanted to compile Pure Data from
source, and these packages are necessary.
After compiling Pure Data I realized that Jack had been uninstalled (no
idea why), so I installed it again, along with Qjackctl, via apt-get.
Now when I try to run Jack through Qjackctl, with the same sound card, Jack
starts but after half a second it stops. Here are the messages I get:
