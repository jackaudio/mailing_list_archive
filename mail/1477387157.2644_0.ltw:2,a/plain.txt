As far as I remember the image was supposed to be a Jessie one, though when
I SSH to the Odroid the login is "odroid@odroid-wheezy". Can't remember who
made the image, all I remember is that it was posted as a Jessie image.
Here's what's in /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb http://ftp.gr.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.gr.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free

deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free

# jessie-updates, previously known as 'volatile'
deb http://ftp.gr.debian.org/debian/ jessie-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.gr.debian.org/debian/ jessie-updates main contrib
non-free

deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports non-free contrib main
deb-src http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports non-free contrib
main

deb http://ftp.at.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.at.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free


I guess that's why the Jessie version of Jack has been installed. I'm not
so Linux-savvy, so not really sure what I should do. Should I change all
"jessie" to "wheezy" in /etc/apt/sources.list?

Thanks for the hint!
