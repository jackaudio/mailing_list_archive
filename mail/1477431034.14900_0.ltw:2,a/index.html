&gt;&gt; When using aplay to help debug this it turns out that aplay does not
&gt;&gt; complain, and it happily plays the soundfile, but nothing comes out
&gt;&gt; of the speakers for the first few seconds - I presume until the card
&gt;&gt; switches sampling rate.
&gt;
&gt; Is that sampling rate actually set by aplay, or before by using HW
&gt; controls ?

Just using aplay alone... it plays "fine" except that it takes a few 
seconds for sound to actually appear in the outputs.

&gt;&gt; Once the sampling rate has been defined at least _once_ then Jack
&gt;&gt; has no problem to start (over and over again) and aplay plays files
&gt;&gt; with sound from the beginning.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you access the status and configuration web server in the Motu
&gt;&gt; you can switch the sampling rate and you see the clock lock icon
&gt;&gt; turn blinking red and then solid white once the change is done.
&gt;&gt; Also, alsamixer and amixer show a single read only "control" that is
&gt;&gt; actually the lock status indicator (the lsusb descriptors also show
&gt;&gt; another r/w control that can be used to _set_ the frequency but that
&gt;&gt; is somehow not reflected in the alsamixer/amixer interface).
&gt;
&gt; A few lines of python could probably set the sample rate using the
&gt; web interface, wait until the card is ready, then start Jack.
&gt; Or find out what's required on the usb endpoint that sets the
&gt; sample rate.

Or just have a script that tries to start jack, fails, waits a bit and 
tries again (replacing jackd - a nasty hack).

It would be best to not depend on the web interface as that might not be 
always available when we connect through usb.

I have not looked at the jack source to try to figure out why it is not 
working while aplay does - maybe the card no longer generates 
interrupts? Also, if the clock somehow changes while jack is running 
(for example I disconnect the clock source if slaving to external 
clock), jack goes into la-la land and we need to quit everything and 
restart it to get things going again. Too bad...[*]
