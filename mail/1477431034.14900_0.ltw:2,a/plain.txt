Just using aplay alone... it plays "fine" except that it takes a few 
seconds for sound to actually appear in the outputs.

Or just have a script that tries to start jack, fails, waits a bit and 
tries again (replacing jackd - a nasty hack).

It would be best to not depend on the web interface as that might not be 
always available when we connect through usb.

I have not looked at the jack source to try to figure out why it is not 
working while aplay does - maybe the card no longer generates 
interrupts? Also, if the clock somehow changes while jack is running 
(for example I disconnect the clock source if slaving to external 
clock), jack goes into la-la land and we need to quit everything and 
restart it to get things going again. Too bad...[*]
