&gt; &gt; As far as I remember the image was supposed to be a Jessie one, though
&gt; &gt; when I SSH to the Odroid the login is "odroid@odroid-wheezy".

&gt;
This gives jessie/sid


&gt; &gt; Should I change all "jessie" to "wheezy" in /etc/apt/sources.list?
&gt;
&gt; Not unless you are really running wheezy.  It seems much more likely that
&gt; you just forgot what you have installed than somehow getting jessie
&gt; sources configured on a wheezy installation.
&gt;
Aparently it's a Jessie image (checked online and saw that "sid" means
unstable, is that correct?)
I did a kernel update (since I was also trying to get access to some GPIOs
of the Odroid, and refreshind the kernel was necessary), and used this one
https://github.com/hardkernel/linux/tree/odroid-3.8.y
If I got it right, it was the latest that supported the U family of Odroid
(I'm using an Odroid-U3). Then I installed libasound2-dev and libjack-dev
cause I need them to compile Pure Data, but libjack-dev removes Qjackctl.
/usr/bin/jackd is still there, but calling it doesn't seem to take any
effect.
I tried the following:
/usr/bin/jackd -dalsa -r48000 -p1024 -n2 -Xraw -D -Chw:USB -Phw:USB

and seemed like Jack started, but when I launched Pure Data I got this:
[2]   Bus error               /usr/bin/jackd -dalsa -r48000 -p1024 -n2
-Xraw -D -Chw:USB -Phw:USB
odroid@odroid-wheezy:~$ connect(2) call to /tmp/jack-1000/default/jack_0
failed (err=Connection refused)

(even though the login says "odroid-wheezy" it seems that the image is
Jessie)

and Pure Data complained that Jack is not running.

Am I getting somewhere here?
