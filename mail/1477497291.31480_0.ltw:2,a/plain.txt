No. That will break things very badly.

For Debian 8 (Jessie), jessie/sid is correct. If a system is running sid
(as mine is) it will show stretch/sid.

I haven't read the whole thread, but this sounds an awful lot like
parallel installations of JACK. If you compiled from source, you MUST
remove ALL of Debian's JACK-related packages, some of which it installs
by default without asking. I have a reasonably reliable guide for
getting a solid, source-compiled JACK setup on Debian Jessie or Sid here:
