Yes, that is possible of course but is not a real solution as I see it, 
at least not something that is general purpose and I can deploy. I have 
to try to find our exactly how it is failing, for example printing the 
alsa hw/sw parameter space when it fails and when it succeeds (after all 
aplay manages to "play" in the same conditions).
