I could well be wrong; but my suspicion is not on audio threads - but
rather management threads for things like DBus integration, or other "non
realtime" operations. If it was the audio thread that was causing the
deadlock and spinning, you would hear *no* audio at all.

So next steps I'd suggest running without any extra features (disable Dbus
support, or Pulseaudio integration, or ALSA loopback devices, or anything
else that's not "core" JACK). See if it still happens..

Good luck! -Harry
