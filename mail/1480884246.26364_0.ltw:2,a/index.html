I haven't measure how long it takes to happen, but it tends to be 'after a
while'. This is the first time I've realised it stops after several more
hours, which was a surprise. I'm trying to measure how long it takes now.

Is there a way to figure out what's getting processed when this happens?

I'm currently running the process with both of QJackCtl's d-bus boxes
unticked to see if (and when) it happens again. PulseAudio isn't installed
and I didn't have my ALSA bridge running when recording the video, but I
won't start it today anyway just in case it would make a difference. No
process spike yet...

&gt;&gt; I'm having a problem with the jackdbus process; after some hours it
&gt;&gt; starts maxing out two of my four CPU cores, which in turn causes xruns when
&gt;&gt; running apps. It looks like other people have found the same problem, but
&gt;&gt; no solutions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I could well be wrong; but my suspicion is not on audio threads - but
&gt; rather management threads for things like DBus integration, or other "non
&gt; realtime" operations. If it was the audio thread that was causing the
&gt; deadlock and spinning, you would hear *no* audio at all.
&gt;
&gt; So next steps I'd suggest running without any extra features (disable Dbus
&gt; support, or Pulseaudio integration, or ALSA loopback devices, or anything
&gt; else that's not "core" JACK). See if it still happens..
&gt;
&gt; Good luck! -Harry
