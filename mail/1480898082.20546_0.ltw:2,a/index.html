It happens without dbus support (although it is still jackdbus installed).

This time it lasted between 6 hours and 6 hours 30 minutes, and the video
shows between 6 hours 12 minutes and 6 hours 13 minutes, so I'm guessing
it's about the same duration each time before it spikes, but I'd need to
verify this to be sure.

I guess I'll try the jack2 package instead. Any ideas on where I should
report this bug?

&gt; I haven't measure how long it takes to happen, but it tends to be 'after a
&gt; while'. This is the first time I've realised it stops after several more
&gt; hours, which was a surprise. I'm trying to measure how long it takes now.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a way to figure out what's getting processed when this happens?
&gt;
&gt; I'm currently running the process with both of QJackCtl's d-bus boxes
&gt; unticked to see if (and when) it happens again. PulseAudio isn't installed
&gt; and I didn't have my ALSA bridge running when recording the video, but I
&gt; won't start it today anyway just in case it would make a difference. No
&gt; process spike yet...

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm having a problem with the jackdbus process; after some hours it
&gt;&gt;&gt; starts maxing out two of my four CPU cores, which in turn causes xruns when
&gt;&gt;&gt; running apps. It looks like other people have found the same problem, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; no solutions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I could well be wrong; but my suspicion is not on audio threads - but
&gt;&gt; rather management threads for things like DBus integration, or other "non
&gt;&gt; realtime" operations. If it was the audio thread that was causing the
&gt;&gt; deadlock and spinning, you would hear *no* audio at all.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So next steps I'd suggest running without any extra features (disable
&gt;&gt; Dbus support, or Pulseaudio integration, or ALSA loopback devices, or
&gt;&gt; anything else that's not "core" JACK). See if it still happens..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good luck! -Harry
