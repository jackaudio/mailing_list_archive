https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aypje2qZPxs - here's a YouTube version of
the original video, maybe that will work better.

It does seem to be consistently 6 hours and 13 minutes before the process
spike, even when the sample rate is changed from 96 kHz to 192 kHz.

I think the spike is happening in the realtime threads (see
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2eROo5JatB4am00R2NsS3R6bVk for a
low-contrast screenshot of top), so I'm going to try running Jack with
realtime disabled this time.

&gt; &gt; Le 5 d&#xE9;c. 2016 &#xE0; 01:34, Thomas Howe &lt;[hidden]&gt; a &#xE9;crit :
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It happens without dbus support (although it is still jackdbus
&gt; installed).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This time it lasted between 6 hours and 6 hours 30 minutes, and the
&gt; video shows between 6 hours 12 minutes and 6 hours 13 minutes, so I'm
&gt; guessing it's about the same duration each time before it spikes, but I'd
&gt; need to verify this to be sure.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I guess I'll try the jack2 package instead. Any ideas on where I should
&gt; report this bug?

&gt; &gt; I haven't measure how long it takes to happen, but it tends to be 'after

&gt; hours, which was a surprise. I'm trying to measure how long it takes now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there a way to figure out what's getting processed when this happens?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm currently running the process with both of QJackCtl's d-bus boxes
&gt; unticked to see if (and when) it happens again. PulseAudio isn't installed
&gt; and I didn't have my ALSA bridge running when recording the video, but I
&gt; won't start it today anyway just in case it would make a difference. No
&gt; process spike yet...

&gt; &gt; I'm having a problem with the jackdbus process; after some hours it
&gt; starts maxing out two of my four CPU cores, which in turn causes xruns when

&gt; no solutions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I could well be wrong; but my suspicion is not on audio threads - but
&gt; rather management threads for things like DBus integration, or other "non
&gt; realtime" operations. If it was the audio thread that was causing the
&gt; deadlock and spinning, you would hear *no* audio at all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So next steps I'd suggest running without any extra features (disable
&gt; Dbus support, or Pulseaudio integration, or ALSA loopback devices, or
&gt; anything else that's not "core" JACK). See if it still happens..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good luck! -Harry
