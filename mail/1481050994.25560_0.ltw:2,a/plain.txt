Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jackdbus process eats two CPU cores for hours on end

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aypje2qZPxs - here's a YouTube version of
the original video, maybe that will work better.

It does seem to be consistently 6 hours and 13 minutes before the process
spike, even when the sample rate is changed from 96 kHz to 192 kHz.

I think the spike is happening in the realtime threads (see
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2eROo5JatB4am00R2NsS3R6bVk for a
low-contrast screenshot of top), so I'm going to try running Jack with
realtime disabled this time.
