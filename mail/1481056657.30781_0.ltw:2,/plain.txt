Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jackdbus process eats two CPU cores for hours on end

You could run "perf record" during the time jack consumes a lot of
resources. That way we may get samples of where it spends the most time.
You may need to rebuild jack to include debug symbols so function names
can be seen.

This may at least give a hint on where things are going wrong.
