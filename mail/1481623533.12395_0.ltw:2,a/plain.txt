Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jack_get_sample_rate

(Added jack-devel mailing list again)

Yes, I would think that jack_get_sample_rate is the only way to know the
sample rate.

If qjackctl shows different information it must be a bug in qjackctl.
However, I noticed that your jack version is 7 years old. If qjackctl
displayed
the wrong information in 2009, it's probably been fixed now.
