Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] jackdbus process eats two CPU cores for hours on end

Okay, it seems that it only happens when MIDI is set to 'raw' (not 'seq'),
and the selected device is my Scarlett 2i4, so I'll just switch MIDI
driver. I'll probably do more testing at some point.

Thanks for the guidance, I doubt I would've isolated the problem without it
:)
