From my understanding:
- event_reserve() takes "size" number of bytes from JACKs internal MIDI
buffers for a particular port, and returns the address to that buffer. Your
application can now write to that pointer, and once the RT callback is
done, JACK will transmit the data.

- event_write() takes a pointer from your application, and copies the data
pointed to into the JACK internal midi buffer. Your application can re-use
or delete the buffer you passed to the event_write() function now, as JACK
has a copy of the data.

See above.

In short: Yes. You need to transfer the MIDI data to be sent between two
threads - this can be trivial with mutexs/semaphors/locking systems, but
keep in mind that your real-time thread must *never* block. Personally, I
am a big proponent of message passing, instead of locking based systems.

To answer your question, I would use a ringbuffer (jack has a ringbuffer t)
to move a message (struct with some metadata) to transfer an event (midi
note one) between the GUI to JACK thread.

Hope that helps, -Harry
