Maybe I'm using the wrong terms. I mean it has its own Jack client
'Firefox' whenever it runs, unlike programs like Flash which rely on
ALSA/PulseAudio, so it's Jack-aware. Firefox seems to lack features that
would let me establish a persistent connection between its Jack client and
another Jack client, which would generally be expected of a Jack-aware
program, so that's why I used "partially Jack-aware".

&gt; A loopback Jack client to intercept streams to and from partially
&gt; Jack-aware programs such as SMPlayer and Firefox would be useful. Both of
&gt; these programs output audio to Jack, but only to the system ports, which
&gt; makes routing the audio inconvinient.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; When you call Firefox "partially Jack-aware", what do you mean? I can only
&gt; get firefox to output to the default system audio; I can set that to Jack,
&gt; but neither Firefox nor flash do anything special when playing videos / ogg
&gt; files / etc.
