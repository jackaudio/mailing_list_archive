Firefox seems to lack features that would let me establish a persistent connection between its Jack client and another Jack client, which would generally be expected of a Jack-aware program, so that's why I used "partially Jack-aware".

Hmm?

First, you're talking about Jack/Firefox on Linux; I'm talking about Jack/Firefox on MacOS.

With that said, any program that talks to Jack through the default audio out (10.9.5, when this was still possible) shows up as the program name. In the case of firefox, I will see Firefox or plugin-container, depending on firefox native or flash.

But this is just using the normal audio out system on Macs; this is the same system that fails on 10.10 or later (as I understand it, only programs that let you explicitly select an audio device can talk to Jack on those OS's; since Firefox/flash, as well as most games and other programs, only talk to the default audio device, none of them can use Jack on newer Mac OS's.)
