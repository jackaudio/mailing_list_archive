ALSA's 'jack' plugin can route audio from an ALSA-aware app to
jack. You can specify to which jack ports it should connect.

You need the alsa-plugins package and an .asoundrc file in your
home directory. This works by making the jack plugin the default
ALSA device. In the example below it will connect to zita-mu1 for
output. I'm using this with Opera, works perfectly.

Example .asoundrc:

---
pcm.!default {
    type plug
    slave { pcm "jack" }
}

pcm.jack {
    type jack
    playback_ports {
       0 zita-mu1:in_2.L
       1 zita-mu1:in_2.R
    }
    capture_ports {
        0 system:capture_1
        1 system:capture_2
    }
}
