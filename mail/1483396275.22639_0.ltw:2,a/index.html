Ok, I tried it, and as I assumed it had no effect apart from stopping
SMPlayer playing through ALSA at all. I'm guessing this is a glitch in
SMPlayer, because MuseScore plays fine through ALSA and makes the ALSA-Jack
client appear. This solution still seems functionally identical to my ALSA
loopback setup - most things work fine but Firefox still creates a
"Firefox" Jack client and outputs through that instead of the default ALSA
device.

Also, this deviates from the point I was trying to make in the first email
- Jack's system ports can't currently be hidden from programs, and it would
be useful if they could.

&gt; &gt; Here's my asound.conf. I don't have the plugin, but shouldn't the ALSA
&gt; &gt; loopback configuration have the same effect and instruct Firefox to
&gt; output
&gt; &gt; to the loopback device instead of outputting as a Jack client?
&gt;
&gt; If you don't have the plugin then just get it from your distro.
&gt;
&gt; I posted a solution to your problem, one which actually works
&gt; since I've been using this for the last five years or so.

&gt; You respond by posting something that starts by saying that
&gt; you don't understand it.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not going to waste any more time on this.
