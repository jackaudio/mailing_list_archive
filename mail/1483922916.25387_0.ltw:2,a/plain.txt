I would guess that the samplerate is not matching the actual - either in
the OSS backend, or in the recorded materials settings. Given that jack_rec
records fine on Linux, I would guess that OSS backend isn't acquiring 48000
Hz sampling rate, but falling back to 44100 silently.

Then playing the content back (with jack_rec recording as if it was 48000,
and hence writing that as a .wav header ) would result in high pitched
playback..

Unfortunatly I don't have a FreeBSD machine here to test - but look into
the sampling rates, and test 44100 to see if that works as expected.

Hope that helps, -Harry
