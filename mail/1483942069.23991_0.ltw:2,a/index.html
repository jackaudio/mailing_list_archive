&gt; What is wrong? How to fix?

I found what's happening: pretty much what Harry van Haaren described it 
in his reply.

My OSS device with the mike doesn't accept 48000. During 
sysctl(SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED) it always falls back to 32000. Jack fails to 
process this properly and records the signal with the wrong pitch. If 
the requested speed is &gt;32000 the pitch it is recording is higher, and 
for requested speeds &lt;32000 the pitch is too low. It only records fine 
with the speed 32000.

Bug#1: Jack shouldn't create recordings with invalid speed, so this is a 
bug in Jack.


Bug#2: The other DSP device also falls back, but to another speed: 
48000. So they are always different. Ardour5 app fails to work with Jack 
in such conditions - sound is always distorted. Depending on how it is 
supposed to be in such situation, this is either a bug in Jack, or in 
Ardour. But Ardour assumes all speeds are the same during one session, 
so Jack probably shoud disallow mismatching speeds.


One more thing: turning off SNDCTL_DSP_COOKEDMODE cures the situation 
completely (probably with the quality tradeoff). Driver converts speeds 
to the requested ones. Jack should 1) have an option to turn COOKEDMODE 
off, and 2) recommend such option as a workaround when read/write speeds 
are different, so that it can be used at all with the low quality audio 
hardware (purely as a workaround mode).
