I looked back at your first email and you never showed the entire output
from jackd as it starts.  The console messages printed should display the
determined paramaters.  On ALSA systems there is a message showing what
sample rate is used if it is not the same as the sample rate requested. 
Maybe OSS does not return that information.  That would be a limitation of
OSS or maybe an error in the jackd OSS driver, not a generic jackd
problem.  I have never heard of anyone using the OSS driver, how many
users of that are there?
