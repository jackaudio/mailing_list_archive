I'm very interested in Yuri's results as I'd like to use JACK under
FreeBSD. Supposedly (theoretically) both Ardour 5 and MusE 3 git should be
able to run under FreeBSD these days.

Anyone using JACK under BSD is dependent upon JACK's OSS driver but last
time I tried JACK under a FBSD 11 pre-release it failed to start at all. I
haven't tried it since 11-RELEASE.

&gt; I looked back at your first email and you never showed the entire output
&gt; from jackd as it starts.  The console messages printed should display the
&gt; determined paramaters.  On ALSA systems there is a message showing what
&gt; sample rate is used if it is not the same as the sample rate requested.
&gt; Maybe OSS does not return that information.  That would be a limitation of
&gt; OSS or maybe an error in the jackd OSS driver, not a generic jackd
&gt; problem.  I have never heard of anyone using the OSS driver, how many
&gt; users of that are there?
