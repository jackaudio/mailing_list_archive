Back in the days, the consensus was "We're already overloaded with
making ALSA work, OSS has exactly zero priority". There was even talk to
delete the OSS code entirely.

I vaguely recall that folks were using jackd2 instead, but maybe I'm
making this up.

What I'm trying to say here is: to the best of my knowledge, there's
nobody on the jack team who cares about OSS, at least not in the context
of jackd1. You're most likely on your own.

I agree that this is potentially a shortcoming in jackd's OSS driver, so
whoever needs this is invited to send in a patch. Don't expect any of
the existing jackd devs to fix it for you, this is simply unrealistic.
