&gt; FYI:
&gt;
&gt; The "speed" integer is updated to the actual rate when the 
&gt; SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED IOCTL returns. I think this behaviour is the 
&gt; expected. Jackd should use this returned rate. An alternative would be 
&gt; to use FreeBSD's virtual_oss to wrap the DSP device.
&gt;
&gt; --HPS 

Yes, so Jack should use the adjusted value as an actual value. It should 
also decide what does it do when the adjusted values for input and 
output are different. It should probably fail and have the way to work 
around, to disable SNDCTL_DSP_COOKEDMODE. It should provide and suggest 
the option to prevent the COOKEDMODE.

&gt; Maybe OSS does not return that information.  That would be a limitation of
&gt; OSS or maybe an error in the jackd OSS driver, not a generic jackd
&gt; problem.  I have never heard of anyone using the OSS driver, how many
&gt; users of that are there?


FreeBSD uses OSS. When people try using Jack the often fail. So I am 
trying to figure out what is wrong.

&gt;
&gt; Anyone using JACK under BSD is dependent upon JACK's OSS driver but 
&gt; last time I tried JACK under a FBSD 11 pre-release it failed to start 
&gt; at all. I haven't tried it since 11-RELEASE.

With the rc script 
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=215889 it is easy to 
start. The other possible problems are the speed adjustment this thread 
is about, and the realtime priority the other thread is about (-r avoids 
it).
