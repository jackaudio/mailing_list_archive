Yes, so Jack should use the adjusted value as an actual value. It should 
also decide what does it do when the adjusted values for input and 
output are different. It should probably fail and have the way to work 
around, to disable SNDCTL_DSP_COOKEDMODE. It should provide and suggest 
the option to prevent the COOKEDMODE.

FreeBSD uses OSS. When people try using Jack the often fail. So I am 
trying to figure out what is wrong.

With the rc script 
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=215889 it is easy to 
start. The other possible problems are the speed adjustment this thread 
is about, and the realtime priority the other thread is about (-r avoids 
it).
