On Linux, it's 1 .. 99.

On Linux, higher is definitely better:

   "Processes with numerically higher priority values are scheduled
    before processes  with  numerically  lower  priority  values."

Please send a patch or ideally a pull request on github. It's easier to
discuss.

You can always run without realtime priorities (-r or --no-realtime).


I'm surprised FreeBSD doesn't use PAM to allow users to call SCHED_FIFO.
You're sure about this?
