I'm using jack1 almost every week with FreeBSD and OSS. I would happily 
be glad to contribute a better OSS experience with FreeBSD, where OSS is 
the de-facto audio standard. Maybe you could give some FreeBSD devs a 
few src bits for jack1? The FreeBSD team has a bunch of OSS patches 
already waiting for upstream:
