Subject:     [Jack-Devel] strange valgrind results for client initialization and shutdown

Hi list,

i have recently started to play with valgrind and for yet unknown reasons
i get a lot of "Syscall param write(buf) points to uninitialised byte(s)"
even for a simple program like this:

#include <jack/jack.h>
int main()
{
	const char *name="test";
	jack_client_t *client;
	jack_options_t options=JackNoStartServer;
	jack_status_t status;
	client=jack_client_open(name,options,&status);
	jack_client_close(client);
	return 0;
}

//gcc -o test test.c -ljack
//valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes -v
./test

Is there anything missing in the code example?
Should i worry about the errors shown by valgrind (in that case 10 errors
from 6 contexts) at all?

Thanks for your suggestions.
Thomas
