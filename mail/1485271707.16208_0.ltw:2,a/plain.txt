yes i think that works pretty good (drawing from earlier experiments).
Using S/PDIF just for sync is a cheap alternative to a "real" wordclock.
One of both interfaces will be slaved to the other and then both should
run the same cycle at the same time (so theoretically no phasing issues).
You just have to manage to shove forth and back the sample data from/to
interface at good enough rate which isn't a particular problem on
localhost using UDP like zita does. If there is no resampling involved,
this can work for many many channels without hitting the CPU too much.
