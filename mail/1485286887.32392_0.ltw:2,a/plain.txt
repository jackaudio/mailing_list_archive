This is all as wrong as it can possibly be.

First, even when resampling is disabled there is no defined relation
between the period timing of Jack's main soundcard and the one added
with zita-ajbridge. Zita-ajbridge will detect the relative period 
phases, and insert buffering so as to ensure that the difference in
latency is always the same.

Second, there is no UDP or anything network involved at all.
