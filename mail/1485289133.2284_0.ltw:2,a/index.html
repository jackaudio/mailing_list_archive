&gt;&gt; One of both interfaces will be slaved to the other and then both should
&gt;&gt;  run the same cycle at the same time (so theoretically no phasing
&gt;&gt; issues). You just have to manage to shove forth and back the sample data
&gt;&gt; from/to interface at good enough rate which isn't a particular problem
&gt;&gt; on localhost using UDP like zita does. If there is no resampling
&gt;&gt; involved, this can work for many many channels without hitting the CPU
&gt;&gt; too much.
&gt;
&gt; This is all as wrong as it can possibly be.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; First, even when resampling is disabled there is no defined relation
&gt; between the period timing of Jack's main soundcard and the one added with
&gt; zita-ajbridge. Zita-ajbridge will detect the relative period phases, and
&gt; insert buffering so as to ensure that the difference in latency is always
&gt; the same.
&gt;
&gt; Second, there is no UDP or anything network involved at all.
&gt;

I wrongly mixed this up with zita-n2j/j2n while its about zita-a2j/j2a,
sorry for that.
