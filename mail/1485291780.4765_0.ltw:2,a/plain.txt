I tried to go over them recently. Wherever trivial and correct, I've
merged them.

With others, I failed to understand all the implications and hence
didn't feel comfortable merging them, especially since I've lost touch
with the codebase over the last years.

And then there's this whole category of OSX. I don't know what the
situation there is, but it seems that Sierra changed the device API and
jack no longer works? Or maybe I'm reading this wrong?

Let me CC sletz for his view. I haven't seen him lately neither, maybe
also swamped with work.

That said, if you want to provide code reviews on the PRs, please go
ahead and mark those that look good to you. Then re-assign to me, and
I'll merge them in. The more eyes the merrier. 


Cheers
