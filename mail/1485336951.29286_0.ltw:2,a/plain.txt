IIRC the idea as that both jack1 and jack2 (or better: all jack implementations)
share the same header.

I think that that "public" jack header would only contain declarations for 
jack's public API, and that should be the same for all implementations since
the idea is that any application should be able to interact with any implementation.
So that API would also be an ABI.
