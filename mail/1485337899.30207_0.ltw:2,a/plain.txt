??? That sounds strange. I can't comment on the windows situation but on 
MacOS and Linux 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update' work perfectly 
fine (and I can't imagine this would'nt work on Windows).

That's the worst of all solitions. While the git-submodule solution give us
clearly defined dependencies under version control, that solution depends on
some poor maintainer (actually, one for each implementation) keeping the 
header files in sync. 
From the last vew post I didn't get the impression that there's a huge crowd of
jack maintainers ;-)

I'd really like to know in what ways ....
