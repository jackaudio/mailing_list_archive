A very quick search through the source files suggests that there are 2 
such structs in the public header file (jack/types.h) - namely:-

       _jack_latency_range
       _jack_position

Whoever's doing the merge will need to be aware that the above structs 
require 1-byte alignment in Jack2 which is probably different from their 
alignment in Jack1 (assuming they're also present in Jack1).

For some background...  the above structs (plus several others) 
originally used the more conventional, 8-byte alignment.  But it turned 
out that gcc and msvc couldn't agree on what constituted 8-byte 
alignment.  This meant that a Jack2 client built with msvc would crash 
if the server was built with gcc (or vice versa).  This got fixed by 
changing the alignment to 1-byte.
