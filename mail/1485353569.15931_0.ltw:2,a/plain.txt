Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Cannot combine audio devices with more than 64 channels

That would be a problem. We want to use these cards for wave field
synthesis. They can have WordClock connections, so they are precisely
synced. If jack would somehow add latency to the second card, the results
won't work.
