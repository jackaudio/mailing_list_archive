&gt; Let me CC sletz for his view. I haven't seen him lately neither, maybe
&gt; also swamped with work.
&gt;
&gt; That said, if you want to provide code reviews on the PRs, please go
&gt; ahead and mark those that look good to you. Then re-assign to me, and I'll
&gt; merge them in. The more eyes the merrier.

I don't think i could do that in a nice way for pull requests since i've
only a very rough insight in JACK 2's code base.

However i could possibly help to categorize issues by labels.
Please have a look at this example:
https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio/issues
I think it makes great use of labels to get a quick overview if an issue
is a bug or a feature or related to OSX etc. The first step would be to
define a set of labels.

What is the general opinion, would that help in any ways? Could it help to
plan releases too (using milestones)?

Greetings
Thomas
