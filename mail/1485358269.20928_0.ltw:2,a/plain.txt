I don't think i could do that in a nice way for pull requests since i've
only a very rough insight in JACK 2's code base.

However i could possibly help to categorize issues by labels.
Please have a look at this example:
https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio/issues
I think it makes great use of labels to get a quick overview if an issue
is a bug or a feature or related to OSX etc. The first step would be to
define a set of labels.

What is the general opinion, would that help in any ways? Could it help to
plan releases too (using milestones)?

Thomas
