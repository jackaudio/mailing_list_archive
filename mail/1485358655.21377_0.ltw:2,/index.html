Not much time for JACK2 right now. Merging big PR is almost impossible if they affect common code and cannot be tested on OS X and Windows. PR that deal with limited/easy to review changes or Linux/ALSA specific ones can possibly be merged. PR review is a good idea, but I would prefer to keep an eye on final merge... 

The reasonable goal for me will be to finally do a official jackdmp 1.9.1 release, hopefully in february.

&gt;&gt; And then there's this whole category of OSX. I don't know what the

&gt;&gt; jack no longer works? Or maybe I'm reading this wrong?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Let me CC sletz for his view. I haven't seen him lately neither, maybe
&gt;&gt; also swamped with work.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That said, if you want to provide code reviews on the PRs, please go
&gt;&gt; ahead and mark those that look good to you. Then re-assign to me, and I'll
&gt;&gt; merge them in. The more eyes the merrier.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think i could do that in a nice way for pull requests since i've
&gt; only a very rough insight in JACK 2's code base.
&gt; 
&gt; However i could possibly help to categorize issues by labels.
&gt; Please have a look at this example:
&gt; https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio/issues
&gt; I think it makes great use of labels to get a quick overview if an issue
&gt; is a bug or a feature or related to OSX etc. The first step would be to
&gt; define a set of labels.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the general opinion, would that help in any ways? Could it help to
&gt; plan releases too (using milestones)?
&gt;
