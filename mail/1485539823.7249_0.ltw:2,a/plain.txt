JJack is a dead project - you'd have to compile the native libs
specifically for ARM, and it uses some deprecated functionality.  I'm
not sure it ever supported MIDI either?

Check out JNAJack, which should work OK on Raspbian, although I
haven't tested it.

https://github.com/jaudiolibs/jnajack

There's a binary JAR under releases.  You'll also need JNA -

There are examples of usage for JNAJack, including a MIDI example, at

https://github.com/jaudiolibs/examples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/jaudiolibs/examples

Best wishes,

Neil
