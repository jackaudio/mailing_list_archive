Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Cannot combine audio devices with more than 64 channels

So the bug has been fixed on the alsa-side. However, when I start jack via:

wfs@wfs16:~$ jackd -p 1024 -d alsa -C madifx_record_all -P madifx_playback_all

The corresponding cpp-file at that line compares against a variable
called "DRIVER_PORT_NUM", which is a constant defined in
"common/JackConstants.h" on line 53 on the github repo. Could that be
the problem?
