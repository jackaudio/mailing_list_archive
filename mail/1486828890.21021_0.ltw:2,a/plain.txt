Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Cannot combine audio devices with more than 64 channels

> Is there some guide to compile jackd2 from source? Here is what I did:

 From an old e-mail:

http://jack-audio.10948.n7.nabble.com/Jack-Devel-same-jack-version-but-different-protocol-versions-revisited-tp18330p18339.html

   # apt-get build-dep jackd2
   # apt-get install git-buildpackage devscripts pristine-tar
   $ git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/pkg-multimedia/jackd2.git
   $ git checkout upstream
   $ git checkout pristine-tar
   $ git checkout master
   $ git-buildpackage -uc -us

In the meantime, git-buildpackage got renamed to "gbp buildpackage", but
otherwise this should be it.

That's a Debian build error, not a jackd2 compilation error. If the
above commands don't work, simply follow John's procedure for now.
