Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack 2 download for Windows not available

Hello!
I am a fan of Jack and would like to install it in my Windows computer for
routing audio from Serato DJ to a compressor vst and back again to Serato.
However, the download for installing Jack 2 on Windows is not available on
the download page.
File not found
Sorry, that file doesnâ€™t live here anymore. It might have been moved or
made private.
This message is displayed from dropbox. Is there any chance I could have
access to the download any other way?

Thanks a bunch!
Pablo Andrade
