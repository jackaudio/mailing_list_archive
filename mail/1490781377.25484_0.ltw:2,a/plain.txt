Doesn't anyone have write access to the web server?
I can upload the binaries to the Notam web server, if
finding a place to host the files is the problem
(although I guess it isn't).

And it would also be good to make 1.9.11 the official release for Windows,
since most of the qjackctl problems on Windows is fixed there.
That's probably the biggest problem with Jack on Windows.
I've used 1.9.11 since it was released, and I've also included it with
Radium, so it has probably been tested enough now.
