I just created release tags for Windows and OSX on the jackaudio.org
GitHub repository to host the binaries and will update the download page
accordingly later with a notification so changes can be pushed to the
webserver.

I didn't want to take this matter in my own hands since there have been
better solutions suggested and it bothers me a bit to complicate the
whole release process even more by doing that.

Anyway here are the binaries obtained from archive.org:
https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/releases

Greetings
Markus

&gt; I can upload the binaries to the Notam web server, if
&gt; finding a place to host the files is the problem
&gt; (although I guess it isn't).
&gt;
&gt; And it would also be good to make 1.9.11 the official release for Windows,
&gt; since most of the qjackctl problems on Windows is fixed there.
&gt; That's probably the biggest problem with Jack on Windows.
&gt; I've used 1.9.11 since it was released, and I've also included it with
&gt; Radium, so it has probably been tested enough now.

&gt;&gt; Fullquote below for context. I don't know anything about Windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. Sorry to bother you, I'm not even sure if you're the one I would
&gt;&gt;&gt; talk to about this, but on the JACK
&gt;&gt;&gt; website, http://jackaudio.org/downloads/, the WIN download links don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; exist.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thought I'd bring this to your attention. I would really love to use
&gt;&gt;&gt; this software.
