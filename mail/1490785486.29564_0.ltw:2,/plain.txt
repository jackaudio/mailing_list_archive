Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack Audio WIN link

I just created release tags for Windows and OSX on the jackaudio.org
GitHub repository to host the binaries and will update the download page
accordingly later with a notification so changes can be pushed to the
webserver.

I didn't want to take this matter in my own hands since there have been
better solutions suggested and it bothers me a bit to complicate the
whole release process even more by doing that.

Anyway here are the binaries obtained from archive.org:
https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/releases

Greetings
Markus
