Hi,
i have an odd feeling that nobody feels responsible. This is not good for
JACK!
It feels good however to see that users help each other but it would be
better if somebody takes control. For the site, this is supposed to be
Markus Seeber. For the source code and releases it's less obvious. I hope
this will be sorted out!
Best regards
Thomas
