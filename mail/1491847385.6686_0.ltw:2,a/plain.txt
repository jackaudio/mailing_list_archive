Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Most download links are down on jackaudio.org

Hey!

I've found out that most download links on this page are dead:
http://www.jackaudio.org/downloads/

They seem to lead to Dropbox, but only a 404 page is shown.

Some links are ok, and these seem to be hosted on the jackaudio.org itself.
