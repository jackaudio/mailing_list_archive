Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Failures in connecting mac OSX Sierra and an embedded board with linux via netjack2

Hi all,
I have issues when trying to connect via netjack2 an odroid embedded board
(with linux debian, real time kernel) and a new macbookpro 2016 with OSX
Sierra 10.12.4.

My goal is to send audio from the odroid board (master) to the mac (slave)
using a direct ethernet connection. Basically I want to test the simple
case of playing a file from the board and listen to the result on the
loudspekers of the mac.

I verified that multicasting is enabled on both the board and the mac. From
the mac I connect to the board via SSH. I have set static Ip addresses on
both the board and the mac.

I am using the latest version of jack2 (jackdmp 1.9.11). Notably, I have
not compiled jack2 with dbus as I am running jack headless (following the
advise found on http://jrigg.co.uk/linuxaudio/jack2debian7.html).


To implement the netjack2 connection I followed the instructions on the
jack audio website
https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/WalkThrough_User_NetJack2.
The result is that the slave keep waiting for a master.

These are the outputs I get:


On the master:
/usr/bin/jackd -P 70 -p96 -t 2000 -dalsa -dhw:CODEC -S -s -r48000 -p128 -n2

Any advise?

Actually, if can be of any help, I also tried to set the mac as master and
the linux board as the slave. The result is that they seem to communicate,
although jack on the mac crashes giving the error "Floating point
exception: 8":

Notably the result of jack_lsp on the slave is:

It seams that there is a problem with the MIDI ports but I really can't
understand how to solve this.





Thanks in advance


Cheers
