The jackd master is the device with the audio hardware.  Are your problems
perhaps caused because you are following the setup instructions for master
on a device with no audio hardware? (saw later on that you tried the other
way around, so let's concentrate on that configuration).

That is on the odroid?  What ALSA compatible hardware is on the odroid?

In any event, the short of it is that ALSA is the driver for the audio
hardware, so whichever device has speakers connected better be the device
where you are giving the driver argument as "-dalsa" or you won't hear any
sound.

That should be the correct configuration if you want to connect the mac to
an amplifier and speakers and you want the linux odroid system to just
send digital audio information to the mac and have the mac play the audio.

Can you run local jack aware software on the mac and play audio through
the mac audio hardware?  Make sure you can get that working first before
trying to bring networking into it.

If you aren't going to use "Built-in Microphone" as an input device, you
could start with playback only.  That should get rid of the "input and
output devices are not the same !!" warning.   I think that would be -P
passed the coreaudio driver parameters, or maybe -Cno -Pyes, the manual
page is a little vaguely
worded and I don't have a machine with coreaudio to play with to try it out.

That is assuming you want to use the built in audio for the output,
otherwise the wrong device is selected and you need to sort that out
first.

This is a modern mac with Intel processor?  Just making sure.  I don't
have a mac myself, but just in case someone else can help, which OS
version?

This is the default multicast address reported by the master:

But you specified a unicast address in the place where you would usually
specify a multicast address different than default:

From the walk-through you linked:
Parameters for driver 'net' (all parameters are optional):
        -a, --multicast_ip      Multicast Address (default: 225.3.19.154)

You are giving a unicast address as the argument for the multicast address
to use.  Why did you think you needed to do that?
It seems the unicast address was ignored, because there is a message later
showing connected to macbook.

That looks like the net backend driver is trying to register MIDI  ports
for some reason, but the documentation says the default is no MIDI ports.
From the walk-through page "The default configuration is a simple stereo
use, with no midi port."  Maybe one of the jack2 devs can comment on
whether the behavior and documentation have diverged.

If you do get rid of the internal microphone as an input port, you should
probably set the net backend to not expect any input ports.   I think that
would be adding -C 0 -P 2 to the arguments after -dnet.
I guess for good measure you could add -i 0 -o 0 to specify 0 MIDI in and
out ports, although that is supposed to be the default.
