Dear Chris,
thanks a lot for your prompt reply,

Actually, my goal is that of sending audio from the board to other
connected devices, for the moment I am using a mac, it could be another pc
with linux or windows.
I am going for a wired connection first, with the final aim to test
netjack2 over wifi, and compare the wired and wireless behaviours under
various conditions.

The odroid board (configured as master in the first case) has a beheringer
soundcard perfectly working, I can record and listen audio using it. So I
should be able to use the odroid + soundcard configuration as a master, and
the mac as a slave. Right?

yes

Ok, but my goal is to have a networked configuration where the linux odroid
system broadcast
audio to various connected devices. My understanding is that the odroid
must be the master and
all the other devices receiving and reproducing the audio signal must be
the slave. Am I wrong?

Of course, I successfully used jack2 on the mac, it perfectly works (for
instance with Audacity or Max/MSP 7).

Ok I will try tomorrow and report to you. At the moment yes the mac's built
in audio for the output  is what I want to test.

Yes, I am using the very last macbook pro, with the very last and updated
OS X (version 10.12.4).

I don't have the setup right now, I will re-test tomorrow, but if I
correctly remember, I used the address 192.168.117.129
(which is the static address I gave to the mac) because simply using  jackd
-R -d net (which takes the default) did not work.

Yes it would be great if any jack developer could comment on this. I am
available to contribute to the jack community
by doing some tests on the mac if needed.

However, this is not the main goal I want to pursue, as I want to send
audio from the linux odroid board.
Any further insight on this?
