Hi all,
so I did the test suggested by Chris and still I am in troubles. Here the
outputs


Master: (mac OSX Sierra 10.12.4)

As you can see the issue of the MIDI ports is still there, despite I gave
the options -i 0 -o 0.
More interesting is this part of the master's jackd output:

Any suggestion?


And... any insights regarding the more general questions I posed in the
previous e-mail?


Thanks in advance

Cheers

&gt;&gt; &gt; My goal is to send audio from the odroid board (master)
&gt;&gt; &gt; to the mac (slave) using a direct ethernet connection.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The jackd master is the device with the audio hardware.  Are your problems
&gt;&gt; perhaps caused because you are following the setup instructions for master
&gt;&gt; on a device with no audio hardware? (saw later on that you tried the other
&gt;&gt; way around, so let's concentrate on that configuration).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Actually, my goal is that of sending audio from the board to other
&gt; connected devices, for the moment I am using a mac, it could be another pc
&gt; with linux or windows.
&gt; I am going for a wired connection first, with the final aim to test
&gt; netjack2 over wifi, and compare the wired and wireless behaviours under
&gt; various conditions.
&gt;
&gt; The odroid board (configured as master in the first case) has a beheringer
&gt; soundcard perfectly working, I can record and listen audio using it. So I
&gt; should be able to use the odroid + soundcard configuration as a master, and
&gt; the mac as a slave. Right?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; On the master:
&gt;&gt; &gt; /usr/bin/jackd -P 70 -p96 -t 2000 -dalsa -dhw:CODEC -S -s
&gt;&gt; &gt; -r48000 -p128 -n2
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; jack_load netmanager
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That is on the odroid?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; yes
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; What ALSA compatible hardware is on the odroid?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; U-CONTROL UCA222
&gt;
&gt; https://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-
&gt; Audio/Audio-Interfaces/UCA222/p/P0A31
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; In any event, the short of it is that ALSA is the driver for the audio
&gt;&gt; hardware, so whichever device has speakers connected better be the device
&gt;&gt; where you are giving the driver argument as "-dalsa" or you won't hear any
&gt;&gt; sound.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Actually, if can be of any help, I also tried to set the mac
&gt;&gt; &gt; as master and the linux board as the slave.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That should be the correct configuration if you want to connect the mac to
&gt;&gt; an amplifier and speakers and you want the linux odroid system to just
&gt;&gt; send digital audio information to the mac and have the mac play the audio.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Ok, but my goal is to have a networked configuration where the linux
&gt; odroid system broadcast
&gt; audio to various connected devices. My understanding is that the odroid
&gt; must be the master and
&gt; all the other devices receiving and reproducing the audio signal must be
&gt; the slave. Am I wrong?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  The result is that they seem to communicate,
&gt;&gt; &gt; although jack on the mac crashes giving the error
&gt;&gt; &gt; "Floating point exception: 8":
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you run local jack aware software on the mac and play audio through
&gt;&gt; the mac audio hardware?  Make sure you can get that working first before
&gt;&gt; trying to bring networking into it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Of course, I successfully used jack2 on the mac, it perfectly works (for
&gt; instance with Audacity or Max/MSP 7).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Default input and output devices are not the same !!
&gt;&gt; &gt; Cannot open default device in duplex mode, so aggregate
&gt;&gt; &gt; default input and default output
&gt;&gt; &gt; Separated input = 'Built-in Microphone'
&gt;&gt; &gt; Separated output = 'Built-in Output'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you aren't going to use "Built-in Microphone" as an input device, you
&gt;&gt; could start with playback only.  That should get rid of the "input and
&gt;&gt; output devices are not the same !!" warning.   I think that would be -P
&gt;&gt; passed the coreaudio driver parameters, or maybe -Cno -Pyes, the manual
&gt;&gt; page is a little vaguely
&gt;&gt; worded and I don't have a machine with coreaudio to play with to try it
&gt;&gt; out.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That is assuming you want to use the built in audio for the output,
&gt;&gt; otherwise the wrong device is selected and you need to sort that out
&gt;&gt; first.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ok I will try tomorrow and report to you. At the moment yes the mac's
&gt; built in audio for the output  is what I want to test.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Takes physical 2 audio output(s) for slave
&gt;&gt; &gt; Takes physical 0 MIDI input(s) for slave
&gt;&gt; &gt; Takes physical 0 MIDI output(s) for slave
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sending parameters to ...
&gt;&gt; &gt; Floating point exception: 8
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is a modern mac with Intel processor?  Just making sure.  I don't
&gt;&gt; have a mac myself, but just in case someone else can help, which OS
&gt;&gt; version?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I am using the very last macbook pro, with the very last and updated
&gt; OS X (version 10.12.4).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is the default multicast address reported by the master:
&gt;&gt; &gt; Starting Jack NetManager
&gt;&gt; &gt; Listening on '225.3.19.154:19000'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But you specified a unicast address in the place where you would usually
&gt;&gt; specify a multicast address different than default:
&gt;&gt; &gt; On the slave (linux board):
&gt;&gt; &gt; jackd -R -d net -a 192.168.117.129 -p 19000
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; From the walk-through you linked:
&gt;&gt; Parameters for driver 'net' (all parameters are optional):
&gt;&gt;         -a, --multicast_ip      Multicast Address (default: 225.3.19.154)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You are giving a unicast address as the argument for the multicast address
&gt;&gt; to use.  Why did you think you needed to do that?
&gt;&gt; It seems the unicast address was ignored, because there is a message later
&gt;&gt; showing connected to macbook.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don't have the setup right now, I will re-test tomorrow, but if I
&gt; correctly remember, I used the address 192.168.117.129
&gt; (which is the static address I gave to the mac) because simply using
&gt;  jackd -R -d net (which takes the default) did not work.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Maximum number of input ports is reached for application ref = 0
&gt;&gt; &gt; driver: cannot register port for system:midi_playback_769
&gt;&gt; &gt; Can't allocate ports.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Initing net driver fails...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That looks like the net backend driver is trying to register MIDI  ports
&gt;&gt; for some reason, but the documentation says the default is no MIDI ports.
&gt;&gt; From the walk-through page "The default configuration is a simple stereo
&gt;&gt; use, with no midi port."  Maybe one of the jack2 devs can comment on
&gt;&gt; whether the behavior and documentation have diverged.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes it would be great if any jack developer could comment on this. I am
&gt; available to contribute to the jack community
&gt; by doing some tests on the mac if needed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you do get rid of the internal microphone as an input port, you should
&gt;&gt; probably set the net backend to not expect any input ports.   I think that
&gt;&gt; would be adding -C 0 -P 2 to the arguments after -dnet.
&gt;&gt; I guess for good measure you could add -i 0 -o 0 to specify 0 MIDI in and
&gt;&gt; out ports, although that is supposed to be the default.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; I will try tomorrow and report.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; However, this is not the main goal I want to pursue, as I want to send
&gt; audio from the linux odroid board.
&gt; Any further insight on this?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
