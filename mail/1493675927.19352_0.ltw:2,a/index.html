I had some firewall configuration problems preventing successful multicast
packet exchange between my test machines, but I got that sorted out by
temporarily just disabling the firewall on one machine.

This is the output I see from each machine.

So it seems that contrary to the documentation netjack2 will create MIDI
channels by default, and at least on my system (where the interface does
support duplex mode) I can start netjack with no arguments and the default
behavior will successfully create a connection.

So I think at this point my guess is that the last output shown by the
original poster indicates some kind of mismatch between the jack ALSA
parameters and the allowed netjack parameters:
&gt;&gt; Can't set net buffer sizes : Invalid argument
&gt;&gt; SetParams error...
&gt;&gt; Can't init new NetMaster...

I thought maybe the buffer size was too large, but the original post was
using -p128 -n2, and at least on my machine I use -p1024 -n3 and that did
not have a problem.

But again, the last message from the original post did not show the
"configuring for..." output line from jackd, so either the jackd output
was truncated in the posting, removing information necessary to help
debug, or the ALSA backend did not actually start correctly.
