Dear Chris,
many thanks for all your info and suggestions. For the moment I want to
test netjack2, I will definitively try the zita bridge asap.

Regarding your questions, I have never truncated the commands outputs.


Firstly, the -Cno -Pyes commands remove the warning "Default input and
output devices are not the same !!", while having only -P does not.
I have specified the parameters for coreaudio. I did various trials, I
report the outputs below.

TRIAL 3----------------------------------------------------

On the master (Mac computer)

jack_load netmanager -i "-h" gives:

Internal client parameters:
-a, --multicast-ip Multicast address (default: 225.3.19.154)
-p, --udp-net-port UDP port (default: 19000)
-c, --auto-connect Auto connect netmaster to system ports (default: false)
-s, --auto-save Save/restore netmaster connection state when restarted
(default: false)


Therefore I typed: jack_load netmanager -i "-c true"
netmanager is running.
client name = netmanager

The result does not change....

TRIAL 4 ----------------------------------------------------


I used a different buffer size 1024 and with or without specifying the
maximum number of port of jackd

jackd -P 70  -t 2000 -dcoreaudio  -s -r48000 -p1024 -n2 -Cno -Pyes

jackd -P 70  -p96  -t 2000 -dcoreaudio  -s -r48000 -p1024 -n2 -Cno -Pyes


The result are the same of before.,...





TRIAL 5 ----------------------------------------------------

Notably if I just us:  jackd -R -d net  or  jackd -R -d net -a 225.3.19.154
-p 19000 or

the crashing error "Floating point exception: 8" arises, while it does not
specifying jackd -R -d net -a 225.3.19.154 -p 19000 -C 0 -P 2  (see TRIAL
6) :

Still the problems persists. I can't proceed... Any further suggestion to
make work the two jackified units?

&gt;
&gt; So it seems that contrary to the documentation netjack2 will create MIDI
&gt; channels by default, and at least on my system (where the interface does
&gt; support duplex mode) I can start netjack with no arguments and the default
&gt; behavior will successfully create a connection.
&gt;
&gt; So I think at this point my guess is that the last output shown by the
&gt; original poster indicates some kind of mismatch between the jack ALSA
&gt; parameters and the allowed netjack parameters:
&gt; &gt;&gt; Can't set net buffer sizes : Invalid argument
&gt; &gt;&gt; SetParams error...
&gt; &gt;&gt; Can't init new NetMaster...
&gt;
&gt; I thought maybe the buffer size was too large, but the original post was
&gt; using -p128 -n2, and at least on my machine I use -p1024 -n3 and that did
&gt; not have a problem.
&gt;
&gt; But again, the last message from the original post did not show the
&gt; "configuring for..." output line from jackd, so either the jackd output
&gt; was truncated in the posting, removing information necessary to help
&gt; debug, or the ALSA backend did not actually start correctly.
