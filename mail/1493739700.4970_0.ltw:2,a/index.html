Dear Chris,
many thanks. Yes we would really need some feedback from jack developers at
this point.

If someone can direct me towards some specific procedures to solve the
problem I would be grateful.

I have already verified that multicast is enabled on my mac (latest macbook
pro October 2016 with OS X Sierra 10.12.4),
both on wireless and ethernet (with adaptor...) ports.

Cheers

&gt; OK, maybe the coreaudio backend just doesn't dump out as much information
&gt; as the ALSA backend.  Just looks odd because on an ALSA machine you
&gt; usually get confirmation of what format and sample rate was set (sometimes
&gt; the hardware does not support what you requested, and the ALSA backend
&gt; will adjust to find the closest setting allowed by the hardware).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I did various trials, I report the outputs below.
&gt;
&gt; I see some variations in output even when it looks like the jackd
&gt; parameters are the same.  I don't quite understand why that might happen.
&gt;
&gt; Trial 1 and 2 show this:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 1 ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; On the master (Mac computer)
&gt; &gt; sh-3.2# jackd -P 70 -p96 -t 2000 -dcoreaudio  -s -r48000 -p128 -n2 -Cno
&gt; &gt; -Pyes
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; CoreAudio driver is running...
&gt; &gt; Starting Jack NetManager
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; Floating point exception: 8
&gt;
&gt; So after netmanager is loaded jackd dies with an exception.  Searching
&gt; google references to that exception number indicates that it can be
&gt; triggered by divide by 0 errors for integer or floating point, it is not
&gt; exclusively a floating point error.
&gt;
&gt; Trial 2 looks like the same startup parameters were used for jackd, but no
&gt; exception that time, but the netmanager crashes with bad socket
&gt; parameters:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 2 ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; On the master (Mac computer)
&gt; &gt; sh-3.2# jackd -P 70 -p96 -t 2000 -dcoreaudio  -s -r48000 -p128 -n2 -Cno
&gt; &gt; -Pyes
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; CoreAudio driver is running...
&gt; &gt; Starting Jack NetManager
&gt; &gt; Listening on '225.3.19.154:19000'
&gt; &gt; Sending parameters to ...
&gt; &gt; Can't set net buffer sizes : Invalid argument
&gt; &gt; SetParams error...
&gt;
&gt; I don't see anything on the jackd command line to explain why they failed
&gt; in two different ways.
&gt; I think someone with more experience with jackd on Mac will need to chime
&gt; in.
&gt;
&gt; I don't think you need to spend any time even starting jack on the odroid
&gt; yet.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 1 ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; On the master (Mac computer)
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; Floating point exception: 8
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 2 ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; On the master (Mac computer)
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; SetParams error...
&gt; &gt; Can't init new NetMaster...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 3----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; On the master (Mac computer)
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; Sending parameters to ...
&gt; &gt; Can't set net buffer sizes : Invalid argument
&gt; &gt; SetParams error...
&gt; &gt; Can't init new NetMaster...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 4 ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; The result are the same of before.,...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 5 ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; On the master (Mac computer)
&gt; &gt; Floating point exception: 8
&gt;
&gt; &gt; TRIAL 6 ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; Can't set net buffer sizes : Invalid argument
&gt; &gt; SetParams error...
&gt; &gt; Can't init new NetMaster...
&gt;
&gt; You obviously are not going to be able to get the odroid to connect to the
&gt; Mac until jackd can start the netmanager without crashing on the mac.
&gt;
&gt; Nothing obvious stands out as a cause, what is needed is more verbose
&gt; output from jackd to help determine the underlying cause of the crash in
&gt; netmanager.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know how directly comparable the messages from a linux computer
&gt; are to a mac build, but I had some trouble getting multicast packets
&gt; passed between machines, you may see if omping is available for MacOS, it
&gt; will verify that multicast traffic is enabled between the two devices.  I
&gt; had to build it for my ARM device running debian, it was available from
&gt; the Fedora repositories for my workstation.  Building from source was
&gt; simple on my ARM device, I just copied the source over and ran make, no
&gt; configuration necessary.
&gt;
&gt; This article indicates that multicast is not enabled by default on MacOS:
&gt; http://blogs.agilefaqs.com/2009/11/08/enabling-multicast-
&gt; on-your-macos-unix/
&gt;
&gt; That article is several years old, it may not be accurate for current
&gt; versions of MacOS, but definitely something to check.   On my linux
&gt; machines I got output messages to the effect that there seemed to be a
&gt; network problem, which is the point I went off and found omping and
&gt; figured out my firewall problems.  The messages on MacOS don't seem nearly
&gt; as helpful.
