Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Failures in connecting mac OSX Sierra and an embedded board with linux via netjack2

Dear Chris,
many thanks. Yes we would really need some feedback from jack developers at
this point.

If someone can direct me towards some specific procedures to solve the
problem I would be grateful.

I have already verified that multicast is enabled on my mac (latest macbook
pro October 2016 with OS X Sierra 10.12.4),
both on wireless and ethernet (with adaptor...) ports.

Cheers
