hdspmixer works with the Hammerfall DSP but it writes all over the mixer
right on startup.  Not suitable for changing single settings: I am using
alsactl for that right now.

Sigh, you are right.  But the question remains:  What applications will
support this and what does it mean?  For example, the DSP Hammerfall has
about two dozen inputs and about two dozen outputs.  What does "hardware
monitoring of capture ports" mean then?  Where are they monitored to by
which application?
