Can we focus on the question of what happens _with_ --hwmon to jackd
and/or the "via Audio Driver" monitoring option in Ardour?

I know what the mixer hardware can do in general and specifically when
using hdspmixer (or the equivalent amixer -d hw:DSP cset numid=5 ...).
But that's not relevant to Jack and wasn't my question.

Sigh.  I even listed the latencies involved here already.  Since the
mixing is in the digital domain, you get buffering delays and the delays
for the down-/up-sampling filters of A/D-D/A conversion, roughly 2ms all
in all.

That does not even make sense.  The audio interface needs to get passed
information by some software in order to do something specific.  It does
not have a button labelled "--hwmon" on its box.

I was not talking about using hdspmixer.  The question was what effects
jackd --hwmon and/or the Ardour monitoring option "via Audio Driver"
(discovered after the initial question was already posed but very likely
related) have.

Also the question was where information about supported cards and the
used API to Jack were to be found since the manual page describing the
options represented the status as of 2003 AD.

And if I am using a tape drive, I don't even need a computer.  But let's
assume, for the sake of solving this question, that I am using a
computer, not a mixing console, an RME Hammerfall DSP (or some other
supported card, whatever it may be) and am not using hdspmixer in order
to set up a monitoring solution independent of Jack and/or Ardour.
