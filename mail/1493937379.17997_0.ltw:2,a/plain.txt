Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] How does --hwmon work?

I found this reply from Paul Davis (original jackd author/designer) for
essentially the same question from many years back:

Most people do not use this. It is entirely replaced by using a h/w
specific utility (such as hdspmixer or envy2ctl) to control signal
routing. The one benefit that it has is that it means that JACK
*applications* can control that kind of routing, which early in the
life of Ardour seemed kind of important. It no longer seems very
important.
If you're already using a h/w specific utility for this purpose, then
don't use -H.

it doesn't really do anything. It was a placeholder for functionality
that has never been implemented because (a) so few cards implement it
and (b) the meter is basically useless for any app other than a h/w
specific utility app (which has other mechanisms available to get the
meter values).
---------------------------

So it looks like this feature never really became common, and it appears
that the jackd hardware monitor option only works on ICE or hdsp based
cards.  Maybe a few others, but unfortunately you would have to inspect
the ALSA driver source to make sure.

Which mixer?  The mixer in the audio interface?  I don't fully understand
the hardware configuration you are describing.

In practical terms it seems you will be tied to a particular soundcard, or
at least family of cards, since it seems only the ICE/envy24 drivers and
the RME drivers implemented this feature.  Maybe a few others, but good
luck figuring out which.

Only if the ALSA driver reports has_hw_monitoring as true.
Which driver does the Roland sound control use?

From a quick look at the jackd code it appears that the ALSA backend of
jackd queries the ALSA driver, and if the drivers reports
has_hw_monitoring then it sets the hw_monitoring property of the driver to
on if requested.  If the driver reports has_hw_monitoring as false then it
does nothing.

> the manual pages are vague and terribly outdated and

That is unfortunately true.  For most uses for which jack was designed, it
does what it is needed and has fallen into a barely maintained "just keep
it compiling" kind of state.  There is a new jackd maintainer, but I think
just working on it part time, and basic things like keeping man pages and
web pages up to date is not being done currently.

> Many ALSA cards have some sort of hardware mixer

Yes, but most of them have utilities for configuring the hardware mixer. 
The hwmon option to jackd is just on/off, it doesn't give any way to
control the gain of the connection, or the routing if there are multiple
inputs and multiple outputs.  I think the jackd option never caught on
because it was too limited to be useful.
