Hi Chris,
many thanks! I will have a look to your links and try your suggestion.

I am aware about the default route, indeed in my tests I first tried the
wired connection while disabling the wireless interface.


Cheers

&gt; &gt; How could I verify that multicast is actually working? If it was not
&gt; &gt; working then how the two machines could see each other?
&gt;
&gt; When I first attempted to connect two machines with netjack I found that
&gt; one machine could transmit and receive multicast, one machine could
&gt; transmit but not receive, so the status messages were confusing, e.g. one
&gt; machine would report that the connection was working, but then report
&gt; errors when it got no responses later.
&gt;
&gt; I found these links which may be useful.  I don't have a mac, so I can't
&gt; say how useful.
&gt; This seems like the most likely to be useful, an implementation of
&gt; multicast ping similar to omping but for Mac:
&gt; http://bdunagan.com/2010/03/31/multicast-ping-on-a-mac/
&gt;
&gt; Since you mentioned that your machine has two interfaces (I think you said
&gt; wired and wireless) you may want to turn off the wireless interface and
&gt; check with just the wired interface first.  On a unicast connection there
&gt; is a default route that your operating system uses to know where to send
&gt; packets with an address that is not known to be on the local network.
&gt; Usually an interface, and the address of a router.  For multicast the
&gt; operating system needs something similar, it needs to know which interface
&gt; to use when given a multicast packet to send.  I think with only one
&gt; interface enabled that should occur with no intervention, but with two
&gt; interfaces enabled you will probably have to configure the default route
&gt; to use for multicast addresses.
&gt;
&gt; I think this link explains how to do that from a terminal.  There may be
&gt; some network configuration GUI program which can do the same thing, but I
&gt; don't know.
