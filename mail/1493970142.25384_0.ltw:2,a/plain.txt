The typical sound card already has labelled ALSA controls for it (I
think the Firewire stack tends to moving to userspace applications for
mixer controls, but even those could be called from a Jack-controlled
thread).  The labels of those controls are just not associated with
standard meanings, but that could be rectified using asoundrc and its
ilk.  Basically the bits are there but not connected.

Controlling mixers other than manually?  If that were very unusual, Midi
control surfaces would not be as abundant as they are.

Analog mixing consoles are on their way out.  Digital control surfaces
are everywhere and it's a bit strange that in the Linux DAW world they
cannot make it through to the hardware.
