Sigh.  Alsa already offers fairly generic access to soundcard mixers
with the alsamixer and amixer commands.

Sigh.  I propose precisely that end user software should _not_ need to
care about whatever audio interface is connected.  That's one of the
points of Jack and ALSA.  Standard APIs to functionality that might be
implemented differently at the driver end.

Not enough if _every_ _single_ soundcard needs its own mixer application
coded from scratch.  If one creates a common useful Jack API for gained
connections that one mixer application can work with, there will
certainly be enough need to provide a Midi controlled mixer capable of
using hardware mixing where available.

The RME Hammerfall is dated (not that it doesn't hold its own pretty
well but you still need to hook it up with preamps and then stuff starts
getting bulky), and hdspmixer is pretty cumbersome to use.  I'd rather
whip up a few Ardour mixers for the connections I actually need and have
them delegate to hardware where feasible.

For hardware monitoring?  Hardly.  At driver level?  Maybe.  But then
it's not fundamentally different to Jack plugins.
