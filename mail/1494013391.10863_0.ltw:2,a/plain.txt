Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] homepage(s) and download links

I couldn't agree more. I posted a message to asking about the download
links on April 12. Nobody ever responded to me.

In the meantime, I just checked, and those bad dropbox links still exist on
the jack website.

Really guys?

Since I and others have inquired about the download links, you guys have
wasted no time answering someone's query's about using a Macbook with the
latest MacOS.

With all due respect, this project is a joke -- plus, once I finally did
manage to find the download links and install it, it didn't work on my
system (W7 64 bit). I wouldn't dream of even attempting to get help on this
list.

Again, what a joke: this is the reason open source software will never
catch on. You guys just don't care.
