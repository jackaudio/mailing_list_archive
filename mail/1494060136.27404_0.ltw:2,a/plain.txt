Which is why it makes good sense to have jackd fall back to software
gain when the card's known controls don't allow for using hardware.
That way you don't need specialized software to make best use of your
hardware.

Because what?  We don't separate software and hardware plugins either.
They are available as jack ports.  So why should a connection not be
hardware where supported?

A separated mixing console takes a whole lot more space than a
nanoKontrol if you are trying to get to a conference by train.

I mean, I'd get the "who's gonna do it" argument.  But this is going
more in the "let's keep things as badly interoperable as they are
because that is the way of our fathers" direction.

All I hear is "that is silly", "that is absurd", "that's not the right
way to do things".  But no actual argument why.

Jack prefers working at realtime priority and some plugins may do so as
well, possibly in relation to priority elevation.  Unfettered hardware
access is not necessary for the latency aspects.

Many affordable USB-level interfaces are quite more prone to xruns if
you drive them in full duplex.  So particularly on consumer hardware
(and that's what most people use) making use of available hardware
monitoring solutions employing the builtin mixers would make good sense.

Physical controllers are nice to use for that, and this is why software
like Ardour supports digital controllers which can be used for mixing
instead of a hardware mixer.  I don't see the point in maintaining
software/hardware barriers that should only be crossed using
hard-tailored rather than general-purpose software.
