&gt; Exactly!

&gt; So my guess is, that David does something more or less simply that

&gt; most of us, would be all we need. Neither the old, nor the new KORG

&gt; comfortable to use a nanoKONTROL to do the main mix, as well as the
&gt; monitoring. However, we don't now what he wants to do, that requires
&gt; hardware monitoring, so it's just guessing.

Uh, I described the exact application I was currently working on where I
found the existing connectivity lacking.

To make it easy for you, let's append the scripts in their current

olifant.py, the mididings script, is supposed to be generally useful to
people independent of what sound card they use.

It needs to switch off the Roland accordion output in the mixer (that's
what the roland_mute and roland_unmute calls are for), and it does not
make sense to simulate a hardware mixer with the more demanding
full-duplex software-mixing approach.  So what I do here in order to
keep things generally useful is passing an ALSA device and amixer
commands to use via environment variables.  That will cover the vast
majority of the use cases workable via hardware mixers accessible in
some manner via ALSA.

But it is a total crock to use that side path for functionality that
falls squarely in the realm of sound routing.  When there is no viable
hardware mixer, one has to use Jackd routing anyway.  So what's wrong
with Jackd gaining the ability to offload work to hardware whenever the
hardware is able to do the job?

This particular application can be fudged around, sure.  But it's not
like software-controllable setup of hardware monitoring is useless for
recording applications like Ardour.  And it does make sense to save your
monitoring solutions as part of an Ardour session rather than having to
manage them with separate applications not connected with the Ardour
session control.
