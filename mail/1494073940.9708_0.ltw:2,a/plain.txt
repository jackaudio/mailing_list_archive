If access to hardware mixers were as useful as a flying car, one has to
wonder why the ALSA programmers bothered providing it for a lot of
cards.

At any rate, your point of "nobody should want that or talk about it" is
abundantly clear without all the flowery comparisons you make.

Putting together something for producing sound using Midi controllers
for controlling more than a single part of the sound setup is not
exactly outlandish.  That's what digital controllers are for in the
first place.

You are the one who claims that Jackd should not be allowed to control
hardware monitoring because professionals use other hardware.

That's a single application I put together where it struck me as strange
that there seemed no ready application to do a rather mundane thing.

Not really.  I'll have to read the source code of Jack, the source code
of ALSA drivers, and the source code of Ardour (assuming that the "use
Audio Driver" option is either related to what I hoped what --hwmon
would do or to what it actually does) to figure stuff out because
nothing is actually documented or readily available knowledge.

What _is_ obvious is that nobody appears to be actively working on any
of what I was suspecting --hwmon to be useful for.

Because nobody bothered implementing stuff.  That's not the same as that
there would be no point to implementing it.
