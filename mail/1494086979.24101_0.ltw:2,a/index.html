&gt; hdspmixer controllable by a MIDI remote would be very pleasant, even a

RME?  The company that provided all the information needed for writing
stable ALSA interfaces for the RME Hammerfall, writing hdspconf, and
writing hdspmixer?  I think they've done everything expected from a nice
player.  The usefulness of what they have done definitely beats the crap
from companies "supporting" Linux like Nvidia, with no information but
proprietary drivers that stop working after a number of years.

RME hasn't written hdspconf.  They only made it possible.

&gt; While you are at it and wish to be able to replace audio interfaces,
&gt; ask other vendors as well.

What makes you think I want to "replace audio interfaces".

&gt; I won't reply to anything else, even if you should continue writing
&gt; polemic untruth, but the following question:
&gt;
&gt; Is there any DAW for a Microsoft or Apple based platform available,
&gt; that provides the combination of DAW mixer and audio interface mixer
&gt; you want to get?

I wouldn't know.  I don't use Microsoft or Apple based platforms.
Anybody here who does?
