RME?  The company that provided all the information needed for writing
stable ALSA interfaces for the RME Hammerfall, writing hdspconf, and
writing hdspmixer?  I think they've done everything expected from a nice
player.  The usefulness of what they have done definitely beats the crap
from companies "supporting" Linux like Nvidia, with no information but
proprietary drivers that stop working after a number of years.

RME hasn't written hdspconf.  They only made it possible.

What makes you think I want to "replace audio interfaces".

I wouldn't know.  I don't use Microsoft or Apple based platforms.
Anybody here who does?
