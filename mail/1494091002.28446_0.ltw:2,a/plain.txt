So what do you call "support" that is available for other operating
systems?

Interesting: I would have thought that hdspmixer is mostly confined to
HDSP cards.

Strange.  The HDSP has 8 channels in Jack.  Assuming that with channel
you mean one audio signal rather than one ADAT connector.

So I'd have expected either 8 or 0 supported channels.  2 is a strange
number.  I can't find an "RME AIO" on their web page (either under
current or legacy cards) so I cannot even guess.

Some of the latency is due to digital oversampling filters in A/D&D/A.
Reducing that latency (about 2ms) is not going to improve sound quality.

I am more concerned with unnecessary full-duplex operation at 96kHz: it
increases the likelihood of xruns.  Also it feels like additional
latency in the analog path for a mere relay of a signal is a bad idea.
Admittedly that argument seems a bit weak when my other way of sound
production runs through serial Midi first.  But the cost for that at
3 bytes per note is just 1ms (more for chords).

Well, my specs are 2.5GHz Penryn and 4GB of memory (extending memory to
8GB with DDR2 SODIMM would be about as expensive as the whole computer
was, and for audio recording it would not appear to make a difference).

Bottlenecks are more likely bus speed (800MHz I think, but with the RAM
connected with 667MHz) than anything else.  And current kernels.
