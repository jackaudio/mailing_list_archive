Ok, looking at the source code in Ardour shows that "via Audio Driver"
leads to a setting HardwareMonitoring that causes differences in the
code paths amounting to the additional call

                        (*chan)->source.request_input_monitoring (!(_session.config.get_auto_input() && rolling));

in the loop

                for (ChannelList::iterator chan = c->begin(); chan != c->end(); ++chan) {
                        (*chan)->source.request_input_monitoring (!(_session.config.get_auto_input() && rolling));
                        capturing_sources.push_back ((*chan)->write_source);
                        Source::Lock lock((*chan)->write_source->mutex());
                        (*chan)->write_source->mark_streaming_write_started (lock);
                }

in AudioDiskStream::prep_record_enable ().  And that seems to lead
(eventually) to jack_port_request_monitor.

Which depends on the capability described as:

    JackPortCanMonitor if JackPortCanMonitor is set, then a call to jack_port_-
    request_monitor() makes sense.
    Precisely what this means is dependent on the client. A typical result of
    it being called with TRUE as the second argument is that data that would
    be available from an output port (with JackPortIsPhysical set) is sent to a
    physical output connector as well, so that it can be heard/seen/whatever.
    Clients that do not control physical interfaces should never create ports with
    this bit set.

So the Ardour option basically is provided when Jack tells Ardour "this
output would be interested to know in the context of monitoring when you
would be getting into a recording situation in order to make the source
also available physically".

Something like that.  But what should actually happen is unclear.

The RME Totalmix block diagrams show a "Loopback" switch that allows
recording the hardware outputs (which are the mixer outputs created from
the various inputs as well as the sent signals into the sound cards)
rather than the inputs directly.  But that would be sort of the reverse
of monitoring (instead of providing the inputs also as outputs it
provides the outputs in place of the inputs).

So I'd probably have to read the ALSA driver and Jackd source codes to
figure out what happens when doing "record enable".  Or I experiment
with the hardware.
