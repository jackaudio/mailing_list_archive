For old cards, that amounts to providing a download for old stuff.
IÂ doubt that the support will amount to more than that.

That does not sound like a description of "support".

Ubuntu lowlatency with threadirqs enabled.

I am more in the 1024 or 2048 ballpark with 96kHz and the Hammerfall
DSP.  Which is a bit irritating since the Mackie Onyx Firewire card is
better satisfied with 512 samples running over the builtin Ricoh
Firewire controller of the Thinkpad T61.  That combination does not
sound like it should work better than the Hammerfall Cardbus interface.

I was not actually pitching for "pleasing me" but rather for figuring
out whether Jack/GNU/Linux get the best possible use of available
hardware.

Since the usual consequence of an xrun is to make whatever application
is currently running crash and burn (probably the process of bringing an
xrun to attention is tying up enough time to cause the next xrun), I am
not as much interested in latency optimization as I am in xrun
elimination at the moment.  And the change between full and half duplex
makes a noticeable difference in my perception.
