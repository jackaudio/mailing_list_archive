Downsampling from 48kHz to 44.1kHz is a lot uglier than from 96kHz.
Equalizers are a lot more similar to their analog counterparts when you
stay in good distance from the Nyquist frequency (you get frequency
warps otherwise).  Downsampling to consumer frequencies can use a lot
better filtering without realtime constraints.  Nonlinear processing
(like tube amp simulations and other distortions or pitch changes) may
bring inaudible frequencies into the audible domain.

And the analog circuitry for cutting out aliasing is a lot more relaxed
when working between 32kHz and 96kHz rather than 20.7kHz and 22.05kHz
(numbers pulled from the frequency ranges of the Hammerfall's specs).

When using a handheld recorder with electret capsules, I use
16bit/48kHz.  I can set it to 24bit/96kHz, but the additional storage is
just spent on noise and fantasy.

Well, I thought that Ubuntu Studio (though I don't know whether the
actual distribution from scratch differs from apt-get install
ubuntu-studio) should more or less know what it's doing.  But I haven't
investigated.

But there _are_ also some instructions on the net regarding how to set
up control groups best for audio, and I haven't looked at that either
yet.
