&gt;&gt;Looks like somebody is prioritizing my soundcards.
&gt;
&gt; Much likely it's Rui's rtirq script. For what ever reason Ubuntu
&gt; keeps it in init.d and doesn't start it by a systemd unit.
&gt;
&gt; http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/rtirq-init
&gt;
&gt; Instead of ps, you could run
&gt;
&gt; /etc/init.d/rtirq status
&gt;
&gt; I can't speak for your computer, but usually rtc shouldn't be
&gt; prioritised anymore and irqbalance should be completely removed.

It's been years since I touched the config file.  Probably I should
remove, install from scratch.

Oh wait.  snd_hda_ would be the laptop internal sound card, not the
Hammerfall DSP.  The latter doesn't have its own interrupt apparently,
so this would rather be, uh, irq/16-yenta ?  That one's at the bottom in
the list.  Darn it.  I probably removed it when I put the Hammerfall
into storage.  And got it out again since the Mackie Onyx mixer is too
bulky for Free Software conference duty.

So maybe I should give the Hammerfall a better chance at working.

&gt; Take a look at /etc/default/rtirq (on Arch Linux
&gt; it's /etc/conf.d/rtirq ;):
&gt;
&gt; [rocketmouse@archlinux ~]$ grep RTIRQ_NAME_LIST /etc/conf.d/rtirq | grep -v "#"
&gt; RTIRQ_NAME_LIST="usb snd_hdsp snd_ice1"

You probably have a PCI (or express) card rather than a Cardbus one?

&gt; Check the output of
&gt;
&gt; cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps setting it to performance helps to reduce xruns

I seem to remember that CPU switching speed with the Penryn is supposed
to be close enough, but I admit that if it were instantaneous it would
be indistinguishable from a power-saving halt state but full speed
otherwise.  I think I had the system on performance for a while but it
did not make a noticeable difference with regard to xruns.

I'll keep it in mind.
