It's been years since I touched the config file.  Probably I should
remove, install from scratch.

Oh wait.  snd_hda_ would be the laptop internal sound card, not the
Hammerfall DSP.  The latter doesn't have its own interrupt apparently,
so this would rather be, uh, irq/16-yenta ?  That one's at the bottom in
the list.  Darn it.  I probably removed it when I put the Hammerfall
into storage.  And got it out again since the Mackie Onyx mixer is too
bulky for Free Software conference duty.

So maybe I should give the Hammerfall a better chance at working.

You probably have a PCI (or express) card rather than a Cardbus one?

I seem to remember that CPU switching speed with the Penryn is supposed
to be close enough, but I admit that if it were instantaneous it would
be indistinguishable from a power-saving halt state but full speed
otherwise.  I think I had the system on performance for a while but it
did not make a noticeable difference with regard to xruns.

I'll keep it in mind.
