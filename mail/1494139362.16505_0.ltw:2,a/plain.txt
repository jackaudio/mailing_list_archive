Well, there is irq/16-snd_hdsp after all once I plug the Cardbus card in
(it's usually out in the morning since the computer doesn't wake up
successfully from suspend otherwise).  And it's prioritized well enough
once I _rerun_ /etc/init.d/rtirq.  Otherwise it sticks at the bottom.

Ok, something to keep in mind.
