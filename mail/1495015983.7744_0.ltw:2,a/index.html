Replying from phone, sorry for top posting... (in the airport now).

When i took over as maintainer of jack1, I specifically mentioned not
wanting to take care of the website.
Tbh i dont know who has access, and I dont think i do.
I did not took over jack2 though, so my own changes there always go through
sletz.

LAC is here, its the perfect oportunity to talk about this.

@Markus I would be very happy if you took care of the website part of the
jack project :)

&gt; Hello again,
&gt;
&gt; as elaborated in my previous mail (bad news) the jackaudio.org page is
&gt; kind of in trouble.
&gt;
&gt; Before these problems can be resolved, there are a few things that have
&gt; to be made clear:
&gt;
&gt; 1  Who has currently access to the webspace hosting jackaudio.org? I
&gt; know Paul has, I think St&#xE9;phane has and somewhere in the back of my head
&gt; a voice tells me the Filipe might have access?
&gt;
&gt; 2  What I know is, that whoever has access to the webspace of
&gt; jackaudio.org has not been monitoring the jack-devel list for my pull
&gt; requests. I asked Paul directly and it was done, but I think that should
&gt; not be required all the time, so here are some proposals:
&gt;
&gt; 2.1  Allow me to access the webspace and do the updates myself. I do not
&gt; need a real shell, some kind of file system access should be sufficient.
&gt;
&gt; Pro:
&gt; * technically easy, depending on how it's done
&gt; * simplifies communication for me (no need to send pull requests to the
&gt; List)
&gt; * will result in fast updates in the future
&gt; * adds no more dependecy on GitHub services
&gt; Con:
&gt; * trust/security/legal concerns
&gt; * shifts more responsibility on me, reduces control for the webspace owner
&gt; * still fails in case I am not available
&gt;
&gt; 2.2  Set up continuous integration process
&gt; GitHub offers an API for interacting with external services in case a
&gt; repository is updated. This could be used to deploy changes in the
&gt; jackaudio.org repository automatically to the webspace. I would need to
&gt; look up how this could work in detail and if there are additional costs
&gt; involved. Maybe it can be done in the same way as the ardour.org
&gt; homepage is set up?
&gt;
&gt; Pro:
&gt; * removes more need for manual intervention in the long run
&gt; * no need to authorize additional users to access the webspace
&gt; * keeps working even if the maintainers of the website changes
&gt; Con:
&gt; * requires an external or internal service to be authorized to access
&gt; the webspace
&gt; * requires some amount of initial setup and testing
&gt; * adds a dependecy on GitHub services
&gt; * needs documentation and maintenance cost might be to high
&gt;
&gt; 2.3  Remove the webspace from the chain completely.
&gt; The page will then be hosted only on GitHub pages under the
&gt; jackaudio.org domain.
&gt;
&gt; Pro:
&gt; * simplifies deployment considerably
&gt; * Deployment does not depend on multiple people anymore: faster, less
&gt; work hours wasted
&gt; * Deployment of updates will be much faster
&gt; * more features of the GitHub Pages service can be used, like fetching
&gt; repository metadata, hosting of binaries, etc...
&gt; * Adding/removing maintainers is easy and handled through access to the
&gt; GitHub repository
&gt; Con:
&gt; * Makes the page dependant on GitHub, if GitHub goes down or evil, so
&gt; will the page. Still, it will be possible to host the static page on any
&gt; webspace when that happens and just change the domain record.
&gt; * Domain owner has less control over the page content.
&gt; * Needs some setup by the domain owner, I remember there have been
&gt; concerns about the records for mail adresses and the jack mailing lists.
&gt; (not entirely sure since the lists seem to sit on a subdomain, this
&gt; probably also entails security concerns...)
&gt;
&gt; 2.4  Migrate to something completely unrelated. aka Your suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; 3  hosting of binaries
&gt; This needs input by those who manage the releases of jack1 and jack2
&gt; since it is tied into the release process.
&gt;
&gt; What users usually expect is the following ordered by importance
&gt; (subjective):
&gt; a) one official location for downloads
&gt; b) a predictable and consistent naming convention for files and archives
&gt; and the contents (especially for packaging)
&gt; c) predictable and consistent URLs for all versions and
&gt; variants(especially for packaging)
&gt; d) complete source tarballs
&gt; e) patchnotes
&gt; f) additional mirrors
&gt; g) checksums
&gt; h) release announcement
&gt;
&gt; b, d, e, g, and h are usually provided by the ones responsible for the
&gt; releases, the rest depends on which approach was chosen in section 2.
&gt; If the webspace is used, I strongly suggest to use it also for the
&gt; binries and in case I get access I can offer to put the binaries there
&gt; for you in the right place. Otherwise there is the opportunity to create
&gt; tags on your GitHub repositories and attach the files there, which is
&gt; also a nice place to put checksums, patchnotes and other version
&gt; information and also provides automatically a source archive of the
&gt; tagged commit.
&gt;
&gt; I will not add the binaries into the repository of the webpage and git
&gt; LFS does not sound especially compelling to me too since it requires,
&gt; surprise, external hosting of the files anyway and in that case, there
&gt; is almost no gain over just using the webspace or the GitHub releases
&gt; features.
&gt;
&gt; Dear Paul, dear St&#xE9;phane, dear Filipe,
&gt; maybe talk to each other on the LAC about it and come to a conclusion,
&gt; because I am at a loss here and can not go any further without your
&gt; intervention. It's not the end of the world, but it kind of keeps
&gt; bugging me and the users.
&gt;
&gt; best regards
&gt; Markus
