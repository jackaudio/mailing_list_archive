Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Using Jack in 10.10 and later?

I was writing a project called CaptainJack that used macOS's new HAL audio
subsystem to do just this.

The problem is that the service that runs that is supposed to talk to JACK
has to run under a particular user, which is never the user that's running
the JACK daemon. JACK doesn't support multi-user setups, and the developers
refuse to make this an out of the box thing to support (
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack1/issues/52). Because of that, I
discontinued development on CaptainJack.

If they change their minds, I'll happily finish CaptainJack as I find a
use-case for it almost every week.
