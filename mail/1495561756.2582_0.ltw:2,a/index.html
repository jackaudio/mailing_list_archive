&gt; 
&gt; NetJACK sends its audio data via UDP [1], e.g. there's no resending of lost
&gt; packets like in TCP. If packets are lost (which is *very* likely over wireless),
&gt; the packets are really lost and you miss a chunk of audio frames, hence your
&gt; garbled sound at the receiver.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That being said, reading the doc and looking around the web for info
&gt;&gt; suggests it might very well be the case that NetJack2 simply isn't
&gt;&gt; suited for WLAN transport. Indeed, some resources indicate that NetJack1
&gt;&gt; would be more adapted.
&gt; Same problem there...

Thanks for the reply!

So your view is that packet loss is the cause? I had na&#xEF;vely assumed it
might be due to latency or congestion, but packet loss would make a lot
of sense. Although -- I hadn't mentioned this explicitly, but my setup
is with both boxes connected on the same local network, in other words
both to the same WiFi router; can there really be such a dramatic amount
of packet loss in that context for the result to be completely garbled
sound? I'm not talking about clicks here and there, but really little
better than static. I wouldn't have expected that; although at the same
time I'm no networking expert...

If so, then I guess what you're saying is that there's simply no way to
leverage NetJack, whether NetJack1 or NetJack2, for transport over
wireless?
