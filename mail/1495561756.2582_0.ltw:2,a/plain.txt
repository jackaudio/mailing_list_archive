Thanks for the reply!

So your view is that packet loss is the cause? I had na√Øvely assumed it
might be due to latency or congestion, but packet loss would make a lot
of sense. Although -- I hadn't mentioned this explicitly, but my setup
is with both boxes connected on the same local network, in other words
both to the same WiFi router; can there really be such a dramatic amount
of packet loss in that context for the result to be completely garbled
sound? I'm not talking about clicks here and there, but really little
better than static. I wouldn't have expected that; although at the same
time I'm no networking expert...

If so, then I guess what you're saying is that there's simply no way to
leverage NetJack, whether NetJack1 or NetJack2, for transport over
wireless?
