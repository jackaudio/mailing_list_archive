Hi,
I think audio over wi-fi is a non-starter. it will never be glitch free.
I&#x2019;m rewiring my own studio at the moment with fast router and cat 7 ethernet. 
I use Artsmesh (MacOS) to route all the audio/video in the studio and over the internet 
(uses jack/jacktrip, ffmpeg/syphon) and has a better interface than qjackctl.

Ken

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work over WLAN, which it doesn't. Over wireless, the sound is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completely garbled. AFAICT, it's a network issue.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; NetJACK sends its audio data via UDP [1], e.g. there's no resending of
&gt;&gt;&gt; lost
&gt;&gt;&gt; packets like in TCP. If packets are lost (which is *very* likely over
&gt;&gt;&gt; wireless), the packets are really lost and you miss a chunk of audio
&gt;&gt;&gt; frames, hence your garbled sound at the receiver.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So your view is that packet loss is the cause? I had naively assumed it
&gt;&gt; might be due to latency or congestion, but packet loss would make a lot
&gt;&gt; of sense. Although -- I hadn't mentioned this explicitly, but my setup
&gt;&gt; is with both boxes connected on the same local network, in other words
&gt;&gt; both to the same WiFi router; can there really be such a dramatic amount
&gt;&gt; of packet loss in that context for the result to be completely garbled
&gt;&gt; sound? I'm not talking about clicks here and there, but really little
&gt;&gt; better than static.
&gt; 
&gt; If the sound is always garbled, it never even starts out with decent
&gt; quality, then you may be right, latency could be causing every cycle to
&gt; not have enough time.  Do you get a lot of under-run notifications when
&gt; starting?  If latency is the only problem you may be able to set a larger
&gt; number of network cycles and get around that.
&gt; You should be able to get some packet loss statistics from ifconfig, it
&gt; would be worth checking to see if there are lots of RX errors or RX
&gt; dropped notifications.  I don't know how well that information is gathered
&gt; for UDP packets, so using iperf to generate traffic and then looking how
&gt; many dropped packets were detected would be good.  You could probably get
&gt; an idea from iperf of the average and maximum latency as well.
&gt; 
&gt; In general real time audio transmission over Wi-Fi is going to be
&gt; difficult.  I have no trouble streaming FLAC files to music players over
&gt; Wi-Fi, but those buffer over half a second of audio, and are using TCP so
&gt; the TCP layer will just send again any packets which get dropped. When
&gt; using jack the network connection has to be able to send packets reliably
&gt; with low latency, and no matter what you do Wi-Fi is still going to be a
&gt; shared medium, so every time another device anywhere in the local vicinity
&gt; transmits, your devices are going to have to listen to see if they need to
&gt; switch to a different channel, or pause to allow fair time for another
&gt; device.  That other device might belong to your neighbor, so you can't
&gt; assume that just because you have only two devices connected to your
&gt; router that there will not be other interference.
