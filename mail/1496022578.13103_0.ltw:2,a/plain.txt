Hi,
I think audio over wi-fi is a non-starter. it will never be glitch free.
Iâ€™m rewiring my own studio at the moment with fast router and cat 7 ethernet. 
I use Artsmesh (MacOS) to route all the audio/video in the studio and over the internet 
(uses jack/jacktrip, ffmpeg/syphon) and has a better interface than qjackctl.

Ken
