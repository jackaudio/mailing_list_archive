Hmm - sounds very interesting. Thank's for pointing this out.

In realtime audio a package congestion IS a lost packagage. It doesn't make sense
to resend a package that should have been played in the past.

Both clients send on the same channel - i.e. block each other. WiFi is, by it's very
nature, half-duplex, only one client can send (after all, there's a reason  why they
called it ETHER-net ... ;-)

A package too late is a package not played ....
