Jack relies on system audio drivers, so that question really depends on
whether there is an ALSA driver for bluetooth.  As such it is not really a
jack question at all, so you would need to ask on the ALSA and pulseaudio
lists.

Most use of bluetooth would be connecting to a bluetooth device, i.e.
playing computer audio through a bluetooth headphone.  What you want is
for your computer to act as if the computer is a bluetooth headphone. 
That is not a common use case, so I would be very surprised if that
connection direction is supported.
