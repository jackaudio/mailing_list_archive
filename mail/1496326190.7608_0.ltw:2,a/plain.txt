IIRC once I setup bluetooth my phone automatically routed audio through to
my [archlinux] laptop when connected, at least for notifications and the
like. It was never something I setup intentionally though so I can't help
with details. Pretty sure I was using a windows phone at the time; possibly
it was android.
