All,

Thank you very much for you inputs.

I have run an analyser on my network, and I'm indeed getting a
horrendous (to the naive) amount of packet loss. Given that, it makes
perfect sense that jackd wouldn't be able to get coherent audio together.

A fair point. The reason I had been focussing on packet loss vs.
congestion is because I had read somewhere that you could have different
transport characteristics depending on whether you were using unicast or
multi/broadcast; differences which might be in play if the problem were
congestion, but not if it were packet loss. Since (correct me if I'm
wrong) NetJack1 uses unicast, whereas NetJack2 uses broad/multicast,
trying NetJack1 would have offered a possible, and close-by, solution. I
was merely trying to tailor the problem to what seemed like the
lowest-hanging solutions. But this is moot now.

.-.

I'm currently rewriting my software and abstracting out the transport,
which I'll do myself instead of relying on Jack (Jack will still be
digesting the audio on the endpoint; just not transporting it there).

Once the framework is in place, I want to try with a simple TCP
transport and see what kind of reliability and latency I can achieve
with that. Perhaps it'll be workable, perhaps not. I can't really afford
the behaviour of the more common over-the-air music players which, as
Chris pointed out, will buffer quite heftily to achieve reliability.

Further on, I'd also like to try something like SCTP
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol>)
and see what gives -- although the Windoze support for that seems
sketchy, at best.
