&gt; Hello!&#xA0; As a person who only knows for sure that sound goes in the

&gt; to figure out how to record more than one line at a time I am
&gt; arriving at JACK, only to find it is apparently either member
&gt; only or invitation only website.&#xA0; Not knowing the protocol here,
&gt; I am asking:1.&#xA0; How can I get invited/allowed to get JACK to try
&gt; and learn what all it can do to/for me?2.&#xA0; If I can get the
&gt; invitation, I need to know how to physically install it as
&gt; nothing like JACK is in the mint software manager unless one
&gt; counts the 12 or so things that appear to be addins to JACK.
&gt; There is no actual installer that I see which makes complete
&gt; sense if this is a somewhat restricted software.3.&#xA0; Can you
&gt; inform me of what software will best handle more than one line
&gt; in?&#xA0; Audacity, which is all I have ever used I thought powerful
&gt; until I realize it will handle only one input.

Ardour (http://ardour.org) is probably what you're looking for.
You can use it with or without JACK. There's an Ardour forum if
you need help.

&gt; As background last night I did get some of the things off the
&gt; repository of mint like QJackCtL, and Jack Rack.&#xA0; What I saw
&gt; was that QJackCtlL turns off any sound that is being
&gt; played/recorded the instant I selected any button on the
&gt; window.&#xA0; Not a great start.&#xA0; 

I'm not a Mint user, but I'm guessing that if you have QJackCtl
you will also have JACK installed already (look for jackd, jackd1
or jackd2 package). Try typing "man jackd" on the command line
and see if the jackd manpage is displayed.

If you use Ardour it has its own JACK-aware connection manager.

Hope this helps.
