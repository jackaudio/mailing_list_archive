Ardour (http://ardour.org) is probably what you're looking for.
You can use it with or without JACK. There's an Ardour forum if
you need help.

I'm not a Mint user, but I'm guessing that if you have QJackCtl
you will also have JACK installed already (look for jackd, jackd1
or jackd2 package). Try typing "man jackd" on the command line
and see if the jackd manpage is displayed.

If you use Ardour it has its own JACK-aware connection manager.

Hope this helps.
