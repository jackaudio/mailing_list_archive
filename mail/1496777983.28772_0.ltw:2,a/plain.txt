Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [Ann] Radium 4.8.7 and Kill Jack

Hi, here's a couple of jack-related releases:

1. Radium just got support for Jack Transport. Radium is a DAW.
http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/

2. Kill Jack is a program that kills Jack unconditionally. Binaries for
Linux/OSX/Windows are available in the github repo, in addition
to source code: https://github.com/kmatheussen/KillJack

About Kill Jack:
============
The Jack server sometimes crashes/freezes in ways which make users restart
the computer in order to use Jack again.

Users don't really have to restart the computer, but googling the problem
and finding a solution could take more time than restarting.

This is not very user friendly.

The problem exists on all platforms. It's not a bug in Jack per se, it's
how the program reacts when a client misbehave in certain ways.
