I'm already maintaining the qjackctl releases for windows, at least it's my
build that's included in the latest jack for windows. It might not be so
much work to create binary releases for windows, but I don't want to take
on too much work. If we are able to cross-compile jack on windows under
linux (which shouldn't be a problem), I guess it would be natural for me to
make releases, and to a certain degree maintain it (although I don't know
so much about the jack codebase), so that both qjackctl and jack are in
sync on windows.
