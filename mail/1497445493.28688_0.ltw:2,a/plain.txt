Hi,
i'm just thinking out loud for releases -

Hand-crafting a release for OS X or Windows sounds like serious magic for
most people while for Linux it's relatively straight forward.

If there would be a release process that's doing all the hard work
automatically, a new release wouldn't bind resources that are more
valuable to invest in other aspects. There wouldn't be -RC releases and
found to be good binaries would be just a specific release out of a
(RC-style release) series.

IMO the Ardour project is a good example of how to handle releases. They
manage to automatically create binaries (in several variations) for Linux,
OS X and Windows on a daily basis.
While the JACK codebase won't change on a daily basis, the release process
can be handy nonetheless. I wondered if some of the Ardour build
infrastructure could be re-used for JACK? Like surfing on the same wave.
Robin could do it i'm sure - I'm wondering if this is looked at as a
reasonable proposal. I'm sure we'd find community members to sponsor the
needed initial work in some way to people who can do it.
Any thoughts?

Best regards
Thomas
