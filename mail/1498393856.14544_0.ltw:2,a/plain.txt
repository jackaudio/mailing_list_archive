Hi, I just took a glance at the source code of jack2,
and when you get this message:

  "Jack: JackEngine::ClientExternalClose ref = 2"

...and you don't see any message about "Kill", it's the client
that has called jack_close(). So it seems like BitWig has called
jack_close() manually. However, the rest of the messages
indicates that something is wrong somewhere.
