jackdmp ends up in this code right after closing the client.

"
            // Last client and temporay case: quit the server
            jack_log("JackEngine::ReleaseRefnum server quit");
            fEngineControl->fTemporary = false;
            throw JackTemporaryException();
"

Does it mean that jackd was started automatically by the client?
(I guess not since "-v" was added explicitly by jonetsu.)

Anyone?
