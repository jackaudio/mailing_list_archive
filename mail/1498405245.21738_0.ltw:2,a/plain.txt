Not sure. There is something called "Temporary mode" which is enabled
with the option "-T". I can't find documentation about what it does, but
if you start jackd without the "-T" option, we should see a different
output in the terminal.

My _guess_ is that temporary mode automatically shuts down the
jack server when the last client exits, and that this behavior doesn't
work well with bitwig since it opens and closes several clients
during its lifetime.
