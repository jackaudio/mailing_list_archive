&gt;         &gt;   I'm new to Jack. Can it be used to redirect audio output over
&gt;         &gt; Bluetooth?
&gt;
&gt;         Most use of bluetooth would be connecting to a bluetooth
&gt;         device, i.e.
&gt;         playing computer audio through a bluetooth headphone.  What
&gt;         you want is
&gt;         for your computer to act as if the computer is a bluetooth
&gt;         headphone.
&gt;         That is not a common use case, so I would be very surprised if
&gt;         that
&gt;         connection direction is supported.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     IIRC once I setup bluetooth my phone automatically routed audio
&gt;     through to my [archlinux] laptop when connected, at least for
&gt;     notifications and the like. It was never something I setup
&gt;     intentionally though so I can't help with details. Pretty sure I
&gt;     was using a windows phone at the time; possibly it was android.
&gt;
&gt;     ... not that any of this brings the subject closer to being on
&gt;     topic for JACK. I'll be quiet now :)

That is workings of the PuleAudio. PA acts as a A2DP client and Jack can 
just use its sinks/sources injected into Jack as ports via 
bluetooth-jack driver - or via ALSA mediator.
So PA does remember your connections to each port and restores them once 
both ends of connection become available (done by various *-restore 
modules).
The problem with this setup of course is latency - PA+BT = (almost) 
indefinite latency. So jack bus can be used here - but with little or no 
benefits. Much easier (and more reliable) would be to connect them all 
by PA.
