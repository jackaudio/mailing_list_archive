That is workings of the PuleAudio. PA acts as a A2DP client and Jack can 
just use its sinks/sources injected into Jack as ports via 
bluetooth-jack driver - or via ALSA mediator.
So PA does remember your connections to each port and restores them once 
both ends of connection become available (done by various *-restore 
modules).
The problem with this setup of course is latency - PA+BT = (almost) 
indefinite latency. So jack bus can be used here - but with little or no 
benefits. Much easier (and more reliable) would be to connect them all 
by PA.
