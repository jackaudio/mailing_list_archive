I'm able to run the command from the command line and Jack runs fine. 
The thing is it won't run on boot. Actually, when booting up, after I 
realize that Pd is running but Jack isn't (no sound is coming out, plus 
the DSP can't go on in Pd, there's an LED for visual feedback that 
doesn't go on), I SSH to the Odroid, and typing "top" sometimes shows 
jack the first time, consuming quite some CPU (like 67 or even higher), 
and then Jack disappears. Trying to kill Jack with "killall jackd" gives 
me that there's no process found.

I read some threads about it and saw something about /etc/init.d/jackd 
and /etc/default/jackd which were not in my system.
In this thread 
http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/autostarting-jackd-at-bootup-with-Ubuntu-Debian-td66899.html 
there are two links to these scripts, but putting them there (and making 
/etc/init.d/jackd executable) didn't do the trick.
