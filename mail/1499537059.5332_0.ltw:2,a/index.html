&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe you need a sleep to make sure that jack is really running
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before you start pd?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But the script runs fine when launched manually. It's just that jack
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't run on boot.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you start jackd at boot, you start it for the very first time. If
&gt;&gt;&gt; you start jackd after that from command line, it's already in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; cache and might launch faster. I don't think it's the culprit, but it
&gt;&gt;&gt; explains that running software for the first time does take longer,
&gt;&gt;&gt; than starting it for the second time.
&gt;&gt; So do you recommend to add a delay after launching jack and before
&gt;&gt; launching pd?
&gt; It doesn't harm.
&gt;
&gt; But instead of continuing guessing, it's much more important to
&gt; redirect jackd's stdout und stderr to a log file, as explained by
&gt; precious replies.
Well, I just tried to redirect jack's stdout and stderr as you suggested 
to /tmp/jackd.log, but it doesn't happen. I created the following script 
called 'launch_jack.sh':
date &gt;&gt;/tmp/jackd.log; killall -9 jackd; sleep 5; jackd -dalsa -dhw:1 
-i2 -o4 -p512 -r48000 &gt;&gt;/tmp/jackd.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;

And then changed the rc.local to call this script, but there's no 
jackd.log file. Again, if I run the script manually from the terminal, 
the file is created and the following is being written in it:
