Well, I just tried to redirect jack's stdout and stderr as you suggested 
to /tmp/jackd.log, but it doesn't happen. I created the following script 
called 'launch_jack.sh':
date >>/tmp/jackd.log; killall -9 jackd; sleep 5; jackd -dalsa -dhw:1 
-i2 -o4 -p512 -r48000 >>/tmp/jackd.log 2>&1 &

And then changed the rc.local to call this script, but there's no 
jackd.log file. Again, if I run the script manually from the terminal, 
the file is created and the following is being written in it:
