Shrug.  Jackd does not offer backends of its own.  Its point is that it
puts the real-time critical part of audio processing into a separate
process so that it can be better prioritized (as well as developed and
optimized) than something running in the same process and address space
as a large audio processing application.

So it's not really all that surprising that some backend works better
with jackd in the middle than using it directly.  If it were, Jack would
be sort-of pointless compared to something like alsalib.
