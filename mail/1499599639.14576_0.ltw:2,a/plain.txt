So, I should replace (not that I've tried already) Hermann's suggestion 
with the following:

description "Job that runs the foo daemon"

# start in normal runlevels when disks are mounted and networking is available
start on runlevel [2345]

# stop on shutdown/halt, single-user mode and reboot
stop on runlevel [016]

env statedir=/var/cache/foo

# create a directory needed by the daemon
pre-start exec mkdir -p "$statedir"

exec /usr/bin/foo-daemon --arg1 "hello world" --statedir "$statedir"

Taken from the link you provided, right? This example is for a 
/etc/init/foo.conf file. Should I create a /etc/init/jackd.conf file? If 
so, I guess I should change some stuff, like the last two lines. But 
what should I put there instead?

-rt is the default behavior in Pd, if I'm not mistaken. Never-the-less I 
tried to launch it with this flag and ALSA but I still get dropouts.

I'll try again. I tried to add 'jack_wait -w' to my script, and again 
running manually works fine, but on boot jack_wait waits for ever and 
jack never starts.
