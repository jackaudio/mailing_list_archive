jack_wait -w actually helped with creating a log file. Here's the output:

JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10
Failed to connect to session bus for device reservation Unable to 
autolaunch a dbus-daemon without a $DISPLAY$

Audio device hw:1 cannot be acquired...
Cannot initialize driver
JackServer::Open failed with -1
Failed to open server


Even if I change hw:1 to hw:USB I get the same with:
Audio device hw:USB cannot be acquired...

Is there a chance that jack starts before the system sees the USB sound 
card? Should I put a 'sleep 10' before launching jack in the script?
