&gt; jack_wait -w actually helped with creating a log file. Here's the output:

The following seems to happen: when you start jackd manually, you already
have a graphical environment providing $DISPLAY which is again used by
dbus.
When you start jackd during boot, it will fail if there is no graphical
environment started yet.

Many distros have stock jackd that expects dbus which again is relatively
tightly bound to the desktop.

You can try these things:
-compile jackd without dbus support (if you don't need it for your app)
-start jackd with a startup mechanism that's run by your graphical
environment (after it's ready and $DISPLAY is set)

Hope that helps,
Thomas
