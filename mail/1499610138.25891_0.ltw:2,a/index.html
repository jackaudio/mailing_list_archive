&gt;&gt; jack_wait -w actually helped with creating a log file. Here's the output:

&gt; The following seems to happen: when you start jackd manually, you already
&gt; have a graphical environment providing $DISPLAY which is again used by
&gt; dbus.
&gt; When you start jackd during boot, it will fail if there is no graphical
&gt; environment started yet.
&gt;
&gt; Many distros have stock jackd that expects dbus which again is relatively
&gt; tightly bound to the desktop.
&gt;
&gt; You can try these things:
&gt; -compile jackd without dbus support (if you don't need it for your app)
&gt; -start jackd with a startup mechanism that's run by your graphical
&gt; environment (after it's ready and $DISPLAY is set)
Indeed that seems like a reason. I'm SSHing into to Odroid with -X so I 
can launch Pd with its GUI, so I tried to SSH without -X and jack 
wouldn't start, but then SSHing back with -X made jack start.

I'd rather not compile something since it took me quite some time to 
find an image for the Odroid with which I could get descent sound. Since 
now the sound is coming out nice, I'd rather keep the software the way 
it is. That being said, I'd rather go for your second suggestion.
Can you post an example of how I should start jack with a startup 
mechanism that's run by my graphical environment? I'm not really 
following there...
