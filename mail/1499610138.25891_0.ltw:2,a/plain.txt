Indeed that seems like a reason. I'm SSHing into to Odroid with -X so I 
can launch Pd with its GUI, so I tried to SSH without -X and jack 
wouldn't start, but then SSHing back with -X made jack start.

I'd rather not compile something since it took me quite some time to 
find an image for the Odroid with which I could get descent sound. Since 
now the sound is coming out nice, I'd rather keep the software the way 
it is. That being said, I'd rather go for your second suggestion.
Can you post an example of how I should start jack with a startup 
mechanism that's run by my graphical environment? I'm not really 
following there...
