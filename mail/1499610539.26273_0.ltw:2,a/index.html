&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll try again. I tried to add 'jack_wait -w' to my script, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again running manually works fine, but on boot jack_wait waits for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever and jack never starts.
&gt;&gt;&gt; jack_wait -w actually helped with creating a log file. Here's the
&gt;&gt;&gt; output:

&gt;&gt; The following seems to happen: when you start jackd manually, you
&gt;&gt; already have a graphical environment providing $DISPLAY which is again
&gt;&gt; used by dbus. When you start jackd during boot, it will fail if there is
&gt;&gt; no graphical environment started yet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Many distros have stock jackd that expects dbus which again is
&gt;&gt; relatively tightly bound to the desktop.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You can try these things:
&gt;&gt; -compile jackd without dbus support (if you don't need it for your app)
&gt;&gt; -start jackd with a startup mechanism that's run by your graphical
&gt;&gt; environment (after it's ready and $DISPLAY is set)
&gt; Indeed that seems like a reason. I'm SSHing into to Odroid with -X so I
&gt; can launch Pd with its GUI, so I tried to SSH without -X and jack wouldn't
&gt; start, but then SSHing back with -X made jack start.
&gt;
&gt; I'd rather not compile something since it took me quite some time to
&gt; find an image for the Odroid with which I could get descent sound. Since
&gt; now the sound is coming out nice, I'd rather keep the software the way it
&gt; is. That being said, I'd rather go for your second suggestion. Can you
&gt; post an example of how I should start jack with a startup mechanism that's
&gt; run by my graphical environment? I'm not really following there...

Ah.. maybe this is a headless system so you can't do that.
Compiling jack is straight forward. install build-essential, clone jackd
github repo and you're almost there.
IIRC there are hacks that pretend a dbus env for jack, somebody has to
chime in.
