&gt;     Indeed that seems like a reason. I'm SSHing into to Odroid with -X
&gt;     so I can launch Pd with its GUI, so I tried to SSH without -X and
&gt;     jack wouldn't start, but then SSHing back with -X made jack start.
&gt;
&gt;     Can you post an example of how I should start jack with a startup
&gt;     mechanism that's run by my graphical environment? I'm not really
&gt;     following there...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Having the graphical environment start jackd assumes that there is a 
&gt; graphical environment running on the Odroid, which I don't believe is 
&gt; the case here? Using -X with ssh forwards X11 connection attempts on 
&gt; the Odroid to the X server on your local machine, but since dbus afaik 
&gt; isn't network transparent[1] the DISPLAY you end up with via ssh -X 
&gt; will I think not be useful for the dbus side of jack. So you can 
&gt; probably get away with setting DISPLAY to something arbitrary in your 
&gt; init script, like:
&gt;
&gt; DISPLAY=:0 jackd -dalsa ...
That did it, kind of... Jack is starting and Pd too, but I get no sound. 
The DSP does go on (there's an LED on the synth I've built that goes on 
when Pd's DSP is on) but I can't hear anything.
Now though, I can SSH into the Odroid without -X and the script 
launching jack and Pd works and sounds works fine.

This is jack's log:

But this is the log when the script is run manually (and sound works 
properly):

So, what could the issue be now?
