That did it, kind of... Jack is starting and Pd too, but I get no sound. 
The DSP does go on (there's an LED on the synth I've built that goes on 
when Pd's DSP is on) but I can't hear anything.
Now though, I can SSH into the Odroid without -X and the script 
launching jack and Pd works and sounds works fine.

This is jack's log:

But this is the log when the script is run manually (and sound works 
properly):

So, what could the issue be now?
