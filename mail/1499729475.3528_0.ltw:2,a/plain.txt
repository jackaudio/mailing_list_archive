Hi, just want to say I also discovered JamRouter this past weekend, and was
  thinking the same - what others think of it and if it has been 
discussed before.
Very impressive documentation. I'm not sure if I'm reading the tables
  correctly, but it seems as if the latency may be worse in some cases
  than without it? Maybe on LAU or LAD others may chime in.

Tim.
