Yes that driver is nice, IIRC basically same code as the old external 
a2jmidi.
I seem to recall also someone recently posted they had fixed hot-plugging
  for that driver in jack(2?). Nice.

I think the project mentions some of that, specifying to use an rt kernel.
It sure helps ensure the tightest possible timing.

(Hm, I have not used an rt kernel in a very long time, and I didn't use one
  when writing and testing MusE's midi external clock sync input support.
I was getting a lot of frustrating clock jitter! It forced me to write heavy
  multi-stage filtering and all o' that stuff, with user-selectable 
heaviness.
I really must go back and test with rt kernel. Wonder how it'll fare.
Funny I'm actually working in this area now...)

Cheers.
Tim.
