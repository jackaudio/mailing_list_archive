Good catch. In my experience, Ardour's manual isn't always up-to-date.
NIH is definitely not something I think of about when Ardour is mentioned.
It has always used lots of 3rd party libraries, bleeding edge very often.
Besides, Paul Davis is a very experienced programmer who I have
very much trouble seeing as a person who would re-implement something
unnecessarily.
