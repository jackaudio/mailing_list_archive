&gt;Good catch. In my experience, Ardour's manual isn't always up-to-date.
&gt;NIH is definitely not something I think of about when Ardour is mentioned.
I&gt;t has always used lots of 3rd party libraries, bleeding edge very often.
&gt;Besides, Paul Davis is a very experienced programmer who I have
&gt;very much trouble seeing as a person who would re-implement something
&gt;unnecessarily.

Thank you for sharing your perception on that! I phrased that poorly- I
didn't mean to ask so much whether JamRouter had been dismissed out of hand,
I meant to figure out whether it may have been evaluated but dismissed for
some kind of development process related reason.

From your answer and the other information in this thread I am drawing a
tentative conclusion that JamRouter has not been evaluated yet by the Jack
community, most likely because it is a late arrival[1], there is an existing
solution, and the likely presence of other pressing issues.

[1] it was mostly developed in 2008 as part of phasex, but is only
standalone since 2015
