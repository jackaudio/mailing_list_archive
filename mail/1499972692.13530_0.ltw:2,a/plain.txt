Thank you for sharing your perception on that! I phrased that poorly- I
didn't mean to ask so much whether JamRouter had been dismissed out of hand,
I meant to figure out whether it may have been evaluated but dismissed for
some kind of development process related reason.

From your answer and the other information in this thread I am drawing a
tentative conclusion that JamRouter has not been evaluated yet by the Jack
community, most likely because it is a late arrival[1], there is an existing
solution, and the likely presence of other pressing issues.

[1] it was mostly developed in 2008 as part of phasex, but is only
standalone since 2015
