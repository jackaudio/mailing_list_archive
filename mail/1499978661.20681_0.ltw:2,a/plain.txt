I think you cannot dismiss lack of promotion also.  Until JamRouter was
mentioned on this mailing list, I do not remember hearing of it before,
and I try to at least briefly read all messages to linux audio users and
jack-devel lists.  If the JamRouter author posted a message describing
JamRouter to either of those lists I do not remember seeing it.  No one
will evaluate new software if no one hears of the new software.
