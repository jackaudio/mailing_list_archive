Unfortunately, the author of JamRouter and Phasex has been "missing" for
some time. By missing I mean absent from the Internet. He also disappeared
in the past, then re-emerged for a brief time when he announced updates to
Phasex and apparently pushed JamRouter to github. Then he promptly
disappeared again. In the process, he left Phasex in a somewhat broken
state and has since stopped responding to issues in github or other
attempts at communication.

So keep in mind that code in his repos is apparently at this point in time
largely abandonware unless someone forks and continues development.

&gt; &gt;JamRouter to either of those lists I do not remember seeing it.  No one

&gt; Ah yes, build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your
&gt; door. But it might take years.
&gt;
&gt; The same might go for the GTK phasex synth by the same author that's been
&gt; around and had accurate MIDI since 2008, as mentioned above. Sounds like
&gt; all
&gt; the synths on this track except the leads, which are hardware (Virus).

&gt; No distribution packages but builds fine and looks beasty.
