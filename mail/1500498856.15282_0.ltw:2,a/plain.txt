Eventually that did it! At first I replied to this email saying that it 
partially worked since jack was starting but no sound was coming out. 
Eventually the latter happened due to some (probably) bug in Pd which I 
"solved" with a work around.
So now I can safely say that adding "DISPLAY=:0 before calling jackd did 
the trick and now I do get sound on boot.

Thanks everyone for your suggestions!
