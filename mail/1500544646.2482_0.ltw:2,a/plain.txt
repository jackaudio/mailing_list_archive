I'm not going to disagree with you, but your distaste is directed at the
wrong list. Jack2 uses dbus to cooperate with pulseaudio so that they can
co-exist on the same machine. And while I'd personally rather run jack by
itself, pulseaudio unfortunately seems to be a requirement for eg.
bluetooth audio on linux at present.
