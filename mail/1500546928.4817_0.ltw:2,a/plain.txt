The logic "(that) D-Bus (requires the display) ... seems fair, given 
that d-bus stands for _Desktop Bus_" is actually incorrect. The only 
connection of DBus to X is that DBus for some reason can auto-launch X. 
Only bin/dbus-launch is linked to libX11.so. DBus is the desktop bus in 
the name only. DBus is an IPC mechanism, and essentially has nothing to 
do with X. In fact, removing --with-x in DBus makes it disconnect from 
X. The fact that any DBus-linked program requires X indicates some 
problem. This should never happen.
