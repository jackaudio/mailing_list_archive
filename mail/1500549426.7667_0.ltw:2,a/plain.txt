DBus relies on a known address for the clients to communicate on. If an
address is not specified it will automatically derive a unix socket based
on the DISPLAY environment variable (if set). Presumably setting
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS explicitly would also suffice as a workaround,
it's just more typing and more arcane.

ie. Jack doesn't require X under any circumstances, but if compiled with
dbus support it _does_ require a valid session bus to connect to and the
simplest way to arrange for that to happen is to set DISPLAY.
