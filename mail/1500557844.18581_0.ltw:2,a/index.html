&gt;&gt; The logic "(that) D-Bus (requires the display) ... seems fair, given
&gt;&gt; that d-bus stands for _Desktop Bus_" is actually incorrect. The only
&gt;&gt; connection of DBus to X is that DBus for some reason can auto-launch X.
&gt;&gt; Only
&gt;&gt; bin/dbus-launch is linked to libX11.so. DBus is the desktop bus in the
&gt;&gt; name only. DBus is an IPC mechanism, and essentially has nothing to do
&gt;&gt; with X. In fact, removing --with-x in DBus makes it disconnect from X.
&gt;&gt; The fact
&gt;&gt; that any DBus-linked program requires X indicates some problem. This
&gt;&gt; should never happen.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; DBus relies on a known address for the clients to communicate on. If an
&gt; address is not specified it will automatically derive a unix socket based
&gt; on the DISPLAY environment variable (if set). Presumably setting
&gt; DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS explicitly would also suffice as a workaround,
&gt; it's just more typing and more arcane.
&gt;
&gt; ie. Jack doesn't require X under any circumstances, but if compiled with
&gt; dbus support it _does_ require a valid session bus to connect to and the
&gt; simplest way to arrange for that to happen is to set DISPLAY.

I wondered if jackd could proceed as if there was no DBus support compiled
in, once it fails to connect to it. That would silently solve such issues.
