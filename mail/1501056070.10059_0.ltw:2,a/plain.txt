This seems like a leftover that nobody cared too much about just yet.
Quickly going through the driver code I see that portaudio and coreaudio 
drivers have this restriction when starting up jackd, but alsa has that 
part disabled.
See 
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack1/blob/cb654ada4ecfd6a95b9fb648ebd33c5af462d380/drivers/alsa/alsa_driver.c#L495

The OSS code does not seem to have this restriction when starting jackd 
either.

So I think we can remove this for at least ALSA and OSS drivers, 
allowing them to change buffer size.
