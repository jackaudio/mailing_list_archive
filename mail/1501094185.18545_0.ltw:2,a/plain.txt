Just put some buffering between the jack callback and the codec.
You will need this anyway, as you can't assume that the codec and
whatever is at the other end of the codec (file, network,...) is
real-time safe. In practice you can be pretty sure it won't be.
 
Jack is typically used to interconnect a soundcard and any number
of applications. What if two applications have different preferred
frame sizes ? Which one should win and impose its choice on all
the others ? Forcing Jack to use a frame size required by any
app is not a practical solution except in some trivial cases,
e.g. when the app is the only one using Jack.
