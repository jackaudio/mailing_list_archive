Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Cannot combine audio devices with more than 64 channels

This is months old, but I have news to this topic.

The suggested changes work and we have set up 11x16channel audio
monitors. That is 176 speakers!

However, running Jack is highly unstable, it crashes roughly every two
minutes and causes a huge amount of XRuns even at buffer sizes like
16000. CPU is down at 5%, so that is not the issue. Jack runs without a
problem when using just one card. However, we need to combine the three
MADI-Cards via .asoundrc in order to eventually get to 768 channels.

I have the jack logs here: https://pastebin.com/ke25cdXB

Do you have any idea what could cause the issue?

Best, Jörg
