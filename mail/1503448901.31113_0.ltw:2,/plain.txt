Quick search through the Jack code shows that this message results from 
Jack attempting to be helpful that ends up being unhelpful:

...

#define    ENOSPC        28        /* No space left on device */


You have a 'disk-full' condition. This most likely has nothing to do 
with having "too many servers already active".

Jack needs to use strerror() instead.
