&gt;
&gt; In general that should be the case.  When clients are too slow in
&gt; processing you will sometimes see jackd messages about removing
&gt; "zombified" clients.
&gt; The behavior you described seems like jackd for some reason was processing
&gt; the buffers as if the client app was still filling the buffers with new
&gt; data, when in fact it had not.
&gt;
&gt; I think the original message said that jackd kept playing old audio. If it
&gt; was just jack playing out the buffers with old data I would expect at most
&gt; maybe 30 ms of audio (e.g. 512 samples per period, 3 periods, 48k
&gt; samples/second) which would not really be recognizable audio.  Was that
&gt; what was meant by playing back old audio, or did it mean a recognizable
&gt; section of audio, like 250 ms or more?  In that case I would suspect the
&gt; application was mismanaging the buffers in some way.

As a note aside: I had the Aeolus/jackd combination occasionally getting
stuck and just producing noise semipermanently.  It might have been
because I was running 32-bit applications on 64-bit kernel: ALSA passes
structures into system calls that are different in size for 32-bit and
64-bit code and does no conversions to make them fit.  It's a wonder
that the application usually worked.  Until it didn't, of course.  I was
running a 64-bit Jackd however.
