As a note aside: I had the Aeolus/jackd combination occasionally getting
stuck and just producing noise semipermanently.  It might have been
because I was running 32-bit applications on 64-bit kernel: ALSA passes
structures into system calls that are different in size for 32-bit and
64-bit code and does no conversions to make them fit.  It's a wonder
that the application usually worked.  Until it didn't, of course.  I was
running a 64-bit Jackd however.
