&gt; &gt; Sorry, but you are completely wrong. It's Jack that doesn't clean up&gt; after the failed clients that is a problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; So far this is only your diagnosis and it's backed up by very little evidence.
&gt; You haven't provided us with information about the real symptoms -
&gt; "old audio" is a pretty broad description. Are we talking about the amount
&gt; of audio data that gets processed in one jack process callback (as Chris Claude
&gt; wrote, that would be sample-rate / (n-periods * buffer-size) ). I doubt you can
&gt; even hear this. For anything longer, I think your diagnosis is off. Where should
&gt; those sample came from? Who would be filling the shared memory buffers?
&gt; I think for any serious debugging you need to provide us with better symptom
&gt; descriptions. For example, as Ralf already did notice, sending an interrupt signal
&gt; to a process doesn't mean that that process dies an instant death. The process could
&gt; have installed a signal handler that performs, a graceful fade-out. Also, you wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This particluar application, sclang, doesn't quit by itself without
&gt; &gt; Ctrl-C, if this isn't encoded in the script.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you now that sclang is not a jack (audio) client, it's only an interpreter that
&gt; controls the supercollider server process (scsynth or supernova) by means of OSC
&gt; messages. You either need to send the server a stop message or kill it.
&gt; &gt; Sorry, but you are completely wrong. It's Jack that doesn't clean up&gt; after the failed clients that is a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you describe what you would expect as a "clean up? AFAIK jackd plays the
&gt; last filled buffer, then detects that the client fails to fill the buffers and "zombifies"
&gt; (read: kills) the client - unless you told the server not to! Did you? Or did you crank up
&gt; the client timeout?
&gt; 
&gt;  Cheers, Ralf Mattes
