I can tell you with certainty that no SC server keeps running. The 
testcase causing this problem creates its own server, see it below.

I also observed the problem with other clients.

---testcase---

s = Server.local;
s.boot;

(
   s.waitForBoot{
     (
       play(
         {
           SinOsc.ar(
             freq: 1000
           )
         }
       );
       s.record(path: 
"/home/yuri/proj/app-stable-working/gui-sound/out-xxx.wav", numChannels: 1);
       3.wait;
       s.stopRecording;
     )
