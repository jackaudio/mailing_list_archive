It doesn't matter.  There is no point in Jackd being dependent on other
applications' behavior for sensible behavior of its own, most
particularly not on particular procedures for their termination.  Unless
they have explicitly set up actions to be taken after their termination
(connecting Jack ports may count among that set: it might be an idea to
require applications to mark its connections explicitly if it wants them
to stay around after finishing, like jack_connect obviously would),
Jackd should just revert to a "virgin" state when they terminate.

You know: mixers that start with a _huuuuuge_ switch-on bump blowing out
the bass speakers and waking all the neighbors are badly designed.  Yes,
one can work even with badly designed equipment, but there is no real
necessity of making Jack badly designed for educational purposes.

A "killall" is an emergency switch.  You'll still get that bass bump if
your mixer sucks.

The power supplies give out in order of their buffering capacities even
when the emergency switch is wired to everything at once.
