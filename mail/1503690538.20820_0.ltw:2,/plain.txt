Client death is not "all kind of protection measures".  It is a
completely basic condition that needs to be recognized and dealt with
sensibly.

Now "client hangs in unkillable state due to a driver giving out" is the
kind of condition that is hard to detect reliably and cater for.  I
don't expect Jackd to go out of its depth to detect this condition
specifically.  But it falls under the general "client stopped talking to
me" category that Jackd needs to be able to deal with even if it has to
consider "but it might start talking again eventually".

But "client died" is something that should confuse Jackd only under most
exceptional circumstances.

So you insist that Jackd should be badly designed with regard to client
death, as a disciplinary measure?

I think our time is better spent improving Jackd rather than improving
Yuri.  Because improving Jackd will help a lot of users while improving
Yuri will only help a single one.
