I'm using ALSA's jack plugin to route sound from a web browser
to Jack. This works OK, but when using the back arrow in the 
browser (i.e. terminating the web page that provided the sound)
the last buffer will be repeated for a time apparently equal
to Jack's timeout. The client that terminates in a not so
clean way in this case is ALSA's Jack plugin. This is easy
to reproduce.
