There is a timeout parameter you can pass to jackd to specify how long the
server waits for a slow client application.  The default is 500ms, does
that correspond to how long the audio keeps playing?
There is also a parameter which can be passed to the jackd server to
prevent the server from disconnecting slow clients.

I do not know how to check the compiled defaults to see if they have been
changed.  The default should result in a crashed application being
disconnected after half a second, you could change, for example try -t 50
to change the timeout to 50 milliseconds to see if that improves the
behavior.
There is also a -v option to cause more verbose messages, could help
determine what the jackd server detects the application state at the time
of stopping.
