This discussion goes crazy...

Do you hear this looping buffer as Fons described? So we are taking about the application output buffers right?

Then I would advice to look at the code that gives the buffers to the client, that is following the jack_port_get_buffer function code path, and see where (probably…) a simple « memset(buffer, 0,…) call has to be added at the appropriate place.
