Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Pd v. Jack2: can't connect named semaphore name

So, I'm trying to package Pure Data for the OpenPandora, however when
trying to connect a running jack2 instance I get:

Connect: can't connect named semaphore name =
jack_sem.1000_default_system err = No such file or directory


On the jack side I see:

Jack: JackRequest::ClientCheck
Jack: Check protocol client = 8 server = 8
Jack: JackRequest::ClientOpen
Jack: JackEngine::ClientExternalOpen: uuid = 18, name = pure_data
Jack: JackEngine::AllocateRefNum ref = 5
Jack: JackLinuxFutex::Allocate name = jack_sem.1000_default_pure_data val = 0
Jack: JackSocketNotifyChannel::Open name = pure_data
Jack: JackClientSocket::Connect : addr.sun_path /dev/shm/jack_pure_data_1000_0
Jack: JackShmMem::new index = 5 attached = 40c47000 size = 432
Jack: JackExternalClient::Open name = pure_data index = 5 base = 40c47000
Jack: JackPosixProcessSync::TimedWait time out = 5000000
Jack: JackPosixProcessSync::TimedWait finished delta = 3112.0
Jack: JackEngine::NotifyAddClient: name = pure_data
Jack: JackDriver::ClientNotify ref = 5 driver = system name =
pure_data notify = 0
Jack: JackExternalClient::ClientNotify ref = 0 client = pure_data name
= system notify = 0
ClientNotify fails name = system notification = 0 val1 = 0 val2 = 0
NotifyAddClient new_client fails name = pure_data
Cannot notify add client
Jack: JackExternalClient::Close
Jack: JackSocketNotifyChannel::Close
Jack: JackClientSocket::Close
Jack: JackShmMem::delete size = 0 index = 5
Cannot create new client
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 1 fd = 11
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 2 fd = 14
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 3 fd = 17
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 4 fd = 20
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : fPollTable i = 5 fd = 23
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::Execute : poll client error err = Success
Jack: JackSocketServerChannel::ClientKill ref = -1 fd = 23
Jack: Client was not opened : probably correspond to server_check


Clearly the two are seeing each other, but I can't tell what is going
wrong here. Any clues on how to proceed are welcome.


cheers,
d.
