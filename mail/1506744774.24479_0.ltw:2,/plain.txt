Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] AES67 / SMPTE ST 2110-30

I read more negative messages about MOTU.  I use an Focusrite 18i20
extended with a Scarllett Octpore over ADAT with WORD or ADAT clock for 16
channels under Ubuntu 17.04 with great working ALSA mixer using sample
rates from 44.1 to 96 Khz. (though with high USB latency).  Planning to get
a Rednet 3 (DANTE) and if this would/should work with this solution I would
be very exited and definitely consider to get one sooner as planned.  My
switch supports IGMPv2 multicast. (Cisco 2960G8-TCL).  I am familiar with
Linux coding but don't know how to recompile ALSA and install/upgrade it to
test on an existing kernel.  A 210 card  I can get easily. There are some
different I210 card versions it seems, any recommendations ? Coding wise,
I  wish to find time to support the FR Scarlett Gen 2 ALSA mixer on Linux
as a lot of people want it due to it's much low USB latency.
Thanks
