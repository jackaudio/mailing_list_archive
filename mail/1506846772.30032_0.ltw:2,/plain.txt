Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] AES67 / SMPTE ST 2110-30

A few years back there had been a AES67/Ravenna implementation. But the 
developer and ALX Networks could not agree on the license. The developer 
wanted to publish it under GPL, which ALX Networks did not want. So the 
implementation was dumped. Well, that is the story how I know it.
The developer was Florian Faber, but he is no member of the jack-devel 
or linux-devel list anymore. Perhapes, he might have some useful 
insights, if you manage to find a contact. ;-)

They are all ok. I have different versions myself: Intel I210, HP 
I210TI. But make shure it is no I217, because they have no traffic 
shaping queues. Although they suport HW PTP timestamping.
