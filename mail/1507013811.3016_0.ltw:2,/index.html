I am considering to get a pair of these. Intel Ethernet Server Adapter
I210T1, single port PCI-e (with 802.1qav support).

&gt; Thanks all for these helpful comments!
&gt; I&#x2019;ve been studying the last days, and I am studying more.
&gt;
&gt; I downloaded merging technologies free AES67 virtual sound card for mac
&gt; already, as well as the Dante Via from audinate (59USD). The latter is also
&gt; capable of functioning as a master clock on the network I understand. That
&gt; will do for the testing and development at this time. Thanks for the many
&gt; other suggestions you made. The gear I found before was more expensive
&gt; (e.g. digigram has a -very well reputed- ravenna sound card with linux
&gt; support for about 2K).
&gt;
&gt; There is indeed a Ravenna reference implementation with linux support by
&gt; ALC NetworX. I&#x2019;m waiting for information regarding conditions for
&gt; obtaining, using, distributing it. I&#x2019;m also in contact with people at
&gt; Merging regarding their VSC driver in progress for Linux.
&gt;
&gt; I contacted audinate regarding AES67 patent claims.
&gt;
&gt; As said, I&#x2019;m not really considering implementing AES67 as a virtual sound
&gt; card driver - I prefer to stay clear of kernel space development. Instead,
&gt; Im aiming for a jack client application, and perhaps a jack audio driver
&gt; (like the net drivers). The latter allow to have jack running at AES67
&gt; clock, and being fully transparent (no sample rate conversion). But the
&gt; former, a client application, is probably better if you just want to
&gt; receive and monitor / send AES67 on / from a computer having a sound card
&gt; already.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks also for the hint about the zita resampler library.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x2019;m keeping you informed about progress and findings.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt;
&gt; Philippe.

&gt; &gt; A few years back there had been a AES67/Ravenna implementation. But the
&gt; developer and ALX Networks could not agree on the license. The developer
&gt; wanted to publish it under GPL, which ALX Networks did not want. So the
&gt; implementation was dumped. Well, that is the story how I know it.
&gt; &gt; The developer was Florian Faber, but he is no member of the jack-devel
&gt; or linux-devel list anymore. Perhapes, he might have some useful insights,
&gt; if you manage to find a contact. ;-)
