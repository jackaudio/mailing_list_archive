Bugger, according to this, the I210T1 requires a PCI 2.1 slot. Mine is just
a 2.0.
https://communities.intel.com/thread/108269. The Intel I210T1 spec states
"The interface only supports the PCIe v2.1 (2.5GT/s) rate and is configured
to x1."
So, this seems to be a showstopper. Most new MB are already PCI Gen 3, like
this
https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/Z77AG45_Thunderbolt/Specification,
So if it ONLY supports PCI 2.1 ... (?) Would the card work on 2.0 and 3.0 ?
