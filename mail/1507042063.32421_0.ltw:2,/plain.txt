The correct link for linuxptp seems to be
http://linuxptp.sourceforge.net

Anyways, happy musicmaker : you may just want to try first with your current network adapter lacking hardware time stamping. 
ptpd reports clock synchronisation accuracy in the order of microseconds. 
Others report up to 100 microseconds accuracy in absense of hardware time stamping and on a loaded network.
Thats still only 5 audio samples and the latency of your audio card is probably a lot larger than that (miliseconds at least).
You’re probably not doing highly time critical work either.
No need to rush for that (web) shop right away …

Best,

Philippe.
