For what gives, and perhaps even not useful for this and more for AVB, but
ordered two I210T1 each $44 from Amazon just for testing peer to peer.  My
plan is still a Rednet 3 as I see it the only option for Linux now  to
create a multi-channel network for the studio with the current ADAT's
DAC/ADCs's on hand. (Don't see Thunderbolt happening to become mainstream
on Windows and for Linux perhaps it will never happen)  I am not sure what
AES67 FR implemented in the Red-net 3 firmware (Bonjour or any other
discovery protocol). Still learning and reading lots of AE67 material and
you-tube got some good video's as well.

&gt; &gt; I&#x2019;m also in contact with people at

&gt;
&gt; Did you get a copy of the ALSA driver?  The current git head does not
&gt; compile, I waited to see if merging would correct that on their own, but
&gt; still not corrected after a month, so I need to ask what is happening
&gt; there.  Not encouraging that it is actually getting any attention if the
&gt; source can go more than a month in a non-buildable state.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm aiming for a jack client application, and perhaps a jack audio driver
&gt; &gt; (like the net drivers). The latter allow to have jack running at AES67
&gt; &gt; clock, and being fully transparent (no sample rate conversion). But the
&gt; &gt; former, a client application, is probably better if you just want to
&gt; &gt; receive and monitor / send AES67 on / from a computer having a sound card
&gt; &gt; already.
&gt;
&gt; I recommend a jack audio driver.  If you want to monitor from a local
&gt; sound card you can always load zita-j2a and zita-a2j resampling bridges,
&gt; that work has been done so no need to implement twice what Fons has
&gt; already implemented.  The advantages of a net driver is that you can in
&gt; principle collect streams from different devices that are in the same
&gt; clock domain and have a large virtual sound card.  For example, in a home
&gt; recording environment you could have a Ravenna output device in your room
&gt; with a computer, have a Ravenna in/out device in a different room with
&gt; someone playing keyboards, and a Ravenna in/out device in the house large
&gt; room playing guitar, and all three of those physically separated devices
&gt; could be treated as one large audio interface.
&gt; I am not sure if jackd will let a driver load and then change the number
&gt; of ports at a later time, so how configuration would work is a task that
&gt; needs to be investigated early (e.g. would you have to discover and
&gt; configure Ravenna streams first, then load the net driver, or could the
&gt; net driver be loaded with some arbitrary number of ports declared to
&gt; jackd, and various Ravenna streams connected and disconnected from those
&gt; declared ports at run time).
&gt;
&gt; I am still struggling to find reasonable cost network connected
&gt; interfaces.  The small device from Hasseb I linked last time is reasonable
&gt; cost, but very low feature, I would prefer at least a duplex stereo
&gt; device.  Focusrite have a new two channel Dante device which could run in
&gt; AES67 mode, but it is output only, and I think is around US$400.  The 4
&gt; input 2 output Cymatic device is still not available yet, and even though
&gt; the 24 channel Cymatic device has reduced price by 50% lately, that is the
&gt; base USB version only, so by the time you purchase the Ravenna option card
&gt; it is still around US$1000.  Not a bad price for 24 channels, but still
&gt; could be considered quite a lot to spend on a hobby investigation project.
&gt;
&gt; If a Windows computer is available, the Lawo R3lay virtual sound card for
&gt; Windows is the best option to get started.  I tried it and was able to
&gt; send audio between two Windows laptops.  You will need a PTP master on the
&gt; network, that VSC will not act as clock master, but I am running a
&gt; BeagleBone Black as PTP master (uses chronyd to sync time to ntp, then
&gt; provides the ntp time to the network using linuxptp).  You could also use
&gt; your existing linux machine to act at PTP master, it would just have more
&gt; jitter in the PTP performance if you do not have hardware timestamping
&gt; capability (the BeagleBone has hardware timestamp in the MAC layer but not
&gt; the phy, not ideal but still fairly high performance).
