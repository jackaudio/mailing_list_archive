For what gives, and perhaps even not useful for this and more for AVB, but
ordered two I210T1 each $44 from Amazon just for testing peer to peer.  My
plan is still a Rednet 3 as I see it the only option for Linux now  to
create a multi-channel network for the studio with the current ADAT's
DAC/ADCs's on hand. (Don't see Thunderbolt happening to become mainstream
on Windows and for Linux perhaps it will never happen)  I am not sure what
AES67 FR implemented in the Red-net 3 firmware (Bonjour or any other
discovery protocol). Still learning and reading lots of AE67 material and
you-tube got some good video's as well.
