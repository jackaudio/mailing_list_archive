Keep in mind that Dante was originally using a different clocking scheme,
so original Dante protocol is not compatible with AES67, only the new
updated protocol.  Make sure that the new AES67 firmware is available for
Rednet 3 before you buy.

Not sure what you were meaning by "FR," but AES67 essentially gave up on
discovery, you have to use external means to configure the different
devices.  Basically AES67 just describes the least common denominator of
several different network protocols, there is no device which has "native"
AES67 if you will, but you can configure a Ravenna device to use only the
subset of features covered in  AES67, configure a Dante device to use the
subset of features covered in AES67, and then configure the two devices
with the network addresses and ports to find each other and they can
exchange data.
