In this case it's Ardour (not JACK) that sets the port latencies. I
guess you use Ardour5 which [wrongly] always reports the worst-case latency.

I guess you use alsa_in or zita-aj2 for port "B", the latter tool has
options to set additional systemic latencies.

Just forcing the values to some different number won't help you.
You could add a jack-client in-between that delays the signal and sets
port-latencies to include the delay.
Or wait for Ardour6 which already does this, but but at this point in
time is still far from a release, and the session format is not stable)
