Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] questions about latency ranges

I still don't understand what's happening on the OP example. If both A 
and B are connected to C, you really should be getting capture latency 
of [ 337 867 ] there.

I created a quick test setup:

$ jackd -d dummy -r 48000 -p 2048 -C 0 -P 1 &
$ jack_lset -n source1 --capture 337 &
$ jack_lset -n source2 --capture 867 &
$ jack_connect source2:output_1 system:playback_1
$ jack_connect source1:output_1 system:playback_1
$ jack_lsp -l
system:playback_1
	port latency = 4096 frames
	port playback latency = [ 4096 4096 ] frames
	port capture latency = [ 337 867 ] frames
source1:output_1
	port latency = 0 frames
	port playback latency = [ 4096 4096 ] frames
	port capture latency = [ 337 337 ] frames
source2:output_1
	port latency = 0 frames
	port playback latency = [ 4096 4096 ] frames
	port capture latency = [ 867 867 ] frames

JACK should always set the minimum value of the pair to the minimum 
among its connected ports, not set both values to the maximum. Am I 
missing something here?

(shameless self-citation) I made jack_lsync that does this, both 
jack_lset and jack_lsync can be found in:
