Ok, then it's an Ardour issue. There are actually several opportunities to 
mess things up when reimplementing jack's latency propagation algorithm in a 
client's latency callback. What do you think about making jack's original 
algorithm available to the client such that a client's latency callback (e.g., 
for adding 100 frames of latency) could be something like

void latency_callback(jack_latency_callback_mode_t mode, void *arg)
{
	jack_latency_range_t range;
	jack_port_compute_latency_range(port, mode, &range);  // new
	range.min += 100;
	range.max += 100;
	jack_port_set_latency_range(port, mode, &range);
}

I guess this could be useful in many cases when a client needs its own latency 
callback.

Yes (as I stated before), and the systemic latencies are set to the values 
reported by Jack_delay (http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio).

Interesting, I will at least have a look at this.

	Thanks & kind regards,
