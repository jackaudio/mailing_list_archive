Excellent, I was just starting to implement a similar tool myself, you saved 
me a lot of work! Dropping in two instances of your client in the capture and 
playback path precisely aligns the round-trip pulses in my Ardour test setup 
(even in the pathological case that both signals are recorded into the same 
track).

I vote for adding these tools to the Jack example clients. What do you think 
about this?

BTW, one question regarding the "coefficient" parameter: I thought this should 
always be "1" (align to maximum latency), but didn't notice any difference 
when leaving its default value 0.5 (align to center), both variants gave 
correct results. How does this coefficient affect the behaviour of your client?

	Thanks & kind regards,
		Markus
