&gt; &gt; I vote for adding these tools to the Jack example clients. What do you
&gt; &gt; think about this?
&gt; 
&gt; It'd be nice if they also supported synchronizing MIDI ports, but that's
&gt; TODO for now. For the rest, IMO they're pretty much ready to go.
I agree, MIDI would be nice to have, but the tools would be a useful addition 
even without MIDI support. Any opinions of other Jack developers on this?

&gt; &gt; BTW, one question regarding the "coefficient" parameter: I thought this
&gt; &gt; should always be "1" (align to maximum latency), but didn't notice any
&gt; &gt; difference when leaving its default value 0.5 (align to center), both
&gt; &gt; variants gave correct results. How does this coefficient affect the
&gt; &gt; behaviour of your client?
&gt; The coefficient has no effect when all ports' input latency has the same
&gt; minimum and maximum (i.e. one port [ 337 337 ] and the other [ 867 867
&gt; ]). That's expected most of the time.
&gt; 
&gt; If one port had [ 523 1024 ] latency you'd probably be doing it wrong,
&gt; but jack_lsync still has to deal with it, and that's what the parameter
&gt; is for. If coefficient was 0, lsync would assume 523 latency when
&gt; calculating the delays to apply, if it's 1 it'll assume 1024, and if
&gt; it's the default it'll just take the mean of min &amp; max, and assume 773.
&gt; 
&gt; So it's only there for those strange cases that should ideally never happen.
Ok, a device not knowing exactly its own latency is indeed odd. Thanks for the 
explanation!

&gt; PS: If you want to use alsa_out or alsa_in, note this bug which may make
&gt; them report wrong playback/capture latencies in some cases
&gt; https://github.com/jackaudio/tools/pull/8
Thanks for the hint, but due to another self-citation :-) a while ago by Fons 
Adriaensen, I ended up using Zita-ajbridge (http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/
linuxaudio/zita-ajbridge-doc/quickguide.html), which works very well for me.

	Kind regards,
		Markus
