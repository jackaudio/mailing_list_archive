I agree, MIDI would be nice to have, but the tools would be a useful addition 
even without MIDI support. Any opinions of other Jack developers on this?

Ok, a device not knowing exactly its own latency is indeed odd. Thanks for the 
explanation!

Thanks for the hint, but due to another self-citation :-) a while ago by Fons 
Adriaensen, I ended up using Zita-ajbridge (http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/
linuxaudio/zita-ajbridge-doc/quickguide.html), which works very well for me.

	Kind regards,
