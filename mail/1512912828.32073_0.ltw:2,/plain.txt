The windows versions of Radium has included a custom version of jack 1.9.12
since october. If you want to manually upgrade jack on your windows
machine, it might work just to replace the old jack files with the one
included in Radium. As I've expressed before, the installer should be
removed, and jack should be installed locally for all programs wanting to
use it. This will not break any programs. Radium partly does this already.
Radium first checks if Jack is installed globally, and if not, it uses the
version of jack installed in the "jack_local" directory. But for this to
work properly with more than one client, jack needs to inform where the
currently used libraries are placed so that different clients aren't using
different versions of the jack libraries.
