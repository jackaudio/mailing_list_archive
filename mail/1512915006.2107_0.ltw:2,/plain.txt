And to clarify some more: The only difference for the user compared to the
current situation, is that the user doesn't have to install jack. If the
user wants to upgrade jack, the user only have to download the latest
version of qjackctl (or similar software). Normal clients doesn't have to
include the jack libraries, only programs that wants to start the server
have to include the jack libraries.
