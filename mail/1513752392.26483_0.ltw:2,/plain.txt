Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] AES67 / SMPTE ST 2110-30

Just received two of these (HP) I-210 "PCI 2.1" cards (from Amazon). 
Installed one of them in and old PC with a PCI-e 2.0 x 4 slot (thus only 
using part of the slot). Initially windows reported an error and it did 
not work. Went back to Ubuntu 17.10 on the same machine and it worked 
fine. (Same result as another person before me). Disabled the internal 
NIC and started Windows again. Voila, it worked ! Re-enabled the 
on-board NIC and it kept Working in windows. Just for reference.  Don't 
have a AVB audio device so cannot really test them. Looking if there is 
any AVB test software out there to use these two cards to transmit AVB 
based audio from one to the other.

 From talking to Focusrite regarding AES67 and the Rednet series and 
firmware support, got the following:  "With regards to AES67 
compatibility, this is possible for devices using the 'Brooklyn 2' Dante 
chipset. RedNet 3s ship with a 'Brooklyn 1' chipset, though it's 
possible to upgrade to a Brooklyn 2 (this would be chargeable). All of 
our devices using Brooklyn 2 modules have AES67 compliance following the 
latest firmware update available from RedNet Control"  (Focusrite 
Rednets use the Bonjour/mDNS protocol for discovery)

In conclusion, the 3 parts needed for full functionality on Linux
[1] Discovery - mDNS should be doable in Linux, right ?
[2] AoIP  / clocking - This AES67 project
[3] Control (of the device) - Windows/Mac for the moment. Hopefully 
suppliers will support some kind of new standard in the future for that 
as well ( HTML XML, JSON  or other open messaging over IP to configure 
the unit). The Rednet3 will keep the routing/configuration after power 
cycling thus until then that should be done under Windows.

Looking forward on the progress  of this project !
