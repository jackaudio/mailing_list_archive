Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Installing Jack on my Mac High Sierra

Using the following instructions to install Jack:
https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/advanced-audio-capture-mac-os-x.142/
When I get to step 4, there is no JackRouter choice listed in System
preferences/Sound/Output and select JackRouter. Do the same for input.

What do you suggest I do in order to complete the installation and
operation of Jack on my Mac in order to have game sounds and live
commentary as I stream games.

Thank you,

stoicmom
