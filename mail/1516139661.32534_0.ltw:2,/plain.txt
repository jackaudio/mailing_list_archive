It will just track the drift and compensate for it.

You don't need to, no two sound cards will have exactly the
same sample rate if they are not synced.

The simple way to test ajbridge is to measure the delay
of a loop through both soundcards, using e.g. jack_delay.

There are some test results in the LAC paper as well.
