You seem to be wanting to write a JACK client, right?

The "jack/control.h" header is meant for implementing JACK server
control utilities. Those are specific to the JACK implementation you're
running on your system and thus differ between JACK1 and JACK2.

That header is not menat to be included by JACK client applications.

So, don't include that header and don't use any functions in it for
writing a JACK client. Include the "jack/jack.h" header instead, that's
the one with all the API calls for JACK clients.

Best start off with the simple_client [1] to get a minmal working example.
