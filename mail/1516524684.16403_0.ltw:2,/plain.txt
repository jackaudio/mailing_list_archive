Thanks for your help. I never really considered going back to jack1 since I
really like C++ and would like to contribute to the project down the road.
Right now, I am more of a beginner and wouldn't be too much help though. So
I get that jack/control.h is not available to jack2? Alright, I guess I will
have to work around that then. Maybe we should seperate the docs between
jack1 and jack2?
