Actually I am writing a server program which should be able to start and
stop a jack server when needed to save resources. Everything basically
revolves around NetJack2 and connecting different Slaves. I just thought it
would be nice to include the function to start a server if the API supports
it. I guess that was the reason QJackCtl used QProcess and started Jack as a
program in its program instead of trying what I did. So some functions work
with Jack2 in jack/control.h? Which ones? And as I suggested in another
reply, maybe we should mention that in the API somewhere, or maybe I missed
it and you could point me to it?

I got that working thankfully! I will work around it for now, thank you
anyways! Finally I can stop doubting my skills and start working on that
project of mine...
