How to measure the delay between two sound cards ?
What does the jack_delay measures, the delay between
what and what ?

Any documentation on how to use the jack_delay for measuring ?

It will just track the drift and compensate for it.

You don't need to, no two sound cards will have exactly the
same sample rate if they are not synced.

The simple way to test ajbridge is to measure the delay
of a loop through both soundcards, using e.g. jack_delay.

There are some test results in the LAC paper as well.
