This is my understanding of your situation, but I have not used RPi for
audio, so if someone who has says differently weight that opinion higher
than mine.

Should be possible, but is getting down to the latency range where you
have to be careful of system configuration.  You may need an RT kernel. 
Some devices require power of 2 sizes, so depending on the audio interface
you may have to choose 32 or 64 rather than 48.

I do not know if the ALSA JACK plugin allows setting higher latency for
the ALSA interface than the jackd settings.  I think Paul has mentioned
that as a limitation before.

Rather than a plugin, you will likely find it easier to develop a stand
along jack application.  The jack design is not really made for having
plugins in the server.
