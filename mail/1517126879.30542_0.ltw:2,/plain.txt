Thank you all for very interesting input, I'll do the DSP in a "regular" jack client to get everything working, and maybe migrate to an internal one later on, if needed.

Now I'll just have to get jack to work at all on my platform (RPi3 + Audioinjector Octocard), having trouble with dbus/X11 as I run Raspbian Stretch headless...

Thank you all again!
