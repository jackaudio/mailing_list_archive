Ok, speaking of which, apparently I need to use jackd2 (http://forum.audioinjector.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=16), but I have no X11 installed, which seems to be needed ?:

pi@AccordPi:~ $ sudo jackd -d alsa

JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10

Failed to connect to session bus for device reservation /usr/bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.

Audio device hw:0 cannot be acquired...
Cannot initialize driver
JackServer::Open failed with -1

Is there a way to get around this ?
