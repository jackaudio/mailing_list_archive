Hi,

I downloaded  ajbridge (zita-ajbridge-0.7.0.tar.bz2 )
&lt;https://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/downloads/zita-ajbridge-0.7.0.tar.bz2&gt;
, resampler version 1.6  and   alsa-pcmi version 0.2.0
and built all successfully.

However while running zita-a2j I got the following error.

$zita-a2j: error while loading shared libraries: libzita-resampler.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

When checked the installation message, it says it installed under /usr/local/lib64

install -d /usr/local/include/zita-resampler
install -d /usr/local/lib64
install -m 644 zita-resampler/resampler.h zita-resampler/resampler-table.h zita-resampler/vresampler.h zita-resampler/cresampler.h /usr/local/include/zita-resampler
install -m 644 libzita-resampler.so.1.6.0 /usr/local/lib64
ln -sf libzita-resampler.so.1.6.0 /usr/local/lib64/libzita-resampler.so
ldconfig

So, I modified the  /etc/ld.so.conf file and added the path for lib64
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/lib64

Then, things started to work.

Now, I connected USB sound card and it shows the sound card as follows,

cat /proc/asound/cards
 0 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH
                      HDA Intel PCH at 0xf7d30000 irq 35
 1 [HD             ]: USB-Audio - USB Sound Blaster HD
                      Creative Technology USB Sound Blaster HD at usb-0000:00:14.0-2, full speed

After starting jack server  using qjackctl, opened terminal and
ran the following cmd

$zita-a2j -d hw:HD  -p 1056  -v

Then in qjackctl connected the graph as shown in the attached picture.
USB sound card input (line-in) is connected to an audio output from other PC.
But I can't hear the audio using zita-j2a.
I mean audio was not heard in PC where zita-j2a is running.

Anything wrong in the connections, how to debug and check why
no audio is heard.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The simple way to test ajbridge is to measure the delay

&gt;&gt; How to measure the delay between two sound cards ?
&gt;&gt; What does the jack_delay measures, the delay between
&gt;&gt; what and what ?
&gt;
&gt; 1. Read available documentation.
&gt; 2. Think.
&gt; 3. If after (1) and (2) some things remain unclear proceed to (4).
&gt; 4. Ask questions on mailing lists.
&gt;
&gt; You have a habit of skipping the first three. That is getting
&gt; on my nerves, and not only on mine.

Well, to be fair it is hard to interpret the results of just trying, and
"available documentation" could be better in many cases.  It's pretty
exhaustive in the case of jack_delay's man page I'll admit (though the
need to differentiate between JACK1 and JACK2 and various behaviors is
really good for a head ache, requiring more of 2. than users might have
readily available, probably hard for an insider to the program to
fathom).

On the LilyPond (batch music typesetter with plain text input language)
user list I often get puzzled at requests of the "can I do this" kind of
questions where one wants to shout "why don't you ask LilyPond?".  Some
people seem more comfortable risking annoying another human rather than
annoying a program.

At least with regard to latencies it is rather tricky to "just try".
