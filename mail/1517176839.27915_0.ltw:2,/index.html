&gt; After starting jack server  using qjackctl

What jack settings were used in qjackctl?  Which driver was chosen, and
which interface?

&gt; Then in qjackctl connected the graph as shown in the attached picture.

That graph works if j2a is controlling the sound card, if jack was started
with the ALSA driver and the USB device as the interface then jackd would
already be controlling the sound card.

When providing information it will save a lot of time if you actually copy
and past the command line you used as well as the resulting messages.  For
example you stated that you started zita-a2j, did you start zita-j2a with
the same command line parameters as zita-a2j?  What status messages were
printed at that time?  What was in the messages window of qjackctl (that
is where the output from the jackd server is displayed)?
You have given about a fourth of the information needed to help you
determine what is happening on your system.
