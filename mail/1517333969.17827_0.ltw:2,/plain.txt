Make sure, that the user which starts jackd is allowed to raise the real
time priority and memlock address space.

See http://jackaudio.org/faq/linux_rt_config.html

Most distributions ship and install a limits.conf snipped file with the
jack package. Here is an example from CentOS/Fedora:

cat /etc/security/limits.d/95-jack.conf

# Default limits for users of jack-audio-connection-kit

@jackuser - rtprio 70
@jackuser - memlock 4194304

In this case, the user has to be in the @jackuser group to be able to
raise the priority.

What error message do you get without sudo? Maybe your user has to be in
the "audio" group (or similar).
