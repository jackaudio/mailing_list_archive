Thanks, I thought it would something like that, Ok I'll have to figure out how to do it on Raspbian.

The error is:
Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory
Cannot connect to server request channel
jack server is not running or cannot be started
JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock
JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock
aplay: main:788: audio open error: No such file or directory

And the "pi" user seems to be in audio group:
> groups
pi adm dialout cdrom sudo audio video plugdev games users input netdev gpio i2c spi

Running with sudo plays audio just fine.
