One important caveat: an often missed bit of information when this configutation is mentioned is the 
fact that this configures the pam_limits PAM module. So: pam needs to be enabled and configured (most
if not all distros do this) and whatever process need these setting needs to gothrough a pam session
or inherit/fork of a process that does. A "normal" login will usually do so but some process started during
bootup or chron or directly started from init/systemd will not. You've been warned ;-)
