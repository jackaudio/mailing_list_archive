&gt;&gt; What I also observed is the fact, that capturing 10 seconds
&gt;&gt; (jack_capture -d 10 ...) directly from the "-d alsa" jackd takes around
&gt;&gt; 40 seconds (real 0m40.457s) vs. 10 seconds (as one would expect) with
&gt;&gt; the "-d dummy" jackd (real 0m10.339s)
&gt;
&gt; That is very strange, the test-arecord.wav and test-jack_capture.wav
&gt; files are the same size, the file captured with jack is not 4 times
&gt; larger.
&gt;

indeed, very strange

&gt; Does that CentOS machine have any attached audio hardware?  If so you
&gt; could use the alsa_out plugin to play the captured audio, for example
&gt; through a USB audio interface, and if that audio path is OK maybe just
&gt; jack_rec or jack_capture is causing the problem.  I'm not sure what other
&gt;  capture programs can run headless and capture from jack, NAMA perhaps?
&gt; Actually I just checked and NAMA uses ecasound as the backend, just use
&gt; ecasound directly, it has jack support.
&gt;
&gt; How did you get the file to play back at 12kHz?  Could you tell if it was
&gt;  really distorted like the capture was mis-packing the original data,
&gt; taking a 32 bit input word, putting just 16 bits of that into the first
&gt; half of a 32 bit word...that only accounts for 2x time, not 4x, and is
&gt; really a stretch, I don't see how an error that egregious could slip
&gt; through jack or jack_capture.  Very strange.
&gt;
i used a hand-crafted non-released player that can do it. it's just
playing the 48k file as if it would be 12k. any resampler could do it. it
was not distorted but i could hear the 's' is degraded. it could be 7.5
bit or something. very strange.
