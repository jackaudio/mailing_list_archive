&gt;&gt; It seems more likely like jack doesn't call the process callback as

&gt; The most likely cause for that would seem to be driver does not interrupt
&gt; as frequently as jackd expects.  A driver for a typical bus connected
&gt; audio device would interrupt whenever there were enough audio samples to
&gt; fill one buffer.
&gt; Do you have source for the LiveWire driver?  I think someone mentioned it
&gt; was a closed binary, is that correct?

Yes, it's a proprietary driver and I don't have access to the source
code. I could contact the vendor and ask if they observed the same or a
similar issue already.
However, I'm wondering what arecord and jackd-dummy/alsa_in are doing
different compared to jackd-alsa.
