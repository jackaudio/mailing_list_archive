Sorry if this is not relevant (I'm not quite following what's happening),
but could
it be that the difference can be explained by different alsa paremeters set
by arecord and jack? Have you tried to run "arecord -L" and find the most
low-level device to record from (which jack probably uses).

For instance by running something like "arecord -D iec958:CARD=M2496,DEV=0"
(my soundcard).

If that is the case, then it's probably the default alsa device that does
something magic
when accessing a more low-level device.
