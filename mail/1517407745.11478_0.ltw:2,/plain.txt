I ran both, arecord and jackd with hw:0 initially. I re-ran the capture
again with "arecord -D default:CARD=Axia ...", which didn't make any
difference (the recording sounds correct).

For the record, here is the ALSA capture PCM and device list:

arecord -L
null
    Discard all samples (playback) or generate zero samples (capture)
default:CARD=Axia
    Axia, Axia PCM
    Default Audio Device
sysdefault:CARD=Axia
    Axia, Axia PCM
    Default Audio Device


arecord -l
