Maybe jack will work if you give it the same parameters that arecord uses.
I.e. compare
the content of  /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/sub0/hw_params (or a similarly
named file)
when running arecord and when running jack.

Also, maybe it works to record in jack if you change audio from "duplex" to
"capture only".
