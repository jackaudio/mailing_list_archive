BINGO and thank you so much for this pointer!

If I start jackd in capture-only mode with only two channels, the
capturing finally works as expected:

jackd -d alsa -d hw:0 -C -i 2

Interestingly, the different period size of 4096 vs. 1024 doesn't seems
to have any impact (I first tried to run with -p 4096 as well).

Below are the HW parameters of the ALSA device, during different states.

# hw_params during arecord
cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/sub0/hw_params

access: RW_INTERLEAVED
format: S32_LE
subformat: STD
channels: 2
rate: 48000 (48000/1)
period_size: 4096
buffer_size: 16384


# hw_params during jackd -d alsa -d hw:0
# jackd -d alsa
cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/sub0/hw_params

access: MMAP_INTERLEAVED
format: S32_LE
subformat: STD
channels: 8
rate: 48000 (48000/1)
period_size: 1024
buffer_size: 2048


# hw_params during jackd -d alsa -d hw:0 -C -i 2
cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/sub0/hw_params

access: MMAP_INTERLEAVED
format: S32_LE
subformat: STD
channels: 2
rate: 48000 (48000/1)
period_size: 1024
buffer_size: 2048



Thank you everyone for your valuable help!
