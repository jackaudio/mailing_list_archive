How does the rc.local start jackd under the user account?  Maybe it could
start a screen session at that point, and when you ssh in you can connect
to the screen session.  If you are not familiar with screen it is an
application that (among other features) will let you disconnect an ssh
session while the underlying terminal session continues to run (usually
breaking the ssh session will kill the terminal session associated with
that login).  When you connect again with ssh you start screen with the -r
argument to restore connection to the already running screen session
rather than starting a new session.
