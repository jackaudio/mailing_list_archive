I don't really feel like going through the effort of creating a new
account on some web site I've never heard of to fix your problem.  If you
would like help on this mailing list then I recommend you send relevant
information to this mailing list.

Not typically.
I found this in common/JackShmMem.cpp:

 jack_log("JackShmMem::delete size = %ld index = %ld", size, info.index);

So it seems like at least some shared memory operations get logged.
Maybe try -v for verbose logging.
