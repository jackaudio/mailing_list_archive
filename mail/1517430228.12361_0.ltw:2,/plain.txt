What i wonder is did you see 8 JACK system:capture ports with the above
configuration? It's still confusing that JACK would attach the device
differently. The factor 4 can probably be explained by 8 / 2 channels (?)
or has it do with duplex?.
It could be that the record just took every 4th sample. But why?

For future reference, this could be issued on github with these detailed
debug informations. It's possible that JACK can't do anything about it if
it's driver related. So.. up to you.
