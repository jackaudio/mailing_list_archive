I had forgotten, but after seeing the answer I remember when this came up
a couple of years ago, systemd proposed this behavior as a security
feature, some subset of users yelled about how it would break their usual
work flow that involved using nohup to keep jobs running in the background
when they logged out, so the behavior was made configurable but "secure by
default."  Obviously not many people make use of the configurability,
because when this comes up it takes a pretty deep google search to stumble
on the answer, seems hardly anyone remembers that systemd cleans out user
processes on exit now by default.

Might not be exactly the same, the article I remembered talks about that
behavior even killing screen, I think that was KillUserProcess instead of
the shared memory setting, but very similar:
https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=systemd-230-KillUserProcesses

I think maybe the jack FAQ needs a section for headless use, it seems
about twice a year some problem comes up and it takes a few days to work
through all the variations of PAM and systemd caveats needed to get jack
working on an appliance style device.
