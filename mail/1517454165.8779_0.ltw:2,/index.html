Can you explain a little more what you mean?  You can keep sample rate
sync using jack, if you also want to keep transport sync then you would
need jack aware applications that support the jack transport API.  Ardour
and Mixbus do, Qtractor, not sure if there are others.  May depend on if
you really mean DAW or if you mean a MIDI sequencer and a DAW, there are a
few sequencers which can be synchronized to jack.

&gt; Cubase and Ableton specifically in my case.

Which OS platform are  you using?  Jack is multi-platform, but was
primarily developed and maintained on linux.  There are Windows and Mac OS
ports, but a lot fewer people are experienced in getting jack working on
those platforms.

Cubase and Ableton I assume could be Windows or Mac OS, neither of those
supports jack natively, so would either treat jack as an ASIO device on
Windows, or a CoreAudio device on Mac OS.  I don't believe either of those
audio API's has a concept of "transport" or musical sync, only digital
audio sync, so you could transfer audio between the applications, but not
position within a musical arrangement or even start and stop.

Jack also transports MIDI, so possibly you could kludge up a way to use
MIDI to synchronize between applications which support MIDI sync, but I'm
just speculating at this point, I don't actually know enough about the
Windows port to know whether that would actually work or not.
