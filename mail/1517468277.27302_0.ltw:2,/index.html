Hey Chris,
Thanks so much for your input.
I'm primarily on Windows, I think you have answered the question,
which would explain why I haven't heard or seen anyone with a setup using
Cubase and Ableton.

I've seen Bidule do some interesting routing but again not exactly what I
am looking for.

If you ever see this setup working please think of me, as it is my dream
setup.

Thanks again for your time much appreciated!

Cheers
Gaz

&gt;
&gt; Can you explain a little more what you mean?  You can keep sample rate
&gt; sync using jack, if you also want to keep transport sync then you would
&gt; need jack aware applications that support the jack transport API.  Ardour
&gt; and Mixbus do, Qtractor, not sure if there are others.  May depend on if
&gt; you really mean DAW or if you mean a MIDI sequencer and a DAW, there are a
&gt; few sequencers which can be synchronized to jack.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Cubase and Ableton specifically in my case.
&gt;
&gt; Which OS platform are  you using?  Jack is multi-platform, but was
&gt; primarily developed and maintained on linux.  There are Windows and Mac OS
&gt; ports, but a lot fewer people are experienced in getting jack working on
&gt; those platforms.
&gt;
&gt; Cubase and Ableton I assume could be Windows or Mac OS, neither of those
&gt; supports jack natively, so would either treat jack as an ASIO device on
&gt; Windows, or a CoreAudio device on Mac OS.  I don't believe either of those
&gt; audio API's has a concept of "transport" or musical sync, only digital
&gt; audio sync, so you could transfer audio between the applications, but not
&gt; position within a musical arrangement or even start and stop.
&gt;
&gt; Jack also transports MIDI, so possibly you could kludge up a way to use
&gt; MIDI to synchronize between applications which support MIDI sync, but I'm
&gt; just speculating at this point, I don't actually know enough about the
&gt; Windows port to know whether that would actually work or not.
