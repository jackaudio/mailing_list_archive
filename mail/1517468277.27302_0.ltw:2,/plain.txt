Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] ?= Usage feasibility

Hey Chris,
Thanks so much for your input.
I'm primarily on Windows, I think you have answered the question,
which would explain why I haven't heard or seen anyone with a setup using
Cubase and Ableton.

I've seen Bidule do some interesting routing but again not exactly what I
am looking for.

If you ever see this setup working please think of me, as it is my dream
setup.

Thanks again for your time much appreciated!

Cheers
Gaz
