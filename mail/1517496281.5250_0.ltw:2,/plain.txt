Just for additional information, I have an .so called jackmyplug.so, in /home/pi/jackmyplug.so (exporting jack_initialize/jack_finish), so I load it with:

pi@realtimepi:~ $ jack_load myplug /home/pi/jackmyplug.so
Jack: JackClient::SetupDriverSync driver sem in flush mode
Jack: JackLinuxFutex::Connect name = jack_sem.1000_default_jack_load
Jack: Clock source : system clock via clock_gettime
Jack: JackLibClient::Open name = jack_load refnum = 2
could not load /home/pi/jackmyplug.so, intclient = 0 status = 0x 1

Ideas ?
