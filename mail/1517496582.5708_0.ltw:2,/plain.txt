Ok, ok, slowly getting there, I've now copied the jackmyplug to /usr/local/lib/jack folder, and do:

pi@realtimepi:~ $ jack_load jackmyplug
Jack: JackClient::SetupDriverSync driver sem in flush mode
Jack: JackLinuxFutex::Connect name = jack_sem.1000_default_jack_load
Jack: Clock source : system clock via clock_gettime
Jack: JackLibClient::Open name = jack_load refnum = 2
Jack: JackClient::ClientNotify ref = 3 name = jackmyplug notify = 0
Jack: JackClient::AddClient name = jackmyplug, ref = 3
Jack: JackLinuxFutex::Connect name = jack_sem.1000_default_jackmyplug
Cannot read socket fd = 3 err = No such file or directory

Upon which the server stopped streaming. Does the above look ok ? None of my log outputs can been seen...
