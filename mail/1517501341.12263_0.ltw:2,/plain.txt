PLEASE.

I am still using Mac OS 10.9.5 because of Jack. If Jack can be updated to a newer OS, then I can finally upgrade.

I installed Jack with brew but I get these “could not handle external client request” errors which seems to be old problems from looking at search results and GitHub discussions - problems introduced when MacOS audio architecture was changed a while back. Is there any progress on these matters? Is someone working on it? I need Jack as it is a dependency to another library I would like to use but I realize that I might have to abandon MacOS as a platform in the process.
