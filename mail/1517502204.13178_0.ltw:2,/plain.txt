I think one of two things needs to happen:
1) the jack users who want Mac OS support to get cleaned up need to
recruit some Mac developers to help work on this

2) buy a new Mac for some of the current jack maintainers to use for
development and debug

As far as I know (and Filipe can correct this if I am mistaken), the
developers who originally worked on the Mac port of jackd have moved on to
other projects and are no longer actively involved in jack development (or
at least not much).  Previously Harrison had some interest in keeping the
Mac port usable, but now that Mixbus has the native audio backends from
Ardour, I don't think that there is any commercial entity supporting jack
on Windows or Mac, and the current maintainer is primarily a linux dev
working on jack as a volunteer, so users are going to have to step up and
find a way to keep this going.
