&gt; &gt; I am still using Mac OS 10.9.5 because of Jack. If Jack can be updated to

&gt; 
&gt; I think one of two things needs to happen:
&gt; 1) the jack users who want Mac OS support to get cleaned up need to
&gt; recruit some Mac developers to help work on this
&gt; 
&gt; 2) buy a new Mac for some of the current jack maintainers to use for
&gt; development and debug
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I know (and Filipe can correct this if I am mistaken), the
&gt; developers who originally worked on the Mac port of jackd have moved on to
&gt; other projects and are no longer actively involved in jack development (or
&gt; at least not much).  Previously Harrison had some interest in keeping the
&gt; Mac port usable, but now that Mixbus has the native audio backends from
&gt; Ardour, I don't think that there is any commercial entity supporting jack
&gt; on Windows or Mac, and the current maintainer is primarily a linux dev
&gt; working on jack as a volunteer, so users are going to have to step up and
&gt; find a way to keep this going.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Radium only has a Jack backend. If jack stops working on MacOS I will
&gt; certainly look into it, but I haven't noticed jack not working on any version
&gt; of MacOS (including high sierra), and I haven't heard any user compaining
&gt; about Jack not working on OSX before now.
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan, can you try to install Jack included with Radium instead of using brew?

The lastest JackOSX.0.92_b3.zip work indeed  up to high sierra, with the restriction that JackRouter device cannot be used as &#xAB; Audio default device &#xBB; anymore for CoreAudio application (known issue since Yosemite 10.10 I think)
