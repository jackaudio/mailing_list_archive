&gt; Can you explain a little more what you mean?  You can keep sample rate
&gt; sync using jack, if you also want to keep transport sync then you would
&gt; need jack aware applications that support the jack transport API.  Ardour
&gt; and Mixbus do, Qtractor, not sure if there are others.  May depend on if
&gt; you really mean DAW or if you mean a MIDI sequencer and a DAW, there are a
&gt; few sequencers which can be synchronized to jack.
&gt;
&gt;
Radium, Ardour, and BitWig (I think) are the three DAWs on Windows that
support Jack Transport, as far as I know.
And probably Mixbus.



&gt; Cubase and Ableton specifically in my case.
&gt;
&gt; Which OS platform are  you using?  Jack is multi-platform, but was
&gt; primarily developed and maintained on linux.  There are Windows and Mac OS
&gt; ports, but a lot fewer people are experienced in getting jack working on
&gt; those platforms.
&gt;
&gt;
I've been using jack on windows since around 2007. Haven't noticed any
problems.
MacOS should be fine too.
