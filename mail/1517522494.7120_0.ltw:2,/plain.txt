No need to get me a Mac, I already have a new MacBook from the company 
that I can use (temporarily) and a Mac-mini myself.
(I also have macOS in a VM for quick stuff)

In my view, JACK will always be focused on more open platforms first.

For macOS, new builds will be handled with waf instead of XCode.
But won't be a priority at first, there's some cleanup and handling of 
the code that I think needs to be done first,
which doesn't change the end result much so no new binaries really 
required for now.
