For years people could either install JACK1 from macport, or install everything (that is tools for users + all the stuff needed for developers...) using JackOSX. This was the recipe for all kind of hairy problems...

This « JackRouter as the default audio device »  broke at that time, for several technical reasons. One is that Apple decided to progressively raise their security model (sandbox model...whatever), and second was that the JackRouter driver model become obsolete. It would have to be entirely rewritten with the new recommended CoreAudio user-land driver model. I never had time to really estimate if the new model could 1) fit with JACK server/client model and all the needs in low-level OS primitives like sockets, shared memory, process synchronization.. 2) could really solve the « JackRouter use when selected as the audio default device » issue.

I have Jack router working in 10.9.5 as the default audio device. Yes, there were sandbox issues, but the small set of changes needed for the sandbox file was just that: small.

Add to the end of system.sb:

;;; local additions for Jack
  (allow network*
         (regex #"/private/tmp/jack_.*"))
  (allow file-write* 
         (regex #"/private/tmp/jack_.*"))
  (allow mach-lookup
         (global-name-regex "jack_mach_sem.*"))
  (allow ipc-sysv-sem)
  (allow ipc-posix-shm-read*
         (ipc-posix-name-regex "/jack-.*"))
  (allow ipc-posix-shm-write*
         (ipc-posix-name-regex "/jack-.*"))
  (allow file-read*
         (regex #"/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/JACK-insert.component.*"))

After this change JACK2 continued to work up to 10.13 High Sierra, but without this « JackRouter as the audio default device » . This last development is now in JackOSX 0.92_b3.

I was not aware that there was a new version of Jack that worked in 10.10. In any event, working as the default audio device is the key goal. Very few programs let me specify an output device.
