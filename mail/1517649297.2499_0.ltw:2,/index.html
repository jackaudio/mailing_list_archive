&gt; Radium only has a Jack backend. If jack stops working on MacOS I will
&gt; certainly look into it, but I haven't noticed jack not working on any
&gt; version
&gt; of MacOS (including high sierra), and I haven't heard any user compaining
&gt; about Jack not working on OSX before now.
&gt;
&gt; Stefan, can you try to install Jack included with Radium instead of using
&gt; brew?
&gt; http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/demos/macosx/?C=M;O=D
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I tried this version. It seems to be the same as on the jack&#x2026;org/download
&gt; page, right?
&gt;

Yes, it seems so. The download links on jackaudio.org have been more
conservative than the included version of Jack in Radium, so I always link
to Radium instead to make sure it's the latest version.



&gt; It seems to work as far as your use case is concerned (started your radium
&gt; and it seems to connect to that jack server). The ltc-tools (with jltcdump
&gt; as I mentioned in another mail in this thread). Does not seem to be
&gt; compatible with this version of jack though. I get the same &#x201C;failed to
&gt; connect errors&#x201D; as before.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; $ jltcdump
&gt; unknown option character l
&gt; connect(2) call to jackdmp 1.9.11/jack-502/default/jack_0 failed (err=No
&gt; such file or directory)
&gt;
&gt; So, it seems like Jack2 works in some ways (as in your use case) but
&gt; perhaps that the tools that link to its dynamic libraries are not always
&gt; fully compatible. Or that the programming interface between jack1 and jack2
&gt; has changed over time, I don&#x2019;t know.
&gt;
&gt;
I guess you have to recompile jltcdump. Seems like it's not been compiled
with an ABI-compatible version of jack.
