OSX comes with autotools since as far back as I can remember and it
still does (there's a subtle difference for libtoolize (BSD version vs
GNU version. Macs come with both: glibtoolize for the GNU version).

There are no plans to switch libltc to waf or any other build-system.
autotools sucks least by far when it comes to libraries, cross-compiling
libs, architecture support and exporting symbols.
