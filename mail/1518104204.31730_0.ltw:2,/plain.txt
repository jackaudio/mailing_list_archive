Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Midi out no longer showing up in patch bay

Hello! OK, previously I had Akai MPC 2.0 Jacked to Harrison Mixbus and it
worked perfectly. I had to format my HDD & reinstall Windows , and I set
everything up exactly the same, yet Jack cannot see the MPC's midi out now.
I use W10 Pro x64, 8gb ram. Audio connections are working perfectly. Mixbus
can see the MPC's midi out, but Jack cannot. MPC midi out is handled by a
separate application called midimon.exe and is normally seen as
"AkaiProInternalMidi." In both the connections section and the patchbay,
it's as if it doesn't exist. I tried installing it as admin, and running it
as admin too, no change. Is there a way to force Jack to see it? MPC has a
crippled mixer, Jacking it to Mixbus is a crucial part of my workflow.
Please help! Thank you.
