Likely  you changed slightly the order you put the command line arguments
into the shortcut compared to your old installation.
It is a little more obvious if you look through the documentation a few
times, but essentially the way that jackd starts up involves parsing the
command line arguments into arguments for jackd, and sub-arguments that
modify the top level arguments.
So for example -X winmme means use the Windows MME driver for MIDI, -d
portaudio means use the portaudio library as the driver interface, but
arguments after "-d portaudio" usually mean more specific driver settings,
so this:
jackd -X winmme -d portaudio
means use winmme MIDI driver, use portaudio for the audio driver interface
but this:
jackd -d portaudio -X winmme
could be interpreted as use portaudio for the audio driver interface, pass
"-X winmme" to the portaudio driver as additional settings.

If you had started jackd from a command shell and looked at the messages
printed it would likely have printed something like "no -X parameter
recognized, portaudio driver ignoring" or something along those lines.
It isn't a very intuitive way to do things on Windows, but on linux and OS
X where jack was originally developed after the -d portion is where you
would put the specific settings for the audio driver, like whether it
should use 44100 or 48000 as the sample rate, how many channels to use if
you hardware supports more than two channels, etc.
