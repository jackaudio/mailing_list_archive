&gt; second was that the JackRouter driver model become obsolete. It would

&gt; low-level OS primitives like sockets, shared memory, process
&gt; synchronization.. 2) could really solve the &#xAB; JackRouter use when
&gt; selected as the audio default device &#xBB; issue.

&gt; - I had to solve a specific issue in 10.10 (I think ?) when mach
&gt; semaphore primitive could not be used anymore, and we have to switch to
&gt; Posix Semaphore. After this change JACK2 continued to work up to 10.13
&gt; High Sierra, but without this &#xAB;  JackRouter as the audio default device &#xBB;
&gt; . This last development is now in JackOSX 0.92_b3.

Hi St&#xE9;phane,
JackOSX 0.92_b3 works nicely on Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.
I'd like to try to compile that same package.
I found
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jackosx/files/JackOSX/ it lists files up to
v 0.89 (2011-12-17).
Where could i find the latest source code for JackPilot and JackRouter /
JackOSX 0.92_b3?
Best regards
Thomas
