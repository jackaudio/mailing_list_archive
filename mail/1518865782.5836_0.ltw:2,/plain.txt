Hi Stéphane,
JackOSX 0.92_b3 works nicely on Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.
I'd like to try to compile that same package.
I found
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jackosx/files/JackOSX/ it lists files up to
v 0.89 (2011-12-17).
Where could i find the latest source code for JackPilot and JackRouter /
JackOSX 0.92_b3?
Best regards
Thomas
