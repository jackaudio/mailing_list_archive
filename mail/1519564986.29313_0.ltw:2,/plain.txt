Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Handling adaptive number of input samples required for adaptive resampler

As the Jack callback is absolute, and that won't change, you'll have to adapt to it. Keep tab on clocks to have a resampling factor which is used to resample what you have to what you need. This is by no means an easy task, CoreAudio on Mac works like this to sync separate audio cards into an aggregate device.

Hi,

I have a requirement to do a re-sampling based on drift detected on jitter buffer.
Suppose I have set jack process callback to 128 samples, and I detected that I have to do
an resampling by 10%, ie n_in = 1.1 * nout then I need 12.8 samples more, which is not available and
has to wait for next callback. This will delay my processing. If I make my buffer size
more than 128, I may have to do a decimation based on drift in which direction.

How to handle these cases of having   varying buffer size requirements ?
