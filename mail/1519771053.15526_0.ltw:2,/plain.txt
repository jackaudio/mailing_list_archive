Well, tell Pulseaudio to stop hogging the device.  One way is to call
pavucontrol and turn that device's Pulseaudio profile to "Off".  Another
is to configure Pulseaudio to not restart in the first place (create a
.pulse/client.conf file containing

autospawn = no

.  You will then need to start pulseaudio manually using

pulseaudio -D

every time you want to use it.  One audio daemon less competing for
realtime resources is probably not the worst idea, but I don't really
know how much of a problem a dormant Pulseaudio can be.
