Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] The playback device hw:0 is already in use

Thanks David,

I tried as you suggest, but then I loose the volume control in the 
system tray and the volume functions keys don't work, so I loose all 
control of the volume - so it is not an option.

It all seems very intermittent, sometime I get the device in use, other 
times I get no such device (as below) and others it works.

creating alsa driver ... hw:0|hw:0|256|2|8000|0|0|nomon|swmeter|-|32bit
control open "hw:0" (No such file or directory)
ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1713:(_snd_pcm_hw_open) Invalid value for card
ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1713:(_snd_pcm_hw_open) Invalid value for card
ALSA: Cannot open PCM device alsa_pcm for playback. Falling back to 
capture-only mode
Cannot initialize driver
JackServer::Open failed with -1

My workaround for now is to start  jackd manually and repeat until it 
works. Occasionally it works 1st time, usually 2nd and occasionally it 
takes 3 times. It also fits in with my requirement of needing to use it 
at 8kHz.

If jack becomes a permanent feature then I will have to revisit this but 
for now its satisfactory.

My manual startup script is as below (the non jackd commands are just to 
try and get a clue to the problem)

fuser -v /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p
nohup jackd -d alsa -r 8000 -p 256 &> /tmp/jackd.log &
sleep 2
fuser -v /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p
ps aux |grep jackd | grep -v grep

I am struggling as I have yet to locate any documentation - Can anyone 
give me a link?

Thanks for your help

Tim
