&gt; Hi list,

&gt; (Sorry this question has already been discussed but the search function in the archive of the list does not work)
&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone working on the problem of getting Jack up and running on MacOS again? I installed Jack with brew but I get these &#x201C;could not handle external client request&#x201D; errors which seems to be old problems from looking at search results and GitHub discussions - problems introduced when MacOS audio architecture was changed a while back. Is there any progress on these matters? Is someone working on it? I need Jack as it is a dependency to another library I would like to use but I realize that I might have to abandon MacOS as a platform in the process.

I looked at this a year or so ago, but ended up concluding that it was 
too much work (for someone who had little to gain from it other than 
just interest). I concluded in the case of JackOSX it would require an 
almost full rewrite of the Router for modern macOS APIs. I could 
probably look into it again, if someone could convince me :)
