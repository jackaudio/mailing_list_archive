In-Reply-To: Christopher Obbard [Jack-Devel] Fwd: connecting to JACKD2 with low buffer sizes (1521973955.21072_0.ltw:2,)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Fwd: connecting to JACKD2 with low buffer sizes

Hi Chris,

Not sure how much this helps, but I have been running the audioinjector octocard (6 in/8 out) on a RPi 3, with stable streaming down to 8 frames per buffer, with a distribution called RealtimePi (https://github.com/guysoft/RealtimePi) Unfortunately I don't know the specific kernel details of it.

My exact setup can be found here: http://forum.audioinjector.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2727&start=30#p5749

Problem of course is that the lower the buffer size, the higher the CPU utilization. With 64 frames per buffer, the latency/CPU tradeoff is acceptable (I think with 8 frame per buffer, I had nearly 100% CPU just shoveling audio from input to output, with 64 it's ~10%).

Regards
/Robert
