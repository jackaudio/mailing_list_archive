Hi Chris,

Yeah, BeagleBone Black. It's quite a nice board!

Ah, I've been running mainline stable 4.14, applied CONFIG_PREEMPT and
ran a cyclictest on three threads with no extra load. It was giving me
"ok" average latency, and terrible maximum latency. It happened to be
every few seconds there would be a massive spike. No wonder I've been
stumped !!!

using 4.14-rt branch from https://github.com/beagleboard/linux/, the
same cyclictest without load was giving me a maximum of 46. So this is
looking promising!

Started jackd, all looking OK.
Can get jack periods down to 64 now, even 32! But some dreaded errors occur.
This time I have a printk message of "GBLCTL write error" every few us.
Good news! Looks like a bug in the mcasp driver.
Message didn't appear on Mainline, it's getting late here so time to
squish tomorrow.
I tried my client with the jackd -adummy, I know it's not a real test
but it managed to run down to 32 frames.

Lesson learnt: use vendor BSP (unless vendor is Chinese. That has
bitten me before ;-) )

Thanks for your detailed explanation! It really helps for me, been
diving deep into the kernel for the past year or so.
Been software/electronic engineer at a higher level for a few years,
but this is just super interesting to me.

Yeah, the system is all setup for Audio to have realtime. I've managed
to set similar stuff up on a number of different AMD64 systems before,
but not so much on ARM embedded boards.

Yeah, the rtirq script is handy. It will need some tweaking for arm
boards, I think.

This is somewhere I want to improve docs after figuring it out a bit better :-).

Thanks, that kind of matches what I was thinking.

the TI defconfig for RT sets 250Hz, and it seems to do OK.

Exactly that, nothing super clever :-).

This is the kind of experienced knowledge that is really helpful to me!

That makes sense!

Hopefully, the bug I have uncovered with the GBLCTL was making me
loose the plot a little bit :-)


Really appreciate your in-depth replies.


Cheers!
