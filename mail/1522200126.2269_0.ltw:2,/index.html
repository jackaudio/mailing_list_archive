&gt;&gt; Hi list,

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is anyone working on the problem of getting Jack up and running on MacOS
&gt;&gt; again? I installed Jack with brew but I get these &#x201C;could not handle
&gt;&gt; external client request&#x201D; errors which seems to be old problems from
&gt;&gt; looking at search results and GitHub discussions - problems introduced
&gt;&gt; when MacOS audio architecture was changed a while back. Is there any
&gt;&gt; progress on these matters? Is someone working on it? I need Jack as it
&gt;&gt; is a dependency to another library I would like to use but I realize
&gt;&gt; that I might have to abandon MacOS as a platform in the process.
&gt;
&gt; I looked at this a year or so ago, but ended up concluding that it was
&gt; too much work (for someone who had little to gain from it other than
&gt; just interest). I concluded in the case of JackOSX it would require an
&gt; almost full rewrite of the Router for modern macOS APIs. I could
&gt; probably look into it again, if someone could convince me :)


For the original poster, do not use brew, go get the latest package for
MacOS from jackaudio.org.
That will install jackd and several other tools that are needed.

This came up a few months back. The original developer stated that because
of sandbox/security changed in MacOS the jack router application could no
longer be the default audio device, so software which lets you select the
audio device may continue to work, but software which only uses the system
default device may not be able to use jackd through jack router.

A list user named "Michael" then posted this reply:

I have Jack router working in 10.9.5 as the default audio device. Yes, there
were sandbox issues, but the small set of changes needed for the sandbox file
was just that: small.

Add to the end of system.sb:

;;; local additions for Jack
  (allow network*
         (regex #"/private/tmp/jack_.*"))
  (allow file-write*
         (regex #"/private/tmp/jack_.*"))
  (allow mach-lookup
         (global-name-regex "jack_mach_sem.*"))
  (allow ipc-sysv-sem)
  (allow ipc-posix-shm-read*
         (ipc-posix-name-regex "/jack-.*"))
  (allow ipc-posix-shm-write*
         (ipc-posix-name-regex "/jack-.*"))
  (allow file-read*
         (regex
#"/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/JACK-insert.component.*"))


Perhaps that can help.
