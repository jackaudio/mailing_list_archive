For the original poster, do not use brew, go get the latest package for
MacOS from jackaudio.org.
That will install jackd and several other tools that are needed.

This came up a few months back. The original developer stated that because
of sandbox/security changed in MacOS the jack router application could no
longer be the default audio device, so software which lets you select the
audio device may continue to work, but software which only uses the system
default device may not be able to use jackd through jack router.

A list user named "Michael" then posted this reply:

I have Jack router working in 10.9.5 as the default audio device. Yes, there
were sandbox issues, but the small set of changes needed for the sandbox file
was just that: small.

Add to the end of system.sb:

;;; local additions for Jack
  (allow network*
         (regex #"/private/tmp/jack_.*"))
  (allow file-write*
         (regex #"/private/tmp/jack_.*"))
  (allow mach-lookup
         (global-name-regex "jack_mach_sem.*"))
  (allow ipc-sysv-sem)
  (allow ipc-posix-shm-read*
         (ipc-posix-name-regex "/jack-.*"))
  (allow ipc-posix-shm-write*
         (ipc-posix-name-regex "/jack-.*"))
  (allow file-read*
         (regex
#"/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/JACK-insert.component.*"))


Perhaps that can help.
