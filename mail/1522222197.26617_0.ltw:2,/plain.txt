Hi Stefan,

> You just cannot change jack to be the default audio device as you once could so you cannot route audio from apps (like iTunes) like you could before. This was not a strong requirement in my case though - useful for testing, but only that.

I guess that's Apple being clever and trying to tell you you can't
route iTunes thru to a recording program and save DRM-free music ;-)
Have done similar with the Spotify API and JACK in the past, now
where's that script gone...
