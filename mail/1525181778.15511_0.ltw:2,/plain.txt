We shouldn't create a problem that doesn't exist. If there are problems with
the windows or osx versions of Jack, they will be fixed. I will at least
try to
fix them since Radium uses jack and I don't see any reason to ditch jack.
The main reason there
hasn't been a new release for a while is because there hasn't been any
reason
to create a new release. They work just fine.
