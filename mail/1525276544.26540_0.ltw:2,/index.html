&gt;&gt; If we don't care, then should we start
&gt;&gt; marking those ports as only partially supported so users do not have
&gt;&gt; expectations that cannot be met?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; We shouldn't create a problem that doesn't exist. If there are problems
&gt; with the windows or osx versions of Jack, they will be fixed. I will at
&gt; least try to fix them since Radium uses jack and I don't see any reason to
&gt; ditch jack. The main reason there
&gt; hasn't been a new release for a while is because there hasn't been any
&gt; reason to create a new release. They work just fine.

Thanks for this. That's what I was wondering. It does work fine in
32bit/x86 (see below) as I've found out. Below 5ms latency and now with 16
channels after I followed advice in other replies. Thanks people.

Docs mention contacting list if 64bit support required. I installed dual
32/64 version. Fine in 32, however with 64bit Mixxx it can't see the Jack
ASIO driver and with Reaper it can see it but the driver always crashes
and Reaper gives a message (have not got it in front of me just now).
