Thanks for this. That's what I was wondering. It does work fine in
32bit/x86 (see below) as I've found out. Below 5ms latency and now with 16
channels after I followed advice in other replies. Thanks people.

Docs mention contacting list if 64bit support required. I installed dual
32/64 version. Fine in 32, however with 64bit Mixxx it can't see the Jack
ASIO driver and with Reaper it can see it but the driver always crashes
and Reaper gives a message (have not got it in front of me just now).
