 For JACK in Windows 64-bit you have an extra manual installation step
  

  
See   http://jackaudio.org/faq/jack_on_windows.html   
  
From ...The Jack v 1.9.8/64bits/JackRouter.dll still has to be registered &#x201C;manually&#x201D; with regsvr32
  
  
  
 Have you done that?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  If we don't care, then should we start  
&gt; &gt;&gt;  marking those ports as only partially supported so users do not have  
&gt; &gt;&gt;  expectations that cannot be met?  
&gt; &gt;&gt;   
&gt; &gt;&gt;   
&gt; &gt;  We shouldn't create a problem that doesn't exist. If there are problems  
&gt; &gt;  with the windows or osx versions of Jack, they will be fixed. I will at  
&gt; &gt;  least try to fix them since Radium uses jack and I don't see any reason to  
&gt; &gt;  ditch jack. The main reason there  
&gt; &gt;  hasn't been a new release for a while is because there hasn't been any  
&gt; &gt;  reason to create a new release. They work just fine.  
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for this. That's what I was wondering. It does work fine in  
&gt; 32bit/x86 (see below) as I've found out. Below 5ms latency and now with 16  
&gt; channels after I followed advice in other replies. Thanks people.  
&gt;
&gt; Docs mention contacting list if 64bit support required. I installed dual  
&gt; 32/64 version. Fine in 32, however with 64bit Mixxx it can't see the Jack  
&gt; ASIO driver and with Reaper it can see it but the driver always crashes  
&gt; and Reaper gives a message (have not got it in front of me just now).
