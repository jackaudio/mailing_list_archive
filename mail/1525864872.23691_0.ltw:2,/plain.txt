In-Reply-To: Christophe Lohr [Jack-Devel] How to use jackd as a 'system-wide' server? (1525857409.12663_0.ltw:2,)

Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] How to use jackd as a 'system-wide' server?

I think you'd need to run the jackd server in promiscuous mode.  IIRC
that is broken on jack2, but worked last time I tried it with jack1.

Here is a unit file I wrote a long time ago to run it on archlinux:

cat /etc/systemd/system/jackd.service 
[Unit]
Description=Start the JACK server in promiscuous mode

[Service]
Type=simple
Environment="JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER="
UMask=0
ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackd -P80 -p512 -t5000 -dalsa -dhw:DSP -r44100 -p128 -n2 -i18 -o18 -I47 -O48

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Note that you'll have to set the JACK_PROMISCUOUS_SERVER environment
variable in your user login shell too for the client libs to find the
server.
