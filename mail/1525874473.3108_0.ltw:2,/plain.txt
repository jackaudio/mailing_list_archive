What user account is used for the asterisk server?  Probably jackd should
be started under the same user.

You may need to compile jackd yourself, I think many distributions which
ship jack2 enable dbus support in the build shipped by the distribution. 
There was a thread on the mailing list in the past where someone posted a
way to "fake" some of the dbus information required to get jackd with dbus
support running without a graphical session started, you could search for
that, but probably just compiling without dbus support enabled would be
more straight forward.
