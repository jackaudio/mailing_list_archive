Perhaps I missed it, but I don't recall seeing any information about the
arguments given to jackd.  Can you post the parameters used?

Are you running an RT kernel? Is it possible that the period size is just
too small and asterisk can't keep up?

I see that app_jack includes a resampler, what sample rate is asterisk
using, and what sample rate is jackd using?

The error message is here, but it is not obvious yet what controls the
length written:

	res = jack_ringbuffer_write(jack_data->output_rb, (const char *) f_buf,
f_buf_used * sizeof(float));
	if (res != (f_buf_used * sizeof(float))) {
		ast_log(LOG_WARNING, "Tried to write %d bytes to the ringbuffer, but
only wrote %d\n",
			(int) (f_buf_used * sizeof(float)), (int) res);
}


I don't see jack_ringbuffer_write() in that same app_jack.c file and I
don't really have time to search through the other files right now.
Have you asked on the asterisk developer list?  They may have a better
idea of what often causes problems for asterisk.
