Not writing the full amount of data won't be a solution, it just hides the
warning.

Writing it later seems to be no solution since the data is "gone" once the
function returns.

The ringbuffer actually solves this by providing that storage between
functions/threads. It just has to be big enough and read out at a rate
that will allow for more input data in time.
