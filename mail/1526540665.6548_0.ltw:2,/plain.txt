Well, in fact Asterisk does not expect a specific sample rate. This
depends of the codecs that have been negotiated with the peer for the
ongoing call...
By default, the sip trunk uses  ilbc g729 gsm g723 ulaw codecs. The
sampling rate can be 8kHz, 16kHz, or 13.3...
Maybe I can tell jack to use 16kHz sampling rate, and let it convert
when needed.

The use-case is about voice calls. Humans are rather tolerant about the
latency of a phone call. isn't it?

The app is the speech-to-text Pocketsphinx (the code is slightly
modified for my needs)
Pocketsphinx uses pulseaudio as audio interface. So I need its jack
source/sink plugin.

So, there is no physical audio device in my system: the audio of the
caller is to be passed to the STT recognition system via the audio server.
