Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [ANN] The QStuff* Pre-LAC2018 Release Frenzy Hotfix!

Avast ye lads!

The Qstuff* Pre-LAC2018 [7] release frenzy continues... now with a hotfix!


** QjackCtl - JACK Audio Connection Kit Qt GUI Interface [1] **

  QjackCtl 0.5.1 (pre-lac2018 hotfix) is out!

QjackCtl is a(n ageing but still) simple Qt [2] application to control
the JACK [3] sound server, for the Linux Audio infrastructure.

Change-log:
- Respect ALSA [4] Sequencer support option also on Graph view.
- Regression to new Graph node/ports sorting comparator; also fixed
multiple and many port removals, most probably causing it to crash due
to double-free/delete potential.
- Fixed the automatic aggregation of new Graph client nodes that are
split as either input or output only (ie. system, terminal, physical or
otherwise non-duplex nodes).
- Added View/Zoom Range mode option to Graph tool.
