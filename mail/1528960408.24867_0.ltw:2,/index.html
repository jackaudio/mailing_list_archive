I don't know. Maybe just try to narrow down what's wrong:

1. Check if the problem lies in Cakewalk:
Can you receive sound from other inputs in Cakewalk? From an internal
soundcard for instance.

2. Check if the problem lies in JackRouter:
Try to record from a different ASIO program than Cakewalk.

3. Check if the program lies in Akai MPC:
Try to send sound to JackRouter from a different source than Akai MPC.
(try radium: http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/download.php . Radium
is also good to check if Jack works properly)

&gt;
&gt; I open Cakewalk, nothing. Then I open a cakewalk project set up to accept
&gt; audio from Jack. (It shows Jack router in Cakewalk settings as being the
&gt; only active audio device. I assure you this part of the routing is good, it
&gt; worked until a couple of days ago). Anyway when I open said project
&gt; template, the cmd window says:
&gt;
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 42 port_dst = 9
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 43 port_dst = 10
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 44 port_dst = 11
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 45 port_dst = 12
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 46 port_dst = 13
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 42 port_dst = 9
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 43 port_dst = 10
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 44 port_dst = 11
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 45 port_dst = 12
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 46 port_dst = 13
&gt;
&gt; Then I open the Akai MPC software (the plugin of which suuuucks, thus the
&gt; need for Jack). The cmd window says this:
&gt;
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 5 port_dst = 16
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 6 port_dst = 17
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 7 port_dst = 18
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 8 port_dst = 19
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 48 port_dst = 9
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 49 port_dst = 10
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 50 port_dst = 11
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 51 port_dst = 12
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 52 port_dst = 13
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 5 port_dst = 80
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 6 port_dst = 81
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 7 port_dst = 82
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 8 port_dst = 83
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 112 port_dst = 9
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 113 port_dst = 10
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 114 port_dst = 11
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 115 port_dst = 12
&gt; JackGraphManager::Connect different port types port_src = 116 port_dst = 13
&gt;
&gt; All tracks in MPC are routed to their appropriate output. Confusingly, Only
&gt; the first track sounds. Cakewalk doesn't hear it or any other output.
&gt; Output
&gt; seems to be going straight to my computer's audio out, but only from 1,2.
&gt;
&gt; It makes no sense to me that it was working just a couple days ago the
&gt; suddenly stopped. I appreciate any help anyone might give me. Thank you.
