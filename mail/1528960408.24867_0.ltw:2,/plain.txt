Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Suddenly, Cakewalk won't connect to Jack

I don't know. Maybe just try to narrow down what's wrong:

1. Check if the problem lies in Cakewalk:
Can you receive sound from other inputs in Cakewalk? From an internal
soundcard for instance.

2. Check if the problem lies in JackRouter:
Try to record from a different ASIO program than Cakewalk.

3. Check if the program lies in Akai MPC:
Try to send sound to JackRouter from a different source than Akai MPC.
(try radium: http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/download.php . Radium
is also good to check if Jack works properly)
