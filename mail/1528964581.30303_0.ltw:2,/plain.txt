HTH,

If it just stopped working then either it is human error or system
error. To assume former is wrong so the problem probably lies in self
updating proprietary (operating) system you use.

From the messages in your other email, it seems like different system
processes use different binary builds of jack dll.

If you cannot repair it, you don't own it :)
