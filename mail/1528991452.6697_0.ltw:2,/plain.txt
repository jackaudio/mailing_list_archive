Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Suddenly, Cakewalk won't connect to Jack

I was beginning to think the same thing, maybe a windows update killed it. I
even formatted my drive and did a clean w10 install, ran all the updates,
and the problem persists.

As for Tue other post, great ideas. So far:

MPC sends audio to Harrison Mixbus fine, but it has a couple of extra
connections on 1,2 that need to be disabled each time they open or else 1&2
are REALLY LOUD.

I also tried to connect using the Jack Control thingy, and here are some
more clues: 1,2 are occupied by something. I have no idea what, but I can
get all the rest of the connections to work via either "Connections" or
"Patch bay." 1&2 won't connect for s***t no matter what I do. 

Asio4all says that they're occupied by that MS Wavetable Synth that always
shows up in my midi devices. I did a web search, but no one seems to know
how to disable it. I normally use FL ASIO, it's way more stable than
ASIO4ALL but I was desperate. 

I have disabled "exclusive" in Control Panel/Sounds. 

Thanks for the responses. I'll try some more stuff today.
