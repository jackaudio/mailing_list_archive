Hi, I'd like to report that out of curiosity, I just built
  and installed jack2-1.9.12, here on openSUSE Tumbleweed,
  with the profiling enabled with --profile configure flag.

Here's what I get:

====================================
/usr/local/bin/jackd -P30 -dalsa -r44100 -p256 -n2 -Xseq -D 
-Chw:M1010LT,0 '-Phw:M1010LT,0'

====================================

Note you must stop the server before the profiling info can be
  gathered and written, as shown in that .pdf link someone posted.
I'm not sure if it could not write because I ungracefully
  killed it, or it's simply a permissions/location thing,
  probably the latter, I have not looked into it any further
  yet...
