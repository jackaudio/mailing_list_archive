I guess this is an example of how Linux audio software has
become a victim of its own success.

I've been using jackd for audio work since 2005. Up until
recently the level of discussion on most of the Linux audio
mailing lists was quite high. Over the last three or four
years I've gradually unsubscribed from most of them as
they've become unusable due to adolescent behaviour like
the above.

I was hoping jack-devel wouldn't succumb like the others.
Pity.
