&gt; 
&gt; Many months back falkTX took on maintenance for both jackd v1 and
&gt; jackd v2 code, so jack2 is maintained to the same extent as jack1.
&gt; FalkTX previously posted plans for 2018, primarily clean up tasks
&gt; like getting shared headers (i.e. shared between jack 1 and jack 2)
&gt; fully working, porting the zita-ajbridge based clients from jack v1
&gt; to jack v2, I think also porting in a2jmidid internal client to jack
&gt; v2.  I have no idea how much progress has been made on those; I'm
&gt; sure clean patches would probably be accepted.

That's why I wrote "isn't really maintained"..  I am aware that falktx
has taken on the maintainership, and hopefully the future will bring
improvements.

The point was that JACK2 even though it had a maintainer
before falktx was somewhat bit rotting and not getting any real
development, while JACK1 got updates as long as Paul was maintaining
it.

Just thought it was a possibility that profiling was also something not
working properly anymore. 

I suppose I should have chosen other words to avoid misunderstanding :)
