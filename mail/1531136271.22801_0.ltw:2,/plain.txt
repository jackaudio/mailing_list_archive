That's why I wrote "isn't really maintained"..  I am aware that falktx
has taken on the maintainership, and hopefully the future will bring
improvements.

The point was that JACK2 even though it had a maintainer
before falktx was somewhat bit rotting and not getting any real
development, while JACK1 got updates as long as Paul was maintaining
it.

Just thought it was a possibility that profiling was also something not
working properly anymore. 

I suppose I should have chosen other words to avoid misunderstanding :)
