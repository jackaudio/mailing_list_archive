&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Many months back falkTX took on maintenance for both jackd v1 and
&gt; &gt; jackd v2 code, so jack2 is maintained to the same extent as jack1.
&gt; &gt; FalkTX previously posted plans for 2018, primarily clean up tasks
&gt; &gt; like getting shared headers (i.e. shared between jack 1 and jack 2)
&gt; &gt; fully working, porting the zita-ajbridge based clients from jack v1
&gt; &gt; to jack v2, I think also porting in a2jmidid internal client to jack
&gt; &gt; v2.  I have no idea how much progress has been made on those; I'm
&gt; &gt; sure clean patches would probably be accepted.
&gt;
&gt; That's why I wrote "isn't really maintained"..  I am aware that falktx
&gt; has taken on the maintainership, and hopefully the future will bring
&gt; improvements.
&gt;
&gt; The point was that JACK2 even though it had a maintainer
&gt; before falktx was somewhat bit rotting and not getting any real
&gt; development, while JACK1 got updates as long as Paul was maintaining
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; Just thought it was a possibility that profiling was also something not
&gt; working properly anymore.
&gt;
&gt; I suppose I should have chosen other words to avoid misunderstanding :)
&gt;
&gt;
This seems like FUD. If something isn't working, report it. Few updates
doesn't
mean that it's "bit rotting" or "isn't really maintained". If something
works
as it should, it doesn't need updates.
