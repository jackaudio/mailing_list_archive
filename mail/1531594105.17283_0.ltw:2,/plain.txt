Paul always warned strongly against that.  How do you make sure the one in
usr is not used?
The recommendation I had always heard when using something like Fedora
which would try to remove a lot of packages if you removed the system
provided RPM was to just delete the files manually, without touching the
RPM database, then install the locally built version.
Maybe you found a method that works reliably, but in the past at least
even the jackd developers wouldn't trust leaving the distribution provided
files on the filesystem.
