The PATH environment variable only controls where you search for
executables, not shared libraries.
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/22926/where-do-executables-look-for-shared-objects-at-runtime
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/171632/where-will-the-system-search-for-dynamic-libraries
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html

Notice in the ld man page that executables can have a search path in the
ELF header.  The executables DT_RUNPATH value comes before the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in the search order.

Seems like there are several ways that loading the newly compiled version
could go wrong if the older files are still present.
