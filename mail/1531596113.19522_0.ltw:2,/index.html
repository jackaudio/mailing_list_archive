&gt; Paul always warned strongly against that.  How do you make sure the one in
&gt; usr is not used?

It should be automatic.
All user-built software is usually installed in /usr/local.
Most systems automatically look in /usr/local/bin FIRST
  before /usr/bin when you type an un-pathed program name

This makes it very easy to run your own builds of software while
  NOT disturbing the packaging system's installed versions in any way.

I routinely run my built versions of jack-1 or jack-2 installed in
  /usr/local, all while my distro's jack-2 package installation sits
  undisturbed in /usr. When I want to go back to the packaged version,
  I simply uninstall my built version, that MUST be done, to go back.

This is how I helped debug jack-1 and jack-2 at the same time.

Cheers.
Tim.

&gt; The recommendation I had always heard when using something like Fedora
&gt; which would try to remove a lot of packages if you removed the system
&gt; provided RPM was to just delete the files manually, without touching the
&gt; RPM database, then install the locally built version.
&gt; Maybe you found a method that works reliably, but in the past at least
&gt; even the jackd developers wouldn't trust leaving the distribution provided
&gt; files on the filesystem.
