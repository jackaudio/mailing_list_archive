Not that I think this is a good idea - but for completeness it is possible
to just compile JACK 1 or 2 locally (aka, no install to /usr/ or /usr/local)
and then us LD_PRELOAD to have the linker load the required .so's before
starting JACK.

This ain't pretty, but if there's no JACK .so's in LD_LIBRARY_PATH at all,
and you *must* manually specify them all the time, at least its human error
if things go wrong.

Re-hash; this is a "solution" that I don't really recommend in this case,
however LD_PRELOAD can be quiet useful in other situations (like the
magic of JACK Interposer : https://github.com/raboof/jack_interposer : )
hence my promoting it here.
