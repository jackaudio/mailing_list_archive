It does not work in my OS (Fedora), After installing jack to /usr/local and
ldconfig, the old jack (rpm-based) is launched. I have  /usr/local/bin in my
PATH before /user/bin. Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to a directory with jack
libraries also does not have any effect.

The only workable solution I found is building my own rpm and updating the
system installed jack
