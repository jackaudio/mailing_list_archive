I've been using that method as well, it works pretty good. Overwriting the
distro package's files also circumvents a lot of package dependency
issues. You could have jack installed from source and the repo jack
package will most likely be pulled in sooner or later as a dependency by
another package anyways.

In a perfect world, there should be no reason that a preferred parallel
installation in /usr/local would not work *for every client* that does not
dlopen from a fixed location or otherwise tamper with the linker
($LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc). It has the advantage of not caring to re-install
the compiled version after updates. Using 'ldd' on binaries to check which
libraries are going to be used is an easy way to predict what will happen.

In any case, checking which libraries are effectively somewhere on the
system is always good advice. 'sudo updatedb && locate libjack' followed
by selective removes and re-installs.
