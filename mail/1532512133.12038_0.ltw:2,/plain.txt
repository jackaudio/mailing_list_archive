Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack crushes after 60 min running without problems

 Hey Folks,

I have a problem with Jack running on my Rapi 3:
I start the server like This:

And after running an Hour, out of nothing, I got this error:

I tried several times with different configs, bus it always crushes like
this. With 4 Periods after around 30min, with this 6 periods after an hour.

Does anyone has an idea what the reason for this behavior could be?
Thanks in advance!

Moritz
