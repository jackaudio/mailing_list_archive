&gt; I have a problem with Jack running on my Rapi 3:

Do you mean a Rasberry Pi 3 device?
That is the processor, but what is the audio device? I wasn't aware
Rasberry Pi had built in audio, is that new for the 3 device, or did 
earlier devices have that as well?
Show the output of aplay -l to see how the device is detected.

This looks unusual:
&gt; Jack: capture device hw:1
&gt; Jack: playback device hw:0

Different devices for capture and playback is strange.
How did you even specify that?  What is the startup command line you use
for jackd?

&gt; configuring for 32000Hz, period = 128 frames (4.0 ms), buffer = 6 periods

128 frames and 6 periods is an unusual configuration, have you tried 256
frames and 3 periods?

&gt; JackEngine::XRun: client = MHA was not finished, state = Running

What client is this (MHA)?  This error message means that the client MHA
did not  finish processing the audio in the amount of time allocated.

&gt; Does anyone has an idea what the reason for this behavior could be?

Seems like the application you are using cannot maintain the audio
processing.
Try larger period size like 256 or 512 or even 1024 if you are not running
something which is very latency sensitive.  Are you using this for real
time music production (guitar effects, soft synthesizer application), or
just audio playback?   If just for audio playback you should be able to 
use 1024 without any problem.  For something like a guitar effects
processor you would probably want lower latency, but even then 256 may be
OK.
