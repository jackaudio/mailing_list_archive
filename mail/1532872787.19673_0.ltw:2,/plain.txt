Thanks a lot for those links, that's very helpful!

So jack_midi_get_event_count() really just returns the (private)
"event_count" field of the buffer structure.

My follow-up question now is:

Is the "event_count" field ever changed by JACK while a process
callback is running?

It seems unlikely to me, but it looks this is exactly what is
happening in the case of the bug report I've received.

Is it possible that the buffer is cleared while a process callback is
still running?

Of course it would also be possible (but similarly unlikely) that some
of the user code is writing to the buffer structure.

If I didn't miss anything, jack_midi_event_get() can never write to
the "event_count" field.

OK.

OK, good to know.

Yes, I've used that same link a few lines above.
It tells us about the return value:

    0 on success, ENODATA if buffer is empty.

Having looked at the implementations in the meantime, I now know that
JACK1 returns ENODATA and JACK2 returns -ENOBUFS.

So this is clearly a mismatch between the documentation and the JACK2
implementation.

This also shows that the user who filed the bug report was using
JACK2, since they got a return value of -105 (which is -ENOBUFS).

cheers,
Matthias
