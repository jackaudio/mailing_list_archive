Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Jack on Win7 with DirectSound devices?

Hi,

Perhaps a newbie question, but the available information is somewhat 
contradictory.Â  I'm under the impression that the Jack server on Windows 
only works with ASIO devices, along the lines of:

jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::<device name here>"

Is it possible to instead use a DirectSound device? Documentation 
indicates that it should be, but on my machine any variation like this 
fails:

jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "DirectSound::<device name here>"

Am I missing something, or is it in fact not currently possible to to 
connect to a directsound device?

-Rick
