This may sound defaitist but I'd lean towards just using an analog EQ
here.

Wait, I am missing something here.  "since I use this output only for
mixing/mastering".  How does your first audio adapter even come into
play here?

Interpolation will be needed when the clocks drift.  Basically you need
to delay by fractional sample amounts and the kind of interpolation used
for that makes a difference with regard to the precision particularly at
comparatively high frequencies.  Simple forms of interpolation will
cause fluctuations in the high frequency response.  With linear
interpolation, the frequency response will fluctuate between accurate
and a cosine bell shape.  That would be rather extreme in the high
range, so you want better than that.  The quality of interpolation will
be mostly audible in the high range, though, as long as you _do_
interpolate rather than skipping or duplicating samples (which would
result in clicks across the spectrum).
