That was my first approach but I couldn't find an affordable stereo EQ.
Most affordable devices are 2x15 or 2x31 and not 15 or 31 band stereo.
I don't want to set the channels seperately.

The output of the first adapter is used for
- direct monitoring
- headphone monitoring and mixing/mastering, but without EQ

Or you can simply wait til the "right" moment und use the original
values. But that would not use more CPU depending on the quality
setting. So there seems to bee an interpolation happening.

It looks as if I have to do a looptest (play through the 2nd interface
and record with the 1st) to get an impression how's the signal distorted
at the different quality settings.
