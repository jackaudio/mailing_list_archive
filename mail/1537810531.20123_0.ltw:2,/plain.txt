Subject:     [Jack-Devel] [ANN] QjackCtl 0.5.4 - An Early Autumn'18 Release

That's it!

  QjackCtl 0.5.4 (early-autumn'18) is out!


QjackCtl [1] is a(n ageing but still modern, maybe not so 'simple'
anymore) Qt [2] application to control the JACK [3] sound server, for
the Linux Audio [5] infrastructure.

Change-log:
- Graph port-type colors are now configurable (cf. menu View > Colors.
- Make Graph nodes (ie. client boxes) transparent for yet some
eye-candiness ;). Also keep the (Graph) current selection across port
(dis)connections.
- Drawing patchbay connector lines as (bezier) curves is now a
difinitive and fixed feature (as long as no moreremains from the so
called "Cambric explosion era" are still lurking in there).
- AppStream metadata updated to be the most compliant with latest
freedesktop.org specification and recommendation.
- Graph auto-layout improvement for brand new node clients.
- Avoid showing setup warning when no server settings have changed.
- Fixed JACK D-Bus settings for MIDI driver parameter.
