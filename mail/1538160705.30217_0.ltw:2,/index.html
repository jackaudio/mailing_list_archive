&gt; The output of the first adapter is used for
&gt; - direct monitoring

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As I played around with the quality setting (-q0 ... -q4) I noticed an
&gt; &gt; &gt; enormous CPU load with -q4 (sinc) but couldn't hear any differences in
&gt; &gt; &gt; audio quality. -q0 sounds as good as -q4.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now my question:
&gt; &gt; &gt; When the audioadapter has to resample to the same frequency (from 48000
&gt; &gt; &gt; to 48000), do higher -q settings improve the audio quality? As I
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand there is no interpolation needed at all so -q0 would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to have a perfect audio quality.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any comments/ideas to this?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Interpolation will be needed when the clocks drift.
&gt; 
&gt; Or you can simply wait til the "right" moment und use the original
&gt; values. But that would not use more CPU depending on the quality
&gt; setting. So there seems to bee an interpolation happening.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks as if I have to do a looptest (play through the 2nd interface
&gt; and record with the 1st) to get an impression how's the signal distorted
&gt; at the different quality settings.

I used the interface that's connected via audioadapter for playback and
the "main" interface that's directly controlled by jackd for recording.
As a signal source I used Audacity with generated sine waves of 5000 and
10000 Hz. I played this signal and recorded it (audio cable between
interfaces). The result showed that the signal gets indeed resampled and
that the quality setting matters.

q0 (SRC_LINEAR) and q1 (SRC_ZERO_ORDER_HOLD) showed a non-flat envelope
of the recorded signal - bad.

q2 (SRC_SINC_FASTEST) showed the desired flat envelope and seems to be
the best compromise between CPU load and quality.

-&gt; That's the setting I'll use from now on.

I cannot to further examination because the spectrum analyzer in
Audacity can't show the harmonics accurately. I expect a single peak in
a sine wave's spectrum but I got a softer curve.

SRC seems to bee an abbreviation for Secret Rabbit Code
