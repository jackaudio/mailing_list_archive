I used the interface that's connected via audioadapter for playback and
the "main" interface that's directly controlled by jackd for recording.
As a signal source I used Audacity with generated sine waves of 5000 and
10000 Hz. I played this signal and recorded it (audio cable between
interfaces). The result showed that the signal gets indeed resampled and
that the quality setting matters.

q0 (SRC_LINEAR) and q1 (SRC_ZERO_ORDER_HOLD) showed a non-flat envelope
of the recorded signal - bad.

q2 (SRC_SINC_FASTEST) showed the desired flat envelope and seems to be
the best compromise between CPU load and quality.

-> That's the setting I'll use from now on.

I cannot to further examination because the spectrum analyzer in
Audacity can't show the harmonics accurately. I expect a single peak in
a sine wave's spectrum but I got a softer curve.

SRC seems to bee an abbreviation for Secret Rabbit Code
