Hi,

Linking against the library is only the first problem. You have to build
the driver conditionally, or otherwise everyone are forced to use the
driver whenever the code hits master.

To link against your library you can add use='JACK1722DRIVER' to your
call to create_driver_obj. Just out of curiousity, is your standalone
library jack-specific (from the name it atleast seems to be)?

Regarding the help-text, please be consistent and follow the form of the
other options. The help for them is on the form 'Enable ${XYZ} driver'.
Thus, I would suggest the help for your option to be 'Enable IEEE1722
AVTP Mediaclock AVB driver'.

To build your driver conditionally you must add the conf_dest key to the
call to add_auto_option. I would suggest conf_dest='BUILD_DRIVER_1722'
or something similar that is consistent with the other options. Then in
the build_drivers function you must make the call to create_driver_obj
conditional on bld.env['BUILD_DRIVER_1722'] (or whatever conf_dest you
choose).

Lastly, I would highly recommend using pkg-config for your library, so
that jack only has to look for the *.pc file instead of searching for
the header and shared object separately.

Regards,
Karl
