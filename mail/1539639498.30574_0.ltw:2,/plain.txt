There is no simple answer, except "depends".

jack2: no.

jack1: yes, for client threads. jack1 also calls mlockall() and has a
blacklist of system-wide libs/path to not lock [1]. You can however
disable it with an option at compile and runtime.


Both jack1 and jack2's libjack's ringbuffer implementation has an API
jack_ringbuffer_mlock(), but that needs an explicit call.

Cheers!
