Can you try to run the version of jack included with Radium?
http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/demos/windows64/?C=M;O=D
Uninstall jack first, and then just run "qjackctl.exe" in the radium
directory.
You don't have to install anything.

This version of jack is compiled with a version of portaudio from 2016,
while the latest official
release of jack for windows includes a version of portaudio from 2012.
If it works, it's probably a good argument to speed up the process of making
a new release for windows.
