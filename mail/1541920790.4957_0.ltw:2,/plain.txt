Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] pa_process.c, Line 1558 with realtek asio driver

I doubt an explaination is needed but I'll give one anyway.
I've been trying to setup to use Synchronous Audio Router for about 2 weeks
to stream with ASIO and not WDM.
I am very confused I've looked at tons a videos on setting up Virtual Audio
cables I am thurallly confused and I need help!
I don't see this as the right place to ask for it but, I need someone that
can help me with this.  Streaming with twitch and keeping video game sound
and chat on different autio cables and how it all goes back into OBS and
Twtich audio chat.
There are lots of vidoes on using Jackrouter and it often uses ASIO4ALL and
I started to try and use Realtek, my video card's own driver and I ran into
this error so I figured I'd report it. I do not have Synconious Audio
Router installed yet. cause I figured I'd set up Jack first.

Sorry for the long explanation of mine of what I'm trying to do and how I
found the ASIO Realtek error.
