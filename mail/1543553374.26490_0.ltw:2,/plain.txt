Mixbus runs just fine without JACK. You only need jackd if you want to
route audio/midi between applications (think rewire), or if you have a
firewire/1394 soundcard).

In general we recommend to just use Mixbus/ALSA, that's a lot easier to
get started with and switch to jack only if you want to or need to.

AVLinux or KXStudio

Then again, AVLinux and KXStudio both have all this pre-configured.
AVLinux also comes with an exhaustive manual:

That is mostly personal taste.
