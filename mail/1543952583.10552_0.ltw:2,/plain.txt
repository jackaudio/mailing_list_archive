Subject:     [Jack-Devel] Two Jack daemons running

This is probably more a MixBus question, but why doesnt MixBus use the 
Jack buffersize and sample rate I configure. The two are completely 
different. Since MixBus uses jack how can it have different buffersizes 
and sampling rates.


I ask this question here because I noticed that there are two jack 
daemons running
jackd and
jackbus
and that certainly doesnt look right.

This is a clean installation of AVLinux and all I did was to install 
qjackctl
