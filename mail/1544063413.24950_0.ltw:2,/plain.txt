Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Jack and thunderbolt

I havenâ€™t measured lowest-possible latency, but I successfully use thunderbolt 3 from my HP laptop running Linux, via an Apple thunderbolt to FireWire adapter, to a Mackie Onyx FireWire mixer.  The mixer appears as a normal FireWire interface to Jack.
