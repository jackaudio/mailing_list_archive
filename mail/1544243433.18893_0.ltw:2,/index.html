&gt; Please reply to the mailing list and don't top-post.
&gt; 
&gt; That is probably a misunderstanding. The Presonus and the Focusrite 2nd
&gt; gen USB devices don't provide access to the device's internal routing
&gt; when using it with a Linux machine. They are class compliant and don't
&gt; need individual drivers. Sound devices that aren't class compliant need
&gt; an individual driver and there might be access to the device's internal
&gt; routing, as there is for some RME audio devices, when using the Linux's
&gt; hdspmixer wich is similar to RME's totalmix,
&gt; http://www.rme-audio.de/en/support/techinfo/hdsp_totalmix_software.php.
&gt; 
&gt; Monitoring without latency means, that you could route the input
&gt; channels, directly to the output channels. IOW if you connect a
&gt; microphone, you could listen to the unprocessed signal without latency,
&gt; it's not the signal processed by your Linux machine.
&gt; 

Thank you for the explanation.
That answers most of my questions very nicely, even ones I havent asked 
yet.

reply do not list the usergroup address but the poster so this will 
happen every now and then.
It involves reply all then remove the to: address and cut and paste the 
cc (which is the group address) into to: it is the way the group 
software adds addresses.
the group address should ideally be in the reply-to and not a cc, but I 
will do the abovementioned workaround.
