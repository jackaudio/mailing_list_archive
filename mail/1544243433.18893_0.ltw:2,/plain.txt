Thank you for the explanation.
That answers most of my questions very nicely, even ones I havent asked 
yet.

reply do not list the usergroup address but the poster so this will 
happen every now and then.
It involves reply all then remove the to: address and cut and paste the 
cc (which is the group address) into to: it is the way the group 
software adds addresses.
the group address should ideally be in the reply-to and not a cc, but I 
will do the abovementioned workaround.
