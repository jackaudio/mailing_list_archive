I don't know if this is the problem, but it looks like it.

The problem seems to be:

"jackd" needs to run by the same user as the clients.

(At least that's how it was in the old days, but maybe something
has changed since then).

E.g. If the process owner of jackd is root, you can't run jack_capture
as a  normal user.

I'm also pretty sure you can run several jackd simultaneously
on the same machine as long as each jackd is run by a different user.

&gt; Hey!
&gt;
&gt; Using the jack audio toolkit with my pisound DAC on a Raspberry Pi 3 which was a hassle - but I got it running with some hacks.
&gt;
&gt; Now for convenience I added jackd and jack_connect (to route input to output) as a service inside systemd - which works as expected. Before I could easily start jack_capture to record the input. But now it&#x2019;s not starting anymore unfortunately. I get this error:
&gt;
&gt; jack_capture -c 5 -mb -tm -f flac
&gt; Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory
&gt; Cannot connect to server request channel
&gt; jack server is not running or cannot be started
&gt; JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock
&gt; JackShmReadWritePtr::~JackShmReadWritePtr - Init not done for -1, skipping unlock
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; jack_client_open() failed, status = 0x11
&gt;
&gt; I copied jack_capture also to /usr/locale/bin
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My systemd service files:
&gt;
&gt; jack-connect.service &#x2014;&gt; starts also jackd.service
&gt; [Unit]
&gt; Description=jack-connect
&gt; Wants=jackd.service

&gt;
&gt; ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall jackd
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone help me with this?
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards
