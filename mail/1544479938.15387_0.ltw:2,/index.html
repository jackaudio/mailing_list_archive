&gt; Now for convenience I added jackd and jack_connect (to route input to

&gt; starting anymore unfortunately. I get this error:
&gt;
&gt; jack_capture -c 5 -mb -tm -f flac
&gt; Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory
&gt; Cannot connect to server request channel
&gt; jack server is not running or cannot be started

Probably as Kjetil wrote the user accounts are not the same.
In the [Service] section of the systemd file you can have User= and Group=
lines to set the user and group which the service should be run. Perhaps
if you make a user account and add that account in the systemd service
file and also log in as that user when you want to use jack_capture it
will still work as you would like.
