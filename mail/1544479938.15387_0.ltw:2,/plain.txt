Probably as Kjetil wrote the user accounts are not the same.
In the [Service] section of the systemd file you can have User= and Group=
lines to set the user and group which the service should be run. Perhaps
if you make a user account and add that account in the systemd service
file and also log in as that user when you want to use jack_capture it
will still work as you would like.
