Ah, that seems to be the problem! Thanks for the quick reply! 

My initial idea was to add this as well as a service but jack_capture needs user input - is this possible with a service? Like an additional script that triggers the recording?

&gt;&gt; Now for convenience I added jackd and jack_connect (to route input to
&gt;&gt; output) as a service inside systemd - which works as expected. Before I
&gt;&gt; could easily start jack_capture to record the input. But now it&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s not
&gt;&gt; starting anymore unfortunately. I get this error:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; jack_capture -c 5 -mb -tm -f flac
&gt;&gt; Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory
&gt;&gt; Cannot connect to server request channel
&gt;&gt; jack server is not running or cannot be started
&gt; 
&gt; Probably as Kjetil wrote the user accounts are not the same.
&gt; In the [Service] section of the systemd file you can have User= and Group=
&gt; lines to set the user and group which the service should be run. Perhaps
&gt; if you make a user account and add that account in the systemd service
&gt; file and also log in as that user when you want to use jack_capture it
&gt; will still work as you would like.
