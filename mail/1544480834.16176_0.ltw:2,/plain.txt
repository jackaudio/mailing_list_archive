If you need user input, will you be using jack_capture after logging in? A
service should just be for a program which runs constantly in the
background, jack_capture seems more of an interactive program, although
you could probably run in from something like a shell script.

Have you tried the suggested solution yet, add a new account that is used
both for running jackd as a service, and as your login account when you
want to run jack_capture?
