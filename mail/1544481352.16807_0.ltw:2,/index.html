Yes! Adding User / Group to the .service fixed the problem of not starting! Thanks a lot!

My setup would best look like this: 
The pisound has  a button. I have it now configured and working that when I press a button it runs a shell script which checks if my jackd service is running - if yes, stop else start (so one button solution to start / stop) - I need this because I couldn&#x2019;t figure out how to use Volumio with jack2 and to switch between Spotify/Airplay with Volumio - so this is a working workaround so far. 

Now I&#x2019;d like to start recording when doing a double-press on the button and stop it with the same double-press (it&#x2019;s a feature of the pisound).

&gt;&gt; My initial idea was to add this as well as a service but jack_capture

&gt; 
&gt; If you need user input, will you be using jack_capture after logging in? A
&gt; service should just be for a program which runs constantly in the
&gt; background, jack_capture seems more of an interactive program, although
&gt; you could probably run in from something like a shell script.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you tried the suggested solution yet, add a new account that is used
&gt; both for running jackd as a service, and as your login account when you
&gt; want to run jack_capture?
