that indeed looks like a solution! But I would need to know if jack_capture is recording to stop it again because I want to use a button to trigger start/stop of the recording - and I can&#x2019;t think of a solution right away. Good input for the recording directory - I was asking myself how to do that since I couldn&#x2019;t find that in the help file.

&gt;&gt; Ah, that seems to be the problem! Thanks for the quick reply!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My initial idea was to add this as well as a service but jack_capture needs user input - is this possible with a service? Like an additional script that triggers the recording?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How about letting jack_capture listen to OSC?
&gt; jack_capture --help-osc
&gt; 
&gt; Then you can run jack_capture as root like this:
&gt; 
&gt;   jack_capture --osc 7777 --filename-prefix
&gt; /recording/directory/jack_capture_recording_
&gt; 
&gt; And as a normal user you can run
&gt; 
&gt;   oscsend localhost 7777 /jack_capture/tm/start
&gt;   oscsend localhost 7777 /jack_capture/tm/stop
&gt; 
&gt; to start and stop recording.
&gt; 
&gt; Robin Gareus might help more on this, since he wrote that code.
&gt; I'm not entirely sure if this is the best way to use the OSC interface.
