Alright! I added everything… but I have some routing problems right now so I cannot install the osc package. Will try tomorrow.

I just tested the whole setup … and I get crackling when running jackd as mentioned above with systemd …does it run with another priority maybe? When using my old scripts to start jack2 everything is normal.
