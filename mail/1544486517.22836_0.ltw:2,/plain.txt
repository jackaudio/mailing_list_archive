You might not have the right privilege to run jackd as a normal user
with SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR priority (I.e realtime priority).

Try to run jackd manually in the shell as a normal user and see if it
shows a warning message about this.

If you do get a warning, there's probably some info at jackaudio.org
on how to enable realtime privileges for normal users, or you can
google it. I don't remember exactly how right now. :-)
