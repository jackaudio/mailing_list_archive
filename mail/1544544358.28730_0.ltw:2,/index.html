&gt; That is probably a misunderstanding. The Presonus and the Focusrite
&gt; 2nd gen USB devices don't provide access to the device's internal
&gt; routing when using it with a Linux machine. They are class compliant
&gt; and don't need individual drivers. Sound devices that aren't class
&gt; compliant need an individual driver and there might be access to the
&gt; device's internal routing, as there is for some RME audio devices,
&gt; when using the Linux's hdspmixer wich is similar to RME's totalmix,
&gt; http://www.rme-audio.de/en/support/techinfo/hdsp_totalmix_software.php.
&gt;
&gt; Monitoring without latency means, that you could route the input
&gt; channels, directly to the output channels. IOW if you connect a
&gt; microphone, you could listen to the unprocessed signal without
&gt; latency, it's not the signal processed by your Linux machine.

It's not entirely without latency since sample acquisition and
downsampling and interpolation filtering take its time as well, as to
the actual mixing and then going back into the analog domain with
similar measures.

I think it's in the order of 2ms of latency you have to take into
account.  It's not a lot but it certainly is latency.
