It's not entirely without latency since sample acquisition and
downsampling and interpolation filtering take its time as well, as to
the actual mixing and then going back into the analog domain with
similar measures.

I think it's in the order of 2ms of latency you have to take into
account.  It's not a lot but it certainly is latency.
