There are some interfaces which have an analog mixer on an output so that
you can mix the input signal and the returned signal from the computer
interface directly in the analog domain.  The only latency on the input
side is analog propagation delay, which is usually not worth discussing in
an audio context.  That style of interface can be really convenient for
portable setups where you don't want to carry a mixer or monitor
controller with you.
