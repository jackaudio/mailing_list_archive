&gt; I thought it was the last of my questions but I have two more, of this

&gt; My presonus 1818vsl seemingly defaults to 44100 Hz never mind if you
&gt; configure it to 96000Hz with the windows mixer.
&gt; It seems as soon as you close down the windows based presonus audiobox
&gt; software it defaults back to 44100Hz and soesnt keep it in memory when
&gt; you use it on Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1) I need to confirm the above.

I don't have this issue. The device works fine at 44.1k and 48k. I don't
use it at 96k.

I dimly recall users reporting various issues on Linux after using the
1717VSL on windows once, which resulted in a broken firmware update.
That was 2013-ish though. IIRC the solution was flashing the firmware.
That was reported on LAU or LAD.

If you still have access to a windows box, update the firmware as
described at
https://answers.presonus.com/17746/cannot-switch-samplerates-audiobox-1818vsl


&gt; Is there any way jack can report the bitrate of the data it receives
&gt; from usb driver
[..]

Probably not. Jack facilitates inter-application communication in
userspace. Hardware I/O on Linux happens at lower level.

you can try  https://community.ardour.org/files/adevices.sh which probes
/proc/asound/

Cheers!
