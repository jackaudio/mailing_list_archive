I don't have this issue. The device works fine at 44.1k and 48k. I don't
use it at 96k.

I dimly recall users reporting various issues on Linux after using the
1717VSL on windows once, which resulted in a broken firmware update.
That was 2013-ish though. IIRC the solution was flashing the firmware.
That was reported on LAU or LAD.

If you still have access to a windows box, update the firmware as
described at

Probably not. Jack facilitates inter-application communication in
userspace. Hardware I/O on Linux happens at lower level.

you can try  https://community.ardour.org/files/adevices.sh which probes
/proc/asound/

Cheers!
