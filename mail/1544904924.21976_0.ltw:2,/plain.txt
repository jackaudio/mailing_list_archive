Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] MacOS support

Is that CVS not outdated?

It sounds like there were updates to JackPilot well after SourceForge CVS
system became read-only. Maybe I'm reading these details wrong?

I'm happy to set up a TravisCI macOS build from a GitHub repo if the most
updated code gets there somehow... Perhaps a GitHub repo is a good place to
discuss the issues with this particular codebase too?

Please allow me to clarify, macOS "default audio device" support does not
work. You can only use JackPilot with supported applications (in my case
SuperCollider, Ableton Live, ROLI Equator).
