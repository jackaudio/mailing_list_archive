I am not positive I remember the details correctly, but I believe the auto
start behavior is a function of the application, not the jackd server.

Perhaps pulse expects jackd to be running when the module loads.  You may
have to start jackd manually, or switch to jackd v 2.

Something else, jackd v2 has dbus support, jackd v1 does not.  I believe
that applications are supposed to check ~/.jackdrc to determined the
desired default command line for the non-dbus version, I'm not sure how an
application would determine if the dbus version was available.  I guess it
could try starting the dbus version first, and if that did not work look
for a .jackdrc command, and if that was not available start jackd and
accept the default behavior.
