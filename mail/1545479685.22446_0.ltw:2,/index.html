Hi J&#xF6;rn

thanks for sharing this.

Some time ago I've also had to write systemd service units for running a
headless jackd in combination with "rotter" for a recording solution.

The service file is available at [1] and the documentation at [2] in
case you're interested. It supports multiple jackd instances (it was
written as a generic systemd service unit template) and uses the
"jack_wait" command to wait for jackd to be up and running. It was
designed to be as generic as possible an let the local administrator
configure certain settings using systemd service instance overrides (see
[3] for an example with alsa).

Best regards,
Chris

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; after scratching my head for a long time to make systemd behave when
&gt; running jack as a service, I thought I'd share my findings:
&gt; 
&gt; Example service file:
&gt; 
&gt; [Unit]
&gt; Description=JACK Audio Connection Kit
&gt; After=sound.target
&gt; After=ntp.service
&gt; After=time-sync.target
&gt; Before=jackd.target
&gt; Requires=jackd.target
&gt; 
&gt; [Service]
&gt; EnvironmentFile=-/your/config/file/containing/JACKD_OPTIONS
&gt; LimitRTPRIO=85
&gt; LimitMEMLOCK=700000000
&gt; User=nettings
&gt; Environment="DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/dbus/system_bus_socket"
&gt; 
&gt; ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10
&gt; ExecStart=/usr/bin/jackd $JACKD_OPTIONS
&gt; RestartSec=5
&gt; Restart=on-failure
&gt; 
&gt; [Install]
&gt; WantedBy=multi-user.target
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So it's easy to start a service as a user, but that user's environment
&gt; is not automatically pulled in. That means even though user nettings
&gt; does have the necessary permissions in /etc/security/limits.conf, you
&gt; still need to spell them out for systemd.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing to note is that at least on current raspbian, the
&gt; time-sync.target is broken. Its promise is to only be triggered after
&gt; ntp has worked its magic and the system time is monotonous. However,
&gt; I've seen time jumps which combined with cheap USB hardware or the
&gt; builtin Raspi sound will hang jack. Hence the ugly sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; Final goodness: systemd might try to clean up after you. So when you
&gt; have a jackd service started in your name, all is well, until you have
&gt; logged in somehow and then closed the last shell, at which point the
&gt; janitor from hell will happily clear /dev/shm and with it all your jack
&gt; semaphores, leading to instant dumpster fire and silence.
&gt; 
&gt; This magic can be avoided by setting
&gt; RemoveIPC=no
&gt; in /etc/systemd/logind.conf
&gt; 
&gt; After clearing these hurdles, I've been quite happy with how systemd
&gt; handles jack clients.&#xA0; The usecase here is a number of clients running
&gt; in an embedded appliance, and systemd takes care of restoring them when
&gt; I cause them to crash, which is good. Not that they crash, but it's good
&gt; to have defense in depth.
&gt; Figuring out how to order services is hard because you cannot assume a
&gt; service is really ready when systemd has fired it off. So I've used a
&gt; ExecStartPre script that blocks until a downstream jack port has
&gt; appeared in those cases where I want to start clients in a particular
&gt; order (matters most for the one job that needs to connect all the ports,
&gt; so I let it wait on a test port for each client it needs to connect).
&gt; 
&gt; Old-time SysV user here, and granted, systemd has given me many a WTF
&gt; moment, but it does its job. Unfortunately, it does too many other jobs
&gt; as well, but hey...
&gt;
