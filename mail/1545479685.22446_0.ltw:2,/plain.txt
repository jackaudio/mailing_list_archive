Hi Jörn

thanks for sharing this.

Some time ago I've also had to write systemd service units for running a
headless jackd in combination with "rotter" for a recording solution.

The service file is available at [1] and the documentation at [2] in
case you're interested. It supports multiple jackd instances (it was
written as a generic systemd service unit template) and uses the
"jack_wait" command to wait for jackd to be up and running. It was
designed to be as generic as possible an let the local administrator
configure certain settings using systemd service instance overrides (see
[3] for an example with alsa).

Best regards,
Chris
