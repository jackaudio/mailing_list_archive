It's a file where I keep all changes that are specific to a particular 
Raspi box, so that my service files are generic. If you're only 
interested in your one studio machine, you might as well not use it and 
hardcode the necessary jack options below.

Caveat: while you might think systemd can parse shell syntax, it really 
doesn't, its parser is very simple. So you have to make to with simple
KEY=value
pairs, even multiline variables will make it choke.
