Hey, nice, thanks. You are using a few features I didn't know yet, 
looking forward to checking them out. Especially "BindsTo" looks like it 
could be very useful (I found it explained in man systemd.units) - looks 
like any jack client service should be bound to Jack pretty much 
unconditionally unless it would survive the server going away and coming 
back somehow.
