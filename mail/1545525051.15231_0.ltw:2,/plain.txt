That is in fact the exact way I am going after long information 
gathering.
Motu is the way to go, separate stage mixer with user config monitoring, 
independent from web based <1ms web based mixer, and the USB compliant 
io you can use to record with mixbus etc (arrives at your USB interface 
on PC at about 1ms latency. I am getting a B16 stagemixer and the 
AVB/USB interface. Pricey, but it solves about every problem I had and 
then some.
I am selling off my Presonus and Steinberg gear. I really loved 
Steinberg, but the outright disregard for Linux that in my opinion 
exists at these companies makes it not palatable to own anymore. 
Presonus hardware in my opinion are great, but it is severely limited 
with little help when you ask to address the limitations which it was 
advertised as differently.

Just wish there were a mixbus mixer in one of these stagemixers.

I have gone through all the options and Motu  it is the only one 
standing. the responses I got from other manufacturers ranged from the 
comical to outright ignorance of what users need.

I have a feeling that AVB/IEEE  will win over the ultranet stuff from 
Sony that is now licvensed out to someone handling it. that looks like a 
disaster to me. I am not going to invest in an interface that Sony the 
inventor did not want to pursue, it means that the profit margin must be 
about zero.

We have unfortunaltely a bit of VHS vs Betamax again with AVB vs 
Ultranet, but I sure find AVB the better horse to bet on.
