Hey all,

until now, I have to admit, I never heard of Sonys solution. And I don't think it will become relevant.

The following is my opinion, fuled by some presentations and discussions from the last AES convention.

AES67 + ST2110 
vs.
AVB 
are Beta vs VHS in my opinion.

Dante will be overcome as soon as people realize, that point to point connections are obsolete and open standards are better suited for such endevours.
A transformation of the mindset is required and slowly coming.

However, Meyersound, L'Acoustics and d&amp;b Audio have set AVB as the standard for sound reinforcement systems. done.
AVB has become the standard for automotive networking as well. done.

AES67 is not specified for IPv6. With the stupidest of all explanations: we don't need it.
AVB is agnostic to it, because it is layer 2. Yes, you would need an IPv6 gateway...

AVB takes so long to get to the market, because it is trying to provide the best solution for packet based networks. That requires hardware support, which is not that trivial. AES67 is just some solution among others, this is a relabeled set of VoIP standards with some extensions (without proper standardized discovery mechanisms (SAP, ZeroConf, or whatever...) - why specifying AES67, when interoperability is not the goal???).
AVB provides deterministic networking! you know what will happen!
But this results in long development of reliable equipment, that conforms to the standards.
Interoperability was also a big issue for AVB, but the MILAN protocol handles this now.

But for educational purposes, AES67 is the best way to learn about Audio over IP. You can actually use VLC.

My 50 cents...

BR,
Ck

&gt;I think I meant Ultramac not ultranet was the Sony invention licensed 
&gt;out, anyway, I quoted from memory so it might not be right, but I gave 
&gt;up on those protocols over AVB.
