Thank you Christoph.

Stellar summary that can be of use to many and most importantly 
arguments concisely expressed.

Exactly as I see it, but did not formulate it as well as you did.

This post has been a great help to me and definitely settles the choice 
I will make thanks.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; until now, I have to admit, I never heard of Sonys solution. And I 
&gt; don't
&gt; think it will become relevant.
&gt; 
&gt; The following is my opinion, fuled by some presentations and 
&gt; discussions
&gt; from the last AES convention.
&gt; 
&gt; AES67 + ST2110
&gt; vs.
&gt; AVB
&gt; are Beta vs VHS in my opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; Dante will be overcome as soon as people realize, that point to point
&gt; connections are obsolete and open standards are better suited for such
&gt; endevours.
&gt; A transformation of the mindset is required and slowly coming.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Meyersound, L'Acoustics and d&amp;b Audio have set AVB as the
&gt; standard for sound reinforcement systems. done.
&gt; AVB has become the standard for automotive networking as well. done.
&gt; 
&gt; AES67 is not specified for IPv6. With the stupidest of all 
&gt; explanations:
&gt; we don't need it.
&gt; AVB is agnostic to it, because it is layer 2. Yes, you would need an
&gt; IPv6 gateway...
&gt; 
&gt; AVB takes so long to get to the market, because it is trying to provide
&gt; the best solution for packet based networks. That requires hardware
&gt; support, which is not that trivial. AES67 is just some solution among
&gt; others, this is a relabeled set of VoIP standards with some extensions
&gt; (without proper standardized discovery mechanisms (SAP, ZeroConf, or
&gt; whatever...) - why specifying AES67, when interoperability is not the
&gt; goal???).
&gt; AVB provides deterministic networking! you know what will happen!
&gt; But this results in long development of reliable equipment, that
&gt; conforms to the standards.
&gt; Interoperability was also a big issue for AVB, but the MILAN protocol
&gt; handles this now.
&gt; 
&gt; But for educational purposes, AES67 is the best way to learn about 
&gt; Audio
&gt; over IP. You can actually use VLC.
&gt; 
&gt; My 50 cents...

&gt;     Correction to my mail:
&gt;     I think I meant Ultramac not ultranet was the Sony invention 
&gt; licensed
&gt;     out, anyway, I quoted from memory so it might not be right, but I 
&gt; gave
&gt;     up on those protocols over AVB.
