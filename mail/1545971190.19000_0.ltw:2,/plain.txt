All jack clients run at the same buffer size.
I think you could make a client which stored multiple buffers and handled
the appropriate translation between buffer sizes, but I am not aware if
Pulse does this.  The pulse jack implementation has in the past been
described as not optimal.

Do you need such low latency for Mixbus?  Increasing the latency would be
the simplest thing to check if you are having problems with under-runs.

Check the default sample rate which pulseaudio uses, and the sample rate
of the applications which connect through pulse.  PulseAudio will use
sample rate conversion when clients and default sample rate do not match,
that causes higher CPU usage and decrease in audio quality.

The jack server requires exclusive use of an output device, so you must be
using the jack-sink client of pulse audio to send the audio to jack for
output to the physical device.

That would be the optimal solution.
