Not true. For years I have the same setup on different Linux computers:

- "autospawn = no" in /etc/pulse/client.conf
- "load-module module-jack-source" and "load-module module-jack-sink" in
  /etc/pulse/default.pa
- A shell script running under my userid started by my desktop
  environment that starts jackd and then pulseaudio
  (Alternatively you can start qjackctl that starts jackd and
  pulseaudio)

That means jack is my main audio system and always active. Pulseaudio is
always active, too.
