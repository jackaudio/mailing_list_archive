That is a cool feature, I guess.

Right, I don't think the original poster has clarified why jackd use is
desired rather than native OS audio.

That I can answer:
"Uses LTC Timecode according to SMPTE-12M Standard"

Last year sometime I helped someone check recordings made with a digital
camera and a Tentacle device to generate timecode, ltc-tools could decode
it with no problem, and ardour imported to a video timeline mostly with no
problems (there were some issues with the variable frame rate video
encoding used by the camera by default, but I don't think that is
pertinent here).
