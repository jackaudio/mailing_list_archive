Jack audio server does not access the audio devices directly, it uses the
operating system drivers.  As long as your audio device has drivers the
audio device should work.
You did not say which operating system you use, ALSA on Linux, CoreAudio
on MacOS, I think on Windows jack server uses the PortAudio library for
accessing the audio device, which can use more than one Windows API to
access the device.
