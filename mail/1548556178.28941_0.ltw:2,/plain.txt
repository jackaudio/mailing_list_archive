Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Need some help with Jack

Greetings,

I think it is not possible to get audio from Mainstage into Jack on any
recent macOS.  Ableton does support Jack though.

It looks like using ReWire, Mainstage has to be the "host" and Ableton the
"device".  This is probably not what you want - it basically reduces
Ableton to built-in software synths on MIDI tracks.

I'd try Soundflower or Loopback.  *sigh*
