&gt; Hey mate.
&gt;
&gt; I have recently installed a copy of JACK onto my MAC and have been
&gt; trying to use Mainstage 3 in Ableton live. I can't seem to figure out
&gt; how to do this and was wondering if you could help me out as I just
&gt; paid apple $47 for there instruments and can't use them.

Sorry not to be of any help regarding the actual question here.  I don't
really want to engage in fingerpointing here: it is not like the
question's stance would be all that unusual.  And I don't have a
personal investment here either so I don't have standing to complain
either.

That being said I find it irritating that the expected flow of help and
the flow of money used for justifying that expectation are so entirely
orthogonal here.  As I said: this is not really unusual.

Does anybody have a good idea what it would take to make it unusual?
