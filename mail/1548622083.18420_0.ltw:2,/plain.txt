Sorry not to be of any help regarding the actual question here.  I don't
really want to engage in fingerpointing here: it is not like the
question's stance would be all that unusual.  And I don't have a
personal investment here either so I don't have standing to complain
either.

That being said I find it irritating that the expected flow of help and
the flow of money used for justifying that expectation are so entirely
orthogonal here.  As I said: this is not really unusual.

Does anybody have a good idea what it would take to make it unusual?
