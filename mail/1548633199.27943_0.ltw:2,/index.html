I ended up getting a refund on mainstage 3 and buying a vst synth instead.

&gt; &gt; Hey mate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have recently installed a copy of JACK onto my MAC and have been
&gt; &gt; trying to use Mainstage 3 in Ableton live. I can't seem to figure out
&gt; &gt; how to do this and was wondering if you could help me out as I just
&gt; &gt; paid apple $47 for there instruments and can't use them.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry not to be of any help regarding the actual question here.  I don't
&gt; really want to engage in fingerpointing here: it is not like the
&gt; question's stance would be all that unusual.  And I don't have a
&gt; personal investment here either so I don't have standing to complain
&gt; either.
&gt;
&gt; That being said I find it irritating that the expected flow of help and
&gt; the flow of money used for justifying that expectation are so entirely
&gt; orthogonal here.  As I said: this is not really unusual.
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody have a good idea what it would take to make it unusual?
