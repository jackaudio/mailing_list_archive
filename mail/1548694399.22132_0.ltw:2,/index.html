&gt; One thing you should check is that there is an API defined for metadata in

Sorry, a little bit of bad form to reply to my own post instead of just
including this in the first message, but I did not think to look up the
URL before I hit send.  In case you have not found these links already:

This is the definition of the metadata API:
http://jackaudio.org/api/group__Metadata.html

The top level links to the API documentation:
http://jackaudio.org/api/index.html

Possibly the session API may be of use as well, I am not really familiar
with session tools.  It seems like possibly they could do what you want,
but there was a lot of churn for a while, and it seemed like there was
never a consensus which developed fully around multi-application session
store and restore.
Have you investigated something like ladish to see if it can restore the
connections like you want?  Or maybe I have misunderstood your end goal.
