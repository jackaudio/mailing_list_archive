Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Adjustable port alias limit

Apologies all, and Chris, new to responding to mailing lists, accidentally
responded directly to Chris
Here follows the thread so far:

I thought about the metadata system, which i thought i had read had
recently been included in 2? but i wouldnt be able to rely on
jack-matchmakers port regex matching to automatically connect these group
aliased ports to appropriately named ardour buses, necessitating me to
write my own auto connect daemon with its own matching logic, possibly
involving assigning meta data to ardours ports as well. I felt adjusting
the alias functionality to remove the, surprising to me atleast, two alias
limit, was the easier route that i could perhaps then contribute to the
project.
If it turns out this patch is unincludable, or metadata or is simply
ultimately the better way to achieve this, I'll be happy to maintain this
patch locally until I can get around to writing or finding the tooling I
would need. or if there is something already existing that I have missed

It is primarily ports that are not always available or may disappear at any
time. VCV Rack and netjack workers primarily. which i would like to group
into mono, stereo, surround etc pairs. I have these things autoconnecting
to ardour buses which are distributed to tracks, so that I dont need to
remember to reconnect them to every track.
The workflow I have now is something like, name an ardour bus, run the
group command over the desired ports, and issue a reload to
jack-matchmaker(as it doesnt monitor port aliasing).
Admittedly, the limit does not much get in the way of this, its not likely
I will desire to add a port to more than one group, but i would certainly
like the ability, perhaps for creating weird stereo images out of vcv, but
the limit, considering it is global for both port owners and non, feels
tight, and could cause surprises/cognitive overhead for me when say,
switching between grouping schemes

Additionally Chris mentioned the session api, and ladish, in a follow up
message to their own, which I forgot to address.
Perhaps a session system could do what I need/better address my needs, I'll
admit it's something I need to look into better, it hadnt occurred to me at
the point where I felt the need to patch jack to enable more aliases, but I
figure now that i've done the work, why not see if the jack team desires it.
