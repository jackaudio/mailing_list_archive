it takes some info for the group and a pattern string to match against
ports, you'd need to determine manually which ports belong to which device
and supply them. from there one of the devices ports would possess
predictable and unique names to restore connections against. the script and
patch were written with grouping audio in mind, but it could be used to
somewhat solve this I suppose
