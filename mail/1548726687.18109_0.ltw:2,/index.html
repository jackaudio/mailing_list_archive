Actually I'm realizing now, that the port names are identical in this
situation? in which case the script would end up assigning ports from both
devices to a single group, probably with unpredictable ordering, so ends up
not being a solution. only solution here would be for the midi drivers to
not assign identical names to devices, possibly by finding some manner of
unique ID to append. I dont think this patch is relevant to this problem.

&gt; it takes some info for the group and a pattern string to match against
&gt; ports, you'd need to determine manually which ports belong to which device
&gt; and supply them. from there one of the devices ports would possess
&gt; predictable and unique names to restore connections against. the script and
&gt; patch were written with grouping audio in mind, but it could be used to
&gt; somewhat solve this I suppose
&gt; &gt;Have you ever used two or more identical PCI cards as MIDI interface?
&gt; I've not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;FWIW apart from jack audio, there are also jack and ALSA midi
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;available. AFAIK when for example using two TerraTec EWX 24/96 PCI
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;cards as MIDI interfaces, there is no way at all to restore MIDI
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;connections automatically. The only way is to do all MIDI IO
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;connections with those cards manually. Even changing the name of at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;least one card, does only affect audio, the MIDI names of identical
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PCI cards are always the same.
&gt;&gt; &gt;I'll admit i am not sure what your general thought here is? depending
&gt;&gt; &gt;on the method used to restore connections, with the script I wrote one
&gt;&gt; &gt;of these devices could be oneshot assigned group aliases for its midi
&gt;&gt; &gt;ports, and then connections restored from there
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How does your script find out to what card it assigned the aliases?
