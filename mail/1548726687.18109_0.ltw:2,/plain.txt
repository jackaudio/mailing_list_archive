Subject:     Re: [Jack-Devel] Adjustable port alias limit

Actually I'm realizing now, that the port names are identical in this
situation? in which case the script would end up assigning ports from both
devices to a single group, probably with unpredictable ordering, so ends up
not being a solution. only solution here would be for the midi drivers to
not assign identical names to devices, possibly by finding some manner of
unique ID to append. I dont think this patch is relevant to this problem.
